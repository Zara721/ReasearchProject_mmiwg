That number is considerably higher than the national average of 67 per cent.\nJackie Carmichael\nMay 8, 2023 11:43 AM\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nPrevious\nNext\n1 / 2 St. Albert's Alanna Tyler(l) and Rhonda Wood-Viscarra (r) pose outside city hall in Edmonton on Red Dress day to remind Albertans of missing and murdered Indigenous women who have not returned home . JACKIE CARMICHAEL/ St. Albert Gazette\nExpand\nListen to this article\n00:05:01\n\nOn the river behind St. Albert Place, at the Healing Gardens, red dresses wafted on the Friday breeze, their fabric billowing then going slack as if haunted by memories of the missing and slain.\n\nIt was Red Dress Day\u2014a reminder of the nation\u2019s missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nIt\u2019s the second year of\u00a0co-organizing the display for St. Albert\u2019s Cheryl Lundy-Stuart.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very powerful to see them flow in the wind, they seem to come alive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite overwhelming.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe dresses tell stories, with attached photos and remembrances.\n\n\u201cEach dress tells the story of one of the many women who never had a chance to live,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\nLast year, a similar display at the site stayed up from May 5 to the July 1 Run for Reconciliation.\n\nA book in a plastic container invites site visitors to record their thoughts on seeing the moving display.\n\nDisplay co-organizer and St. Albert resident Amanda Patrick was raised with some Indigenous culture in her M\u00e9tis\u00a0family.\n\n\u201cI spent the last few years trying to find my place as a M\u00e9tis\u00a0woman,\u201d Patrick said.\n\nThe red dress display came from that impulse, she said.\n\nPatrick has had a family member living a high-risk lifestyle, who went missing but then was found safely. She\u2019s shocked by the statistics.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOnce you start reading, the facts are crazy,\u201d Patrick said.\n\n\u201cIn 2022, there were over 600 missing alerts\u2014two-thirds of the missing alerts were for Indigenous people,\u201d she said.\n\nAbout 84 per cent of cases in Alberta are murder cases, according to the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC). That number is considerably higher than the national average of 67 per cent.\n\nAbout 70 per cent of the Alberta cases involve women between the ages of 18 and 44.\n\nToo often cases of missing Aboriginal women are stereotyped and/or dismissed as involving only \u2018run-aways,\u2019 the NWAC release said.\n\n\u201cNot only is this untrue, it implies that young girls that do \u2018run-away\u2019 are somehow undeserving of attention or protection,\u201d it said.\n\nThe vast majority of cases of known individuals in Alberta (almost 90 per cent) involve mothers.\n\nSome 76 per cent of Alberta\u2019s missing women and girls disappeared from an urban area, which is higher than the national average.\n\n\u201cIn Alberta, only 42 per cent of murder cases in NWAC\u2019s database have been cleared by charges of homicide. This is far lower than the national average of 53 per cent,\u201d the release said.\n\nHowever the percent of cases cleared by suicide is among the highest in Canada\u2014almost three times higher than the national average.\n\nOverall, the percentage of unsolved cases in Alberta is still comparable to the national average\u2014 42 per cent in Alberta.\n\nIndigenous women in beautifully adorned traditional red skirts on Friday morning at City Hall in Edmonton for National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and Two-Spirit people.\u00a0\n\nA long name to address longstanding injustices, the day brought Rhonda Wood-Viscarra out to bring attention to entrenched and shameful truths. A member of the St.Albert-Sturgeon County Metis Local #1904, she cited numbers from the NWAC that show provincial statistics here are worse even than the still-shocking Canadian averages for Aboriginal women and girls in Alberta who go missing or are murdered.\n\n\u201cThere are 93 cases of missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls in Alberta. This accounts for 16 per cent of all cases in NWAC\u2019s database,\u201d a NWAC release said.\n\nThe number of cases in Alberta is second only to British Columbia (which accounts for about 28 per cent of all cases)\n\n\u201cNinety-three cases in Alberta, that\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Wood-Viscarra said, the morning sun glinting off her traditionally beaded earrings in the shape of red dresses.\n\n\u201cAs Indigenous women, we have to stand up for our sisters who have gone missing,\u201d\n\nIndigenous women who go missing are just as important as non-Indigenous, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for Alberta to take a stand, and not just talk. We need action,\u201d Wood-Viscarra said.\n\nAlanna Tyler, also of the Metis Local #1904 for St. Albert/Sturgeon County, said attention must be paid.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough recognition in Alberta and Canada when our indigenous people go missing. You don\u2019t get the same response,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cWe need to see follow-ups, we need to see action. That\u2019s what today is all about.\u201d\n\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nNot Very\n\t\nSlightly\n\t\nFairly\n\t\nVery\n\t\nExtremely\nComments 0\n\t\tShow\nMore Local News\n\tCanadian accessible reading resources evolving despite braille book famine\n\tBREAKING: Senior charged with shooting of St. Albert teen denied bail\n\tCessation of Legal Aid services looming, gov't offers to extend funding\nSee a typo/mistake?\nHave a story/tip?\nEmail\nSign Up\nSPOTLIGHT\nIntemperance Studio: Transforming Lives One Strand at a Time \nThe ALS Society of Alberta \u2013 Making a Difference Every Day \nSunrise Home Buyers: A New Way To Sell Your House Fast and Hassle-Free\n\nMORE SPOTLIGHT >\n\nLATEST POLL\nWhat is St. Albert's ideal population for you?\nview related story\n More than 100,000 people\n 90,000 sounds fine\n 80,000 tops\n No more than 75,000\n We're too big already\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nRECENT LOCAL NEWS\nCanadian accessible reading resources evolving despite braille book famine\nBREAKING: Senior charged with shooting of St. Albert teen denied bail\nCessation of Legal Aid services looming, gov't offers to extend funding\nSt. Albert RCMP looking for man who asked teen girls for sex\n   \nNews\nLocal News\nLocal Sports\nClimate\nLocal Arts and Culture\nLocal Entertainment\nLifestyle News\nLocal Business\nLocal Opinion\nBeyond Local\nAlberta News\nAlberta Sports\nIndigenous Alberta\nNational News\nNational Sports\nNational Business\nNational Entertainment\nCOVID-19\nFeatures\nSpotlight\nContests\nLowest Gas Prices\nDigital Edition, Archives, Print Features\nDigital Archive\nDear Abby\nHoroscopes\n2024 Graduation Keepsake\n2024 St. Albert Gazette Readers' Choice\nHot Summer Guide\nHome Sweet Home\nObits\nIn Memoriam\nObituaries\nEvents\nView Events\nSubmit an Event\nAdvertise in Calendar\nDiscover Local\nDiscover Local\nRestaurants\nClassifieds\nPost an Ad\nMy Ads\nMy Account\nToday's Classified Ads\nGarage Sales\nJobs\nPublic Notices\nGeneral Notices\nLegal Notices\nMunicipal Notices\nProvincial Notices\nOpen Houses\nConnect\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nSign up for FREE daily headlines\nSign up for Notifications\nAdvertising\nMake Us Your Home Page\nGreat West Digital Agency\nFollow Us on Facebook\nFollow Us on X\nFollow Us on Threads\nFollow Us on Instagram\nFollow Us on LinkedIN\nAbout\nAbout Us\nAdvertising\nCommunity Guidelines\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nVisit our network of sites:\nAirdrie City View/Rocky View Weekly\nCochrane Eagle\nJasper Fitzhugh\nLakelandTODAY.ca\nRocky Mountain Outlook\nSt. Albert Gazette\nThe Albertan\nTownandCountryTODAY.com\nWestern Wheel\n\n\u00a9 2024 St. Albert Gazette\n\n\u00d7\nBe the first to read breaking stories.

There is also a contest, share your stories with us \u2013https://tinyurl.com/NHWeek-Contest\n\nSome of you may have noticed a slight adjustment of our name to Alex House. While our team and volunteers often use Alex House as our nickname, we decided to embrace it formally in an effort to move away from the colonizing history of our historic namesake Queen Alexandra.\n\nPeople often ask me why we made this change, and I share that it stems from learning about our history.\n\nAs a neighbourhood house our history is steeped in the social justice movement.\n\nJust prior to the turn-of-the-century, the settlement movement began in London, where settlement workers lived in community with the people they served. At the time this was a radical new way of working with people.\n\nFrom this work Toynbee Hall, the first settlement house/neighbourhood house, was established. The movement grew across the U.S., Canada, and throughout the world.\n\nHowever, the good intentions of the settlement movement also inadvertently contributed to colonization. This is the Truth that needs acknowledgement before Reconciliation can happen.\n\nOver the past few years we, at Alex House, have been actively learning about the impact of colonization, and are working to decolonize our approach. While we are learners in this work we are deeply committed to seeing our work through a decolonized lens. We have had Indigenous teachers along the way, helping us to build understanding, while holding us accountable. Ta7tal\u00edya Nahanee of S\u1e35wx\u0331w\u00fa7mesh \u00daxwumixw, helped kick start this journey for us through her work with Nahanee Creative, while her daughter Ta7tal\u00edya-men Paisley Nahanee created our new logo, which includes Coast Salish lines, serving as an aspirational image for all of us at Alex House.\n\nOver the next few months I will be sharing our decolonizing journey, interwoven with stories from our neighbourhood, with the hope that it will demystify this work, and encourage our community to learn alongside us at Alex House.\n\nYou can also check out our website for additional background and resources www.alexhouse.net. With respect, and gratitude we operate on the stolen land of the Coast Salish people, locally the Semiamha (Semiahmoo), Katzie, and Kwantlen people. We do not use the word stolen to be provocative, but rather to state the truth of what unceded means.\n\nPerhaps one day we will simply state we are on the land of the Coast Salish people, but today we feel it is important to state the truth, in order to move towards reconciliation.\n\nI understand the word stolen stings, but our job as settlers is to fully understand the impact of colonization and sometimes it is uncomfortable.\n\nIn light of this work, it is important to note that May 5 is Red Dress Day, also known as National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and 2S People. Since 2010 May 5 has been a day to bring awareness to the lost lives of Indigenous women, girls and 2S people in Canada. Red Dress Day was inspired by Metis artist Jamie Black\u2019s REDress Project installation which displayed red dresses to represent the missing Indigenous women and girls who have been disproportionately impacted by violence.\n\nA 2019 Inquiry highlighted 231 Calls for Justice, and section 15 outlines Calls for Justice for all Canadians. To honour the Indigenous women whose lives have been lost due to violence, start by reading section 15, and begin taking action. To get you started \u2013 15.1 Denounce and speak out against violence towards Indigenous Women, Girls and 2S people.\n\nWe all have an important part to play in the effort to reduce violence and oppression against Indigenous people.\n\nAnd on a lighter note, on May 27 and 28, we will host the 47th Alex Festival. It is hard to believe that this grassroots, volunteer-driven festival has been hosted in Crescent Beach for over 47 years.\n\nThis year the festival will be held over two days.\n\nOn Saturday, May 27, we will host our traditional event for families with performances, a marketplace, children\u2019s activities, and food vendors, while on Sunday, May 28, we will be offering a music festival for people 19-plus, with a beer garden, food and vendors.\n\nBoth days are by donation/pay what you can, and we hope you will join us, and help celebrate our community!\n\nPenny Bradley (she/her) is a third generation settler of Welsh descent, living and working on the stolen land of Semiahmoo Nation, with her partner, son, and very needy dog.

They are also 12 times more likely to be missing or murdered than non-Indigenous women.\n\nA 2014 RCMP report suggested some 1,200 Indigenous woman and girls have gone missing or been killed in Canada, but underreporting and a lack of data means that number is likely inaccurate.\u00a0Other estimates have since pegged the true number at more than 4,000.\n\nEdmonton's breaking news sent to your email as it happens.\n\n\u201cWe all know somebody who is either gone missing or has been murdered,\u201d Kelly Penner, vice-president of the Fraser Valley M\u00e9tis Association, told Global News.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAn important part of Red Dress Day is generating meaningful discussion about what needs to change, and what actions can be taken to break the cycle of violence, she added.\n\n2:03\nSewing red ribbon skirts in honour of MMIWG\n\nThe national inquiry called the MMIWG2S crisis a \u201cgenocide,\u201d and released 231 calls for justice from governments, institutions, service providers and individuals that would address its root causes. The calls, described as \u201clegal imperatives,\u201d target\u00a0governments, institutions, social service providers, industries and all Canadians.\n\nIn the nearly four years that have passed since then, as critics \u2014 including the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada \u2014 have said little has been done to implement them and the outcomes haven\u2019t changed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough being done,\u201d said Fleury. \u201cThere should be more investigations, it should be more lengthy \u2026 I think it stems, honestly, from our system still being systemically racist.\u201d\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n2:28\nFinal MMIWG report released and calls for systemic change\n\nIn June 2021, the federal government released its national action plan for addressing the inquiry\u2019s calls.

And in 2017, actress Alyssa Milano tweeted, \u201cif you\u2019ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write \u2018me too\u2019 as a reply to this tweet.\u201d Her tweet sparked a whirlwind of social media posts that highlighted a gender-based violence crisis.\n\nWhile hashtag activism and Hollywood are synonymous with gender-based violence advocacy, there are dynamic projects raising awareness across Canada. M\u00e9tis artist Jaime Black\u2019s REDress Project and Leah Parsons\u2019 Memory Stones Project are examples of such creative and collaborative anti-violence efforts.\n\nThe REDress Project sees red dresses suspended where you would least expect them. Black is an artist-activist \u2014 or \u201cartivist\u201d \u2014 from Winnipeg, Man., who started the project in order to call attention to Canada\u2019s Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) crisis. The crisis has seen thousands of Indigenous women go missing or be killed since the 1970s.\n\nIn the Memory Stones Project, Parsons collects stones from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, then paints them with bright colours and cheerful symbols to honour her daughter, Rehtaeh. Rehtaeh died by suicide after she was allegedly sexually assaulted by four boys and relentlessly victim-blamed. Each memory stone is hidden outdoors with a note that describes Rehtaeh\u2019s experience. It urges anyone who finds the stone to \u201cshow kindness not hate\u201d to survivors and \u201cleave the stone\u201d to share Rehtaeh\u2019s message with others.\n\nPeople across the globe have gotten involved in the Memory Stones Project. (Angel Rehtaeh Parsons), Author provided\n\nAs the Government of Canada points out, certain people including \u201cwomen; young women and girls; Indigenous women and girls; LGBTQIA2S+; transgender and gender diverse people; women living in Northern, rural and remote communities; and, women living with disabilities\u201d are more likely to experience gender-based violence.\n\nIn Canada, one in four women report gender-based violence to authorities, while many cases go unreported due to fear of stigma and victim-blaming. Indigenous women in particular face gender-based violence 16 times more than white women in Canada do. They also experience more severe assaults.\n\nAfter interviewing Black and Parsons for my research, studying their projects and speaking with people who engaged with them, what stands out is how both projects attract eager co-operation from everyday people \u2014 which is important for raising awareness.\n\nWhen activists use materials that anyone can acquire, and invite citizens to co-create alongside them, it inspires people to jump on board.\n\nCollaborative activism\n\nDuring my conversations with Black and Parsons, they both mentioned being fed up with the normalization of gender-based violence, so they struck out on their own to address it. While these acts appear to be singular undertakings, they\u2019ve both inspired impressive participation.\n\nThe REDress Project gained international attention, but its collaborative origins are little known. In 2010, Black called on Canadians to donate dresses and received over 600 garments. She told me that people have donated every dress she\u2019s used since.\n\nREDress-inspired projects regularly pop up. An Edmontonian started a \u201cREDress Photography Project\u201d in 2015, while Inuit installed a Red Amautiit Project in Nunavut in 2019. These creators, who were inspired by Black\u2019s work, ensured first that she would be comfortable with them building on her idea. In fact, Black tells me she believes in \u201cdecolonizing the idea of art being exclusive.\u201d She believes that this helps it \u201cgrow and evolve beyond its maker.\u201d\n\nThe National Museum of the American Indian showcases The REDress Project.\n\nParsons\u2019 Memory Stones Project also inspires engagement. After seeing memory stones on the Angel Rehtaeh Parsons Facebook page, people request stones so they can place them too.\n\nParsons tells me she\u2019s painted thousands of memory stones to date, mailing them to people in \u201cmany places \u2026 Africa, China, Alaska, British Columbia, California, Germany, New Zealand, Dakar, Cambodia and more\u201d. She instructs recipients to place the stone somewhere that speaks to them and send Parsons a photograph.\n\nMy interviews with people who have come across Parsons\u2019 stones revealed that finding the stone helped them reflect on the importance of consent. By placing stones and sharing Rehtaeh\u2019s story, people are helping draw attention to gender-based violence.\n\nReplicability\n\nThese activisms\u2019 uptake, in part, relies on the fact that they are easy to replicate. Black uses an everyday item, dresses, to raise awareness. Parsons uses stones, paint and varnish, which are easily acquired.\n\nThese projects demonstrate that with inspiration, people can use accessible objects and skills they already have to participate in anti-violence activism.\n\nBlack\u2019s and Parsons\u2019 initiatives were meant to inspire involvement. Black invites Canadians to hang their own red dresses to raise awareness and Parsons not only provides stones to people who request them, but encourages them to get involved through social media. On her Facebook page, she gives a blessing and instructions to those who want to paint stones at home and asks people to post photos online.\n\nBecause gender-based violence kills a woman every second day in Canada, it can feel overwhelming to try to address it. This is one of the reasons projects that are easy to participate in and reproduce, and that make people feel like they are part of a community that cares, are important.\n\nThis is an updated version of a story originally published on May 4, 2021.

The Sisters in Spirit vigils bear witness to this national tragedy and offer solace to families and communities that have suffered the devastating loss of so many loved ones.\n\n\u201cOur government takes this issue to heart. We\u2019ve invested in women\u2019s shelters so that no one will be turned away, and in sexual assault centres and violence-prevention programs so that survivors have greater access to counselling, police and court supports.\n\n\u201cWe also passed the Residential Tenancies Amendment Act so that survivors of domestic violence can legally break a residential lease. And we\u2019ve given survivors of sexual violence better access to the legal system by removing the time limit to bring forward civil claims.\n\n\u201cIn the spirit of reconciliation, our government apologized in 2015 for the legacy of residential schools. In May of this year, we apologized to survivors of the Sixties Scoop.\n\n\u201cOur greatest hope is that these vigils, along with better supports for women, the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, Alberta\u2019s Taking Action Against Racism plan and resolute efforts at every level of society, will help achieve meaningful action to ensure the safety and security of Indigenous women and girls here in Alberta and across Canada.\n\n\u201cI ask Albertans to join me in taking time to remember these women and girls \u2013 cherished sisters, mothers, daughters, granddaughters \u2013 and all who seek and mourn for them. In their ever-present memory, let us make the world a safer place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTAGS\nAlberta\nfamilies of sisters in spirit\nMMIWG\nPremier Rachel Notley\nRacism\nSisters in Spirit\nTurtle Island\nWalking with Our Sisters\nPrevious article\nFirst Degree Homicide Charges Laid in Justin Duncan Death\nNext article\nORC Archibald \u2013 \u201cWe keep the MMIWG2ST in our hearts\u201d\nAmanda Perreault\nhttp://www.netnewsledger.com\nNetNewsledger.com or NNL offers news, information, opinions and positive ideas for Thunder Bay, Ontario, Northwestern Ontario and the world.

Canadian Press\n\nA VIA Rail sign at the train station in Halifax. , (THE CANADIAN PRESS/Andrew Vaughan)\n\nVANCOUVER -- Via Rail has joined discussions with the British Columbia government, First Nations and social service agencies to offer rock-bottom fares to \"vulnerable\" people who can't afford to travel along the so-called Highway of Tears.\n\nThe railway is collaborating with mayors and multiple groups to determine the criteria for $5 fares along a northern B.C. corridor where 18 girls and women have been murdered or have disappeared since the 1970s.\n\nIn June, following a decade of pleas from women's groups and First Nations, B.C. Transportation Minister Todd Stone announced that bus service would begin in the area by the end of the year.\n\nChief Joseph Bevan of the Kitselas First Nation near Terrace said he's part of an advisory group concerned about the safety of people along the 750-kilometre route and that it came together for regular meetings last November after months of discussions.\n\nHe said it's common for people to take a risk and hitchhike in the notorious area because they're too poor to take the train or a Greyhound bus.\n\n\"It's non-aboriginals as well. It's everyone who is on social assistance, people with disabilities, who are having trouble moving around. It makes them vulnerable when they're jumping into a vehicle with somebody else.\"\n\nBevan said that at a meeting in March, a Via Rail official made the proposal to offer a $5 fare along the highway that stretches between Prince Rupert and Prince George.\n\nMichael Woelcke, the railway's general manager for remote services, said in minutes of the meeting held in Prince George on March 30 that the company would offer the low fare \"regardless of origin or destination along the route.\"\n\nHe said Via Rail provides train service three times a week between Prince Rupert and Prince George, and it's open to suggestions on determining eligibility for the $5 fare that would be available to \"at risk\" and \"vulnerable\" people including youth and \"elders.\"\n\n\"We need to identify who would qualify for this program, as we cannot provide everyone with these reduced fares,\" he said in the minutes.\n\nWoelcke said a minimum $75 one-way fare would be reduced by a third for aboriginal passengers.\n\nWoelcke was not available for comment, and the company said an official would provide details if and when an arrangement is worked out with the province.\n\nVia Rail said in an emailed statement that a discounted fare for \"vulnerable\" people is one of the options being studied and that discussions with the Transportation Ministry and the advisory group are ongoing.\n\nThe ministry said interconnectivity of services along Highway 16 has been part of discussions and that Via Rail was included to determine what role it could play to increase transportation options.\n\n\"We continue to engage with Via Rail on the idea of offering a discounted train fare to vulnerable First Nations people,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe group is slated to meet again next month.\n\nAs for the promised new bus service between Prince George and Prince Rupert, the ministry said the first of more than 20 public information sessions hosted by BC Transit will start Saturday.\n\nBC Transit said Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, which is part of the advisory group, has provided $1 million in funding for features including enhanced bus stop shelters and CCTV cameras to ensure passengers' safety along the corridor.\n\nThe route provides the main transportation link to and from remote First Nations villages located off the main highway.\n\nMost of the cases of murdered and missing women remain unsolved, but police have said it's believed that more than one killer is involved.\n\n \nTop Picks\n6:00\n \n\nKeith Richards' Top Picks: July 4, 2024\n\n5:27\n \n\nCole Kachur's Top Picks: July 3, 2024\n\n6:28\n \n\nDavid Driscoll's Top Picks: July 2, 2024\n\nSubscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Accessibility Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ\n\u00a9 2024All Rights Reserved\nCTV News Sites"},

She\u2019s suggested calling the system the \u201cRed Dress Alert.\u201d Now, the federal government is starting to consult civil groups about making the alert a reality.\n\n\u201cEvery day that we don\u2019t have a red dress alert, Indigenous women, girls, diverse-gendered folks and two-spirit people go missing,\u201d Gazan said. \u201cThere are not currently systems in place to properly protect or search for loved ones who do go missing. So it\u2019s urgent, and it needs to be put in place.\u201d\n\nThe rate of homicide against Indigenous women and girls is about six times higher than non-Indigenous women and girls, according to Statistics Canada. In March, the federal budget included funding for an alert system to help find missing Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse people. Not long after, Ottawa recognized the crisis as a national emergency.\n\nThis month, the federal government started discussions with front-line workers, community organizations and families of Indigenous people who have gone missing.\n\nKarine Duhamel, former director of research for the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, said she\u2019s happy to see the alert moving forward.\n\n\u201c[The alert] strongly asserts that these lives matter and that Indigenous women and girls, two-spirit and transgender people have a right to safety,\u201d Duhamel said.\n\nThe federal system should also consider how an alert system serves people fleeing unsafe circumstances, aging out of care, or moving to a different community, she added.\n\n\u201cIt might not be kind of a one-size-fits-all approach,\u201d Duhamel said. \u201cThe engagements and consultations that are part of this project need to reflect the very broad diversity of folks who may be kind of included in such an alert system.\u201d\n\nIn Canada, Amber Alerts for missing children are delivered through the Alert Ready system, which sends messages to television, radio and cell-service devices. At present, Amber Alerts are issued by police services in Canada.\n\nBut there are other ways to deliver the alert, said Jennifer Jesty. As emergency resilience manager for the Union of Nova Scotia Mi\u2019kmaq and a member of the Eskasoni First Nation, Jesty worked with software company Everbridge to create the Unama\u2019ki Emergency Alert System.\n\nThe system now serves five Mi\u2019kmaq nations and has sent out alerts about dangerous individuals, extreme weather and missing persons. Since its inception in September 2020, the Unama\u2019ki Emergency Alert System has issued more than 150 alerts. According to Jesty, in 96 per cent of missing person alerts, the person was reunited with family in less than an hour. The service could help find missing Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse people across Canada, she said.\n\n\u201cWhy reinvent the wheel? What we have going on over here at Unama\u2019ki has been wildly successful,\u201d Jesty said.\n\nJesty, a chief or community leader can send emergency alerts over text, email or landline so they reach people out of cell service range.

(Galen Simmons/The Beacon Herald)\nArticle content\n\nIn line with the national movement, local women\u2019s groups, the Stratford chapter of Amnesty International, and members of local Indigenous communities will hold a day-long Sisters in Spirit event Thursday, honouring missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nBeginning with a sunrise smudging ceremony and the lighting of a sacred fire at 7:15 a.m. in Market Square, the event will see more than 20 local businesses and organizations displaying red dresses throughout the day to raise awareness of the cause.\n\nInspired by the REDress Project by M\u00e9tis artist Jaime Black, the dresses symbolize the absence of over 1,000 Indigenous women across Canada. Information on the red dresses downtown will invite the public to attend a vigil that will begin in Market Square at 7 p.m.\n\nDuring the vigil, Patsy Day and Winona Sands, both Indigenous women, will speak to the cause.\n\nDay, of the Turtle Clan, Oneida Nation, is a teacher who was orphaned at the age of six as a result of the assimilation policies in the federal government\u2019s Indian Act. Having reconnected with her family as an adult, Day regained her native status and now teaches people of all ages about Indigenous people in Canada.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nSands, a member of the Bkejwanong Band on the Walpole Island First Nations Reserve on Lake Erie, is the community chef at the Local Community Food Centre in Stratford. Sands, who has been cooking for most of her life, has also worked as an addictions counsellor, social worker, and support worker for Indigenous women and children, and as a women\u2019s advocate at the Atlohsa Native Family Healing Centre in London.\n\n\u201cAs the Native Women\u2019s Association emphasizes, this is a national tragedy \u2014 the disproportionate violence that Indigenous women and girls face and the disproportionate risk of murder,\u201d said Anne Carbert, a volunteer with the Stratford chapter of Amnesty International, one of a few groups working to orchestrate Thursday\u2019s event.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cThis is something that the national inquiry is looking into currently, and our governments are needing to figure out how to respond. I think bringing awareness to that, paying attention to that process, showing support for families that are suffering\u2026 is very important.\u201d\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, Indigenous women and girls in Canada are at least three times more likely to experience violence, and at least six times more likely to be murdered than any other woman or girl in Canada.\n\nThe Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada (NWAC) has\nworked for more than four decades to document the systemic violence impacting Indigenous women, girls, their families, and communities.\n\nThe association is a lead organizer of the Sisters In Spirit Vigils, a national movement that encourages concerned citizens and\nIndigenous community members to gather on October 4th.\n\nFor more information on the Sisters in Spirit Vigils, visit\u00a0www.nwac.ca/home/policy-areas/violence-prevention-and-safety/sisters-in-spirit/october-4th-vigils/.\n\nTo learn more about the Stratford vigil, visit the event\u2019s Facebook page at\u00a0www.facebook.com/events/519166718495072/.\n\ngsimmons@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\nLATEST NATIONAL STORIES\nNEWS NEAR STRATFORD\nTHIS WEEK IN FLYERS"},

The empty red dresses and scarves served as a symbol of lost lives, raising awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People. SUBMITTED jpg, TN\nArticle content\n\nCanada\u2019s House of Commons unanimously backed a motion on earlier this month declaring the deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls a national emergency.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe May 2 motion also called for funding a new system to alert the public when someone goes missing.\n\nOn Friday, May 5, red dresses were displayed across the country to recognize National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People. Known as Red Dress Day, the empty garments served as a symbol of lost lives.\n\nIn Tillsonburg, the Ingersoll and Area Indigenous Solidarity & Awareness Network hosted its first two-hour Honouring MMIWG2S+ event on May 6, displaying red dresses and scarves at Participark. They chose Saturday evening to avoid scheduling conflicts with healing ceremonies or pre-established marches.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure Oxford (County) was doing something to recognize it because we do have an Indigenous presence here, it\u2019s just not as noticeable because we don\u2019t feel as accepted,\u201d said Patricia Marshal, director of Ingersoll & Area\u2019s Indigenous Solidarity and Awareness Network (IISAN). \u201cWe\u2019re trying to change that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nMarshal said IISAN, organizers of Oxford\u2019s annual March for Truth and Reconciliation in Ingersoll, is taking steps toward that goal. There are specific issues they feel Canadians, and specifically people in Oxford County, have the power to do something about. They are the Every Child Matters Movement, reconciliation for residential schools and \u201cjust being there for survivors and making sure that we\u2019re moving forward taking into account the genocide that has been experienced,\u201d Marshal said.\n\nThe second is Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People, \u201csomething that has been going on since the establishment of what we now know as North America. And it\u2019s still going on to this day.\u201d\n\nThe third issue is lack of basic resources in Indigenous communities, and encouraging people to write their MPs and MPPs. \u201cWe all have that power at any time about any of these issues,\u201d Marshal said.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cSome of the women that were at Participark shared about how when they were little, there were friends that just went missing \u2013 and nobody knew where they went,\u201d said Tillsonburg Councillor Kelly Spencer, who attended the event with her mother. \u201cThe number is quite staggering \u2013 and that\u2019s only the number that is reported\u2026. This is the harsh reality for Indigenous women and girls.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of a wakeup call,\u201d said Spencer. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre to me that we don\u2019t talk about this.\u201d\n\nIISAN\u2019s Honouring MMIWG2S+ event, co-organized by Marhsal and Lisa Scott, had been planned since last November. They started asking for red dress donations in January, and purchased more dresses at Salvation Army to reach their goal of 50.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to have at least one dress (or scarf) that could represent at least 10 years of the 500 years that we\u2019ve been dealing with this, to kind of give a visual impact. It\u2019s a spiritual thing to use red dresses because it\u2019s a colour the spirits can see, to show them that we still love them, where home is and where their loved ones are.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe event was respectful and introspective, said Marshal, and full of facts to help people understand why MMIWG2S+ is a national issue.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand why this is a problem, even when we put out stats like 10,000 Indigenous people go missing every year and 8,000 of those are children. It\u2019s truly heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nMarshal said the goal is to improve awareness for IISAN\u2019s annual event and improve the attendance. About 10 people participated in their first Honouring MMIWG2S+ and they want more next year. Dozens more. Hundreds more.\n\n\u201cThe inspiration to do it on the Trans Canada Trail was that it connects all of Canada and this issue connects coast to coast.\u201d\n\nIISAN is aiming to host events in each of the three main urban centres in Oxford County, which means Woodstock is on the radar to launch a future event. Follow the IISAN Facebook page to learn more.\n\n\u201cIISAN has been trying very hard to make sure we are doing what we can in our community to help make sure people understand what has happened, what is happening, and what they can do to help solve it.\u201d\n\nThe next March for Truth and Reconciliation in Ingersoll is Sept. 30, 2023. IISAN will also be at the June 17 Oxford Family Pride Day event in Woodstock.\n\n\u2013 With files from Kelly Geraldine Malone, Canadian Press\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\nLATEST NATIONAL STORIES\nNEWS NEAR SIMCOE\nTHIS WEEK IN FLYERS"},

And, sure, the St. Augustine and Ponte Vedra Beach area can offer you typical Florida fun with its nearly 70 kilometres of sugar sand shores, but, wow, does it have so much more to offer.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nHistory and hauntings (if you believe in such things, just about everywhere in the city is home to the ghosts of the long dead) are first on the menu in this glorious little city, which quickly rose to the top of my list of places in Florida I must spend more time in. A quick, three-day visit isn\u2019t nearly enough time to explore the old-world charm of St. Augustine, first made famous by Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de Leon and his discovery of the mythical Fountain of Youth nearly 500 years ago and later put on the map by industrialist Henry Flagler.\n\nThe world-famous Fountain of Youth, discovered by Spaniard Ponce de Leon. (Dave Pollard/Toronto Sun) PHOTO BY DAVE POLLARD /Toronto Sun\n\nOnce you\u2019ve hit the ground in St. Augustine, the best way to get a lay of the land is to take a tour aboard the Old Town Trolley, which stops at many of the area\u2019s most famous attractions, including the 17th-century Castillo de San Marcos, the Fountain of Youth Park, the Old Jail and the colonial quarter. It\u2019s a 90-minute narrated round trip but your ticket is good for the day and allows you to hop on and off at whatever stops you like.\n\nTravel Time\n\nPlan your next getaway with Travel Time, featuring travel deals, destinations and gear.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nBeing a history buff, my first stop on the trolley tour was at the Castillo, a massive fortification that once protected the city\u2019s coastline from invaders and the oldest masonry structure of its kind in the U.S. It\u2019s fascinating wandering around the star-shaped fort, poking my nose into every nook and cranny, while imagining what has gone on inside its historic coquina walls over the centuries.\n\nFlagler College in St. Augustine, once the site of Henry Flagler\u2019s Ponce de Leon Hotel. (Dave Pollard/Toronto Sun)\n\nNext up was a stop at Ponce de Leon\u2019s Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park, a 15-acre site that commemorates the Spaniard\u2019s exploration of the area in 1513 and subsequent discovery of a natural fresh-water spring. Located alongside the Matanzas River and St. Augustine Inlet, the park is home not only to the famous spring, which you can drink from, but also a recreation of a Timucuan village that was home to the area\u2019s Indigenous people, and historical actors who depict life from when the city was settled.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nTry to time it right to see the cannon firing but it\u2019s also cool to see a talk about the period arquebus gun and its firing along with crossbow demonstrations. Or just wander through the stately oaks and cedars, breathing in history, while walking alongside the many peacocks on site.\n\nI stopped to see the Old Jail in daylight but the real fun here happened after dark on the guided Ghosts and Gravestones Tour aboard the \u2018Trolley of the Doomed,\u2019 which has been dubbed St. Augustine\u2019s premier \u2018Frightseeing Tour.\u2019\n\nAn actor portrays a condemned prisoner under the gallows at St. Augustine\u2019s Old Jail. (Dave Pollard/Toronto Sun)\n\nThe host and other actors involved in the tour were dressed in period costumes, which enhanced the experience and made it a ton of fun. At the Old Jail, an actor dressed as a condemned man took our group through the cell block after making a, ahem, dramatic entrance and finished up at the outdoor gallows.\n\nAdvertisement 6\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nEarlier in the day, I boarded the Victory III, part of the St. Augustine Scenic Cruise fleet, for a cruise around the Matanzas River and out towards the city\u2019s legendary lighthouse. Seeing the Castillo from the water made it more imposing and getting a photo of the lighthouse (did I mention it\u2019s haunted?) from the boat made it a worthwhile trip.\n\nCannons point to sea at the Castillo San Marcos in St. Augustine, Fla. (Dave Pollard/Toronto Sun)\n\nOther things you might want to see in St. Augustine are the Ximenez Fatio House that depicts life in the 18th century, and picturesque Aviles Street plus St. Augustine Distillery, an option for adult readers who enjoy artisanal spirits.\n\nOne last stop was at Flagler College for a tour of the school that was once Henry Flagler\u2019s luxurious Ponce de Leon Hotel. The college offers guided tours that explore the history of the campus dating back to the golden days of the Ponce hotel.\n\nAdvertisement 7\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for some varied dining options, try Columbia Restaurant in the city\u2019s historic district, a local favourite that serves Cuban-Spanish influenced dishes, the Cordova Coastal Chophouse in the Casa Monica Hotel, and Meehan\u2019s Irish Pub and Seafood House, another busy place that is a bit more casual.\n\nHistoric, and reportedly haunted, St. Francis Inn in St. Augustine, Fla. (Dave Pollard/Toronto Sun)\n\nAMELIA ISLAND\n\nHeading out of St. Augustine, I drove the A1A Scenic and Historic Coastal Byway and stress seeped away the closer I got to Amelia Island for a relaxing two-night stay. Just a 90-minute drive, the coastal route gave me a chance to check out the seaside dunes and smaller towns like Ponte Vedra Beach (headquarters of the PGA Tour) and Sawgrass, home of the famous TPC Sawgrass golf course that hosts The Players Championship annually.\n\nAdvertisement 8\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nAfter the bustling tourist town of St. Augustine, my stay on Amelia Island was like a breath of relaxing air. If you\u2019re looking for a laid-back vacation in sunny Florida, where you can clear your head and avoid the massive crowds, Amelia Island is a perfect choice.\n\nCenter Street is the main drag in Fernandina Beach, Fla. (Dave Pollard/Toronto Sun)\n\nFernandina Beach is the island\u2019s main town and, in many ways, showcases the old Florida lifestyle as a Victorian seaport village. It\u2019s a snapshot of small-town Florida, with a tree-lined main drag filled with boutique shops and other places \u2014 like, for instance, the Palace Saloon, reputedly Florida\u2019s oldest bar \u2014 to poke around while decompressing.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always that way though. Fernandina Beach was once home to pirates, bootleggers and other, uh, colourful characters as well as Gilded Age millionaires and shrimpers looking to get rich. Now, though, the town is much quieter.\n\nAdvertisement 9\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nA walk through Amelia Island State Park will enhance the chill vibe of the area. Stroll along the beach and look for shark\u2019s teeth and shells, try to spot the wildlife and explore the salt marshes and coastal forests for a \u2018Real Florida\u2019 experience. Heck, you can even wet a line on the George Crady Bridge Fishing Pier and take advantage of the amazing fishing conditions.\n\nA U.S. Navy submarine sails past Fort Clinch State Park on Amelia Island, Fla. en route to a sea deployment. (Dave Pollard/Toronto Sun)\n\nOr if you want to dip your toe back into the historical aspect of the island, visit Fort Clinch State Park. The park is home to Fort Clinch, one of the best-preserved 19th-century forts in the U.S. It might even give you a classic wow-that\u2019s-cool photo moment like I had, when an American submarine and its entourage sailed up the Cumberland Sound past Fort Clinch on its way to a sea deployment from King\u2019s Bay sub base.\n\nAdvertisement 10\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nI got to explore Cumberland Sound myself during a 75-minute trip with Amelia River Cruise. Highlights were getting the chance to see Georgia\u2019s Cumberland Island, a 28-km island that is home to some 200 wild horses that can often be seen roaming the beaches, many types of birds, and the remains of Dungeness Mansion, once owned by the Carnegie family. Your cruise guide will even point out the copper-roofed house used in The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking, a 1988 film based on the character created by a Swedish author.\n\nFort Clinch is seen from the water during a cruise around Cumberland Sound on Amelia Island, Fla. (Dave Pollard/Toronto Sun)\n\nI wound down even further with a drink while enjoying a half-hour session of miniature bowling, a variation of Canadian five-pin bowling, at Duck Pinz Fernandina. It was fun but would have been even better with a group of friends.\n\nAdvertisement 11\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThere were plenty of dining options in the Amelia Island area. If you\u2019re looking for a higher-end restaurant with fine dining, try POGO\u2019s Kitchen, which got a four-star review from the New York Times. Simpler fare can be found at Salt Life Food Shack near the entrance to Fort Clinch State Park, a casual beachside eatery, and the Salty Pelican, a personal fave (I ate there twice!) in downtown Fernandina Beach.\n\nAfter saying my farewells to fantastic Fernandina Beach, I hopped in the car for a short 45-minute drive to Jacksonville airport and my flight home.\n\nMiniature bowling, a variation of Canadian five-pin bowling, at Duck Pinz Fernandina. (Dave Pollard/Toronto Sun)\n\nWHERE TO STAY IN ST. AUGUSTINE\n\n\nI spent two nights at the St. Francis Inn, a quiet bed and breakfast in the heart of the city\u2019s historic district that is within easy walking distance of many restaurants, museums, antique shops and steps from other tourist attractions, including the Gonzalez-Alvarez House, billed as the oldest (1723) surviving house in St. Augustine and now open as a museum.\n\nAdvertisement 12\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe Inn itself dates back more than 230 years \u2014 it was built in 1791 \u2014 but has all the modern comforts despite its sometimes quirky (and did I mention haunted?) interior. I stayed in the Ballerina Room and, fortunately, did not get a visit from any apparitions.\n\nSt. Francis Inn is a member of Select Registry, a distinguished group of luxury inns across North America, and well worth booking for your visit.\n\nThe Salty Pelican is a popular spot with locals and tourists in Fernandina Beach, Fla. (Dave Pollard/Toronto Sun)\n\nWHERE TO STAY ON AMELIA ISLAND\n\nMy beachside condo at the Amelia Surf and Racquet Club, which was provided by Coastal Wave Properties, offered the perfect base of operations. I\u2019d highly recommend it for anyone, but particularly families due to the secure location, multiple bedrooms, full kitchen and laundry, and many amenities, including an outdoor pool and beach. You might even see some endangered beach turtles hatching!\n\nHOW TO GET HERE\n\nAir Canada offers non-stop flights from Toronto Pearson to Jacksonville, which is a one-hour drive from St. Augustine and slightly less from Amelia Island. You\u2019ll obviously need to rent a car if you decide to fly. But driving to the area isn\u2019t a bad idea, either, being one of the closer Florida destinations for anyone from Ontario.\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nStop Buying Lottery Tickets & Start Doing This Instead!\nYukon\n|\nSponsored\nClick Here\nCops hunt for suspect after child sexually assaulted\nWinnipeg Sun\nManitoba RCMP shoot and kill man who was allegedly assaulting a woman\nWinnipeg Sun\nCasinos Hate You Doing This.

The department also said it was a day to honour the families, loved ones and communities of those women.\n\n\u201c[We\u2019re] continuing our search for Belinda in our effort to help her family find answers,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nThe police are asking anyone with information about the missing Esquimalt woman to come forward and share what they know.\n\nCameron was 42 when she last seen in 2005 at the Esquimalt\u2019s Shoppers Drug Mart in the 800-block of Esquimalt Road.\n\nShe was reported missing nearly a month later. Despite an extensive investigation and a series of searches, she was never found.\n\nThe police consider the disappearance suspicious and presume Cameron was the victim of foul play. Her disappearance continues to be investigated as a homicide.\n\nAt the time, Cameron stood five-foot-eight with a medium to large build, and weighed about 170 pounds. She had dark brown eyes and long, dark brown hair that she wore parted in the middle. She wore silver-framed glasses.\n\nCameron\u2019s daughters are now adults and want to understand their mother\u2019s disappearance.\n\nPolice ask anyone with information about this case to contact VicPD\u2019s historical case review office at 250-995-7390 or Greater Victoria Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.\n\naduffy@timescolonist.com\n\nSee a typo/mistake?\nHave a story/tip?\nThis has been shared 42 times\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nMore Local News\n\tNanaimo RCMP find illicit drugs, weapons after stopping suspected prohibited driver\n\tPolice seize 20 guns, 20,000 rounds of ammo in raid on Bear Mountain home\n\tMLA Rob Fleming says he won't run in fall provincial election\nTimes Colonist - Featured\nInjuries reported in Highway 4 crashes on Canada Day weekend\nRead More\nTRENDING TODAY\n6292\t\nFirst heat wave of the summer on the way to Vancouver Island and B.C.\n\n2633\t\nFairway grocery store closing at Westshore Town Centre\n\n2569\t\nSuspect's pants catch fire in arson attempt gone wrong: B.C.

On this day, we remember the people who have lost their lives to colonial, gender-based violence and their families and communities that live daily with the grief of losing loved ones.\u201d\n\nMohawks noted that a final federal inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women was released in June 2019.\n\n\u201cThere were 2,836 individuals who participated in the truth-gathering process and 231 calls to justice were recommended. To date, there has been little action on the calls for justice,\u201d said the MBQ.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nLocal politicians attended the vigil to lend their support for more action.\n\nTodd Smith, Bay of Quinte MPP, spoke at the gathering and noted online, the vigil was \u201cto honour missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and to continue to advocate for systemic change and a future where everybody feels safe in their communities.\u201d\n\nRic Bresee, MPP for Hastings-Lennox and Addington, said he attended the vigil to stand \u201cwith my federal, provincial, municipal, and First Nations colleagues for the #RedDressDay walk and ceremony in Belleville. When someone loses their mother, daughter, or sister, we grieve. But when a whole community loses their girls and women, we all grieve.\u201d\n\nBoth MPPs were joined by Ryan Williams, Bay of Quinte MP, at the event.\n\nAccording to Amnesty.ca, a 2021 report by the RCMP found, \u201c1,017 women and girls identified as Indigenous were murdered between 1980 and 2012\u2014a homicide rate roughly 4.5 times higher than that of all other women in Canada.\u201d\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\nLATEST NATIONAL STORIES\nNEWS NEAR PICTON\nTHIS WEEK IN FLYERS"},

But one homeowner in the Lake Tahoe area has discovered just how resourceful some bears can be when their curiosity is piqued at snack time.\n\nThe video below, uploaded to YouTube by the media juggernaut named ViralHog, shows a couple of bears sniffing around a Ram 1500 and Jeep Grand Cherokee. In short order, one of the bruins stands on its hind legs and easily uses its two front paws to manipulate the exterior door handles of both vehicles, opening the doors and jumping inside for a sniff.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nAnd we all laughed in Jurassic Park when the raptors opened that door to the kitchen.\n\nJokes aside, your author has stashed food inside an unlocked vehicle whilst camping, a task he will no longer undertake without thumbing the \u2018lock\u2019 button on its keyfob. We all know not to store food or waste in the open bed of a pickup truck, for reasons ably demonstrated by the bear standing in the pan of this Ram 1500, but most logical people would think a closed and latched vehicle door would be enough deterrent to keep curious bears away from tasty consumables. As we see here, it is most certainly not sufficient.\n\nRECOMMENDED FROM EDITORIAL\nTwo men injured in grizzly bear encounters in Alberta's south\nBears awaken early this spring, sightings on the rise in parts of Metro Vancouver\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen this type of activity from bears, of course.

In 1994 alone, three teenage girls were killed along this route.\nCB\nBy chantelle bellrichard\nOctober 16, 2015, 11:30am\nShare\nTweet\nSnap\nIMAGE VIA VICE CANADA\n\nThe red flowers have worn off.\n\nFootage shared on Telegram shows floral tributes to Russian opposition leader, and outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin, Alexei Navalny, being removed by authorities in Yekaterinburg.\n\nStill, seven stones are embedded in the dreamcatcher hanging in the back window of Brenda Wilson's car. In the center is a high school photo of her little sister Ramona trimmed into a circle. Long dark hair pulled to one side. A familiar blue backdrop. It's the Gitxsan teen's last school photo.\n\n\"I just always keep it with me,\" said Brenda. \"It was actually on my sister's casket when she was buried.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRamona was just 16 when she disappeared. It was the summer of 1994. Somehow, she never made it to the graduation parties she was going to that night. Ten months went by before her body was found in a wooded area near the local airport. For 21 years Ramona's family has been advocating for her, but her murder remains unsolved.\n\nJustice is difficult to find on the 450 mile stretch of Highway 16 that winds through central British Columbia, connecting Prince Rupert and Prince George. In 1994 alone, three teenage girls were killed along this route: Ramona Wilson, Roxanne Thiara, and Alishia Germaine. No one was ever charged.\n\nThis is the Highway of Tears.\n\nFamilies and communities have walked the highway's entire length, and then some, demanding justice. Brenda says Ramona's dreamcatcher is in her car for an upcoming walk.\n\n\"We don't want people to forget who she was as an individual person.\"\n\nBRENDA WILSON SAYS THE STONES IN THE DREAMCATCHER REPRESENT RAMONA, HER SIBLINGS AND MOTHER/VICE CANADA\n\nA Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)\u00a0report released in 2014 revealed that British Columbia had the highest number of unsolved cases of murdered and missing indigenous women and girls in the country: 76.\n\nMany of those disappearances and deaths occurred around the highway.\n\nThe numbers have changed, but the RCMP's latest report doesn't give a provincial breakdown.\n\nIn the absence of convictions, families are often the ones serving time. Organizing vigils, walks and rallies, contributing to conferences, research and prevention programs. They're leading calls to stop the violence, demanding the government support them in holding a national inquiry.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA collective grief is echoing across the country, as the toll climbs. According to the RCMP,\u00a01,107 Aboriginal women were murdered and another 164 went missing between the years 1980 and 2012.\n\nRelated:\u00a0Harper Rejects Call For Inquiry Into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women\u00a0\n\n\"You are in Highway of Tears Country,\" is the headline on a pocket-sized flyer at the Carrier Sekani Family Services office in Prince George. It's not actually clear how many women and girls are unaccounted for in the region.\n\nMore than 30, says the flyer. More than 40, suggests a Human Rights Watch report.\n\nToo many.\n\nThe Family Services office is located in Prince George, the province's so-called gateway to the north. Brenda Wilson works there under the title Highway of Tears Initiative Coordinator. Part of her job involves visiting communities along the highway, hosting workshops, and supporting victim's families.\n\n\"You know, I accept the fact that my sister is no longer here on this Earth,\" said Brenda.\u00a0\"But I also accept the fact that I am here, not to take her place, but I'm here as her voice. To let people know what happened to her and to bring awareness to the issues.\"\n\nConcrete solutions are out there; they've been on the books for nearly a decade.\n\nWatch the VICE Canada documentary, Searchers: Highway of Tears, here:\u00a0\n\n\"I think it's very, very, very slow,\" Mary Teegee says about the implementation of 33 recommendations to come out of the Highway of Tears Symposium that followed the death of 14-year-old Aielah Saric Auger. She was dumped on the side of the highway just west of Prince George in the winter of 2006.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTeegee is an executive director at Carrier Sekani Family Services and was also Ramona Wilson's cousin. She runs through some of the work they've been able to accomplish. But, she says government funding is an ongoing issue.\n\n\"We've always maintained that work regardless of the funding because it's something that we believe in. It's something that our communities want us to do. But it's very difficult when there isn't the resources to keep going,\" said Teegee.\n\nBy the time the Highway of Tears Symposium launched, an RCMP task force called E-PANA had been put together to investigate whether a serial killer (or killers) was responsible for the deaths and disappearances along the highway. E-PANA's caseload would eventually double to 18 cases and was expanded to include other highways in the province.\n\nBreakthroughs have come in a few cases. Still, most of the Highway of Tears cases remain unsolved.\n\nAielah Auger's murder was the last, and most recent case added to the E-PANA task force.\n\nLike so many families, her mom became an outspoken advocate for missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.\u00a0\"Justice is what I want,\" Audrey Auger was quoted as saying in 2006.\n\nShe\u00a0died on the same highway, in a car accident in 2013.\u00a0Aielah's murder is still unsolved.\n\nClaudia Williams has been waiting for someone to solve her sister's murder since 1989.\n\n\"It goes through my mind every day,\" she says, recounting her last moments with her younger sister Alberta. It was a summer night. The sisters had been working in a cannery in Prince Rupert.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPayday came and they decided to go to a cabaret with a group of friends.\n\nAfter the place closed Claudia says people were milling about trying to figure out where to go next. Claudia got caught up in a conversation with her boyfriend - and says Alberta, 24, was calling for her: 'Claudia! Claudia! Come on, we're going to a party!'\n\n\"I looked at her and said, 'Just a minute.'\"\n\nMoments later Alberta was gone. A month later her body was found. And 26 years later, no one has been charged. Her contact with the police is virtually non existent. Shortly after speaking to VICE News, the RCMP phoned her for the first time in years. (The RCMP declined to be interviewed for this story.)\n\nMuch of Claudia's faith is placed in a former cop\u00a0faith is placed in a former cop, Ray Michalko, who has been investigating a number of Highway of Tears cases for years. He's studied the victims, traversed hundreds of miles, rummaged through the bush, and run down leads, all on his own time and seemingly at his own expense.\n\n\"People are going missing. Kids are going missing. Women are going missing. It doesn't matter who they are or what their race is or anything,\" he said. \"It shouldn't matter. Especially in Canada. But, you know, there's a lot of people who'd tell you it does.\"\n\n**\n\nWhen you get to the second floor of the Carrier Sekani Family Services office there's a piece of art on the wall. Tears fall from a woman's face onto the silhouette of a person below.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I think that in general our communities have a lot of grief. We have a lot of grief and we have a lot of healing to do.\"\n\nMary Teegee isn't just talking about the women and girls that are gone.\n\nShe's talking about things like colonization, residential schools and loss of land. Things that have undoubtedly contributed to the disproportionate number of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada.\n\n\"I think that's why when we look at something like the [Highway of Tears] recommendations report, there's 33 recommendations, and it's just one step in for us to get to that place where you know, our communities are getting stronger.\"\n\nRamona Wilson's family has spent 21 years keeping her story alive - more years than Ramona got to live on this Earth.\n\nBrenda Wilson has made it her job to protect those who are still living.\n\n\"You know it's really painful to every day to talk about your loved one, but you know it has to be done,\" Brenda said.\n\n\"What motivates me and what keeps me going \u2026 to do interviews, to do presentations\u2026 I want my sister's murder to be solved and also, I want there to be safety in our communities.\"\n\nFollow Chantelle Bellrichard on Twitter: @pieglue\n\nWatch another segment in VICE Canada's Searchers series, Misty Potts, here:\u00a0\n\nTAGGED:\nABORIGINALAIELAH AUGERBRITISH COLUMBIACANADACRIME & DRUGSMISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMENMMIWRAY MICHALKORCMPROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICEVICE NEWS\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE VICE NEWSLETTER.\nYour Email:\nSubscribe\nMORE\nLIKE THIS\nNews\nThe Very Best of VICE News Reporting\nVICE STAFF\n04.30.24\nNews\nInside the Christian Nationalist Church Where Proud Boys Go to be Baptized\nTESS OWEN\n02.22.24\nNews\nWhat We Know About the Death of Nonbinary Teen Nex Benedict\nTESS OWEN\n02.21.24\nNews\nFBI Investigating an Insular, Nameless Religious Group Undergoing Sexual Abuse Reckoning\nANNA MERLAN\n02.21.24\nNews\nRussian Pilot Who Stole Helicopter to Defect Found Shot to Death in Spain\nMITCHELL PROTHERO\n02.20.24\n0\nMORE\nFROM VICE\nNews\nWhere's Navalny's Body?\n\nAlexei Navalny's mother is still being denied access to her son's body after Vladimir Putin's foremost critic died under suspicious circumstances in a Russian prison on Friday.\n\nMITCHELL PROTHERO\n02.19.24\nNews\nMan Who Showed Father\u2019s Decapitated Head in a YouTube Video Charged With Terrorism\n\nPolice say that when they arrested Justin Mohn they found a USB drive with a folder that indicated he wanted to blow up Federal Buildings.\n\nMACK LAMOUREUX\n02.16.24\nNews\nPutin Critic Alexei Navalny Dies in Russian Prison\n\nAlexei Navalny died on Friday in one of Russia's toughest prisons.

Most cases remain unsolved, though investigators don't believe a single killer is responsible.\n\nThe sorrow deepened recently with a damning report over deleted Transportation Ministry emails about the highway and its missing.\n\nTransportation Minister Todd Stone has said he agrees with the opinions of some locals that a shuttle bus service along the route isn't practical.

The last anybody heard from the family was when Ronald called a family member from a Prince George pub to say he and his wife found jobs.\n\n\"They just simply disappeared. Mom, dad and the two boys,\" Leween said.\n\nShe said successive B.C. governments have refused to move on First Nations' requests to provide a regional transportation network. Leween described government consultations attempts as sophisticated stalling tactics.\n\n\"I, as a leader, don't feel the government is doing enough to addresses the issue,\" she said.\n\nLeween rejected Stone's claim that leaders across the north agree a large-scale transit service won't work.\n\n\"It's absolutely untrue,\" she said. \"The bus is desperately needed in our area.

Its route is dark, lonely and blood stained.\n\n\u201cWithin (our) community, we have had an entire family that went missing, the Jack family,\u201d said Leween. \u201cOne of our elders is missing.\u201d\n\nCasimel Jack, 70, was last seen a decade ago, walking along a road that connects to Highway 16 south of Burns Lake. He was hunting and carrying a rifle when he disappeared Sept. 18, 2005.\n\nRonald Jack, his wife, Doreen, and their two sons, Russell, 9, and Ryan, 4, vanished Aug. 1, 1989. The last anybody heard from the family was when Ronald called a family member from a Prince George pub to say he and his wife found jobs.\n\n\u201cThey just simply disappeared. Mom, dad and the two boys,\u201d Leween said.\n\nShe said successive B.C. governments have refused to move on First Nations\u2019 requests to provide a regional transportation network. Leween described government consultations attempts as sophisticated stalling tactics.\n\n\u201cI, as a leader, don\u2019t feel the government is doing enough to addresses the issue,\u201d she said.\n\nLeween rejected Stone\u2019s claim that leaders across the north agree a large-scale transit service won\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely untrue,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bus is desperately needed in our area. I go to Prince George quite often to meetings and I see the young women hitchhiking on that highway. It\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\nStone said the government is looking to develop shorter transportation connections between communities, but a region-wide transportation service is not workable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for many folks to comprehend, myself included, how a scheduled shuttle bus service across an 800 kilometre stretch of highway that\u2019s very sparsely populated would meet the needs of people who live along the highway.\u201d\n\nStone said his ministry is holding a transportation symposium in Smithers Nov. 24 to discuss practical, affordable and sustainable solutions for communities along Highway 16.\n\nOpposition New Democrat Jennifer Rice, whose North Coast riding includes a section of Highway 16, said she has not been invited to the symposium but plans to attend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here (in Victoria) two years, and I\u2019ve been asking this question numerous times around improving the transportation and safety along Highway 16, and I\u2019ve been shrugged off and told basically to move on and get a new idea,\u201d she said.\n\nRice said two years ago when she accidentally locked herself out of her car on a stretch of the highway she felt the chill of being alone in the middle of nowhere.\n\n\u201cI was in a pull out, and I had no cell service and I was the only one there,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI had just come back from Victoria and I had been asking questions about the Highway of Tears.

However, the Opposition New Democrats say recently released documents contradict Stone and highlight the concerns of local officials who say a bus service should be considered.\n\nThe controversy could be swept up in a call by the federal Liberal government for an inquiry into Canada's murdered and missing women.

The federal and British Columbia governments in partnership with Rogers Communications say a 15-year-old pledge to provide seamless cellular coverage along a remote B.C. highway will be fulfilled by October 2022. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick\n\nThe federal and British Columbia governments say seamless cellular coverage will be provided along the Highway of Tears by October 2022.\n\nSeventy per cent of Highway 16 already has some coverage, but Lisa Beare, B.C.'s minister of citizens' services, says the $11.7-million project will bring cell service to the remaining 252 kilometres between Smithers and Prince Rupert.\n\nThe project is set to begin this spring and will add 12 cell towers as well as improve connectivity at three rest stops, with the province and Ottawa each contributing just over $2 million and Rogers Communications picking up the remainder of the bill.\n\nHighway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert became known as the Highway of Tears more than two decades ago, a reference to the many Indigenous women who have gone missing or been murdered along the route since the 1970s.\n\nIn a separate announcement, the B.C. government says nearly $5 million in cell service upgrades is coming to Highway 14 on Vancouver Island between Sooke and Port Renfrew, with work expected to be complete by late October.\n\nThe Highway 14 improvements will bring cell service to Port Renfrew, Shirley, Otter Point, Jordan River and some Pacheedaht First Nation communities.\n\nMaryam Monsef, the federal minister for women and gender equality and rural economic development, says the Highway 16 upgrade marks a milestone for Aboriginal communities.\n\nShe told an online news conference it is the first universal broadband cell project being funded that will \"primarily benefit Indigenous communities, but it will not be the last.\"\n\nBoth Beare and Monsef said better cell service makes everyone safer.\n\n\"Knowing that people will be able to travel Highway 16 without worrying about gaps in coverage is exactly the kind of result we want to see on every community highway and in every rural and Indigenous community,\" Beare said.\n\nThe Highway of Tears Symposium Report made 33 recommendations in 2006, including solving the problem of cellular gaps between the handful of communities along the 725-kilometre corridor.\n\nRCMP files link a total of 18 murders or disappearances to the region, but Carrier Sekani Family Services in Prince George says on its website that the number likely exceeds 40.\n\nBack to Homepage\n\nTypos\nNews Tips\nForums\n\nMUST-READ STORIES\n\nGet all the day's most vital news with our newsletter, sent every weekday.\n\n\n\nMore BC News\n\n\n\nBC\nVancouver Webcam\nWebcam provided by windy.com\nRECENT STORIES\nAmbushed in failed hit job\nKamloops - 1:46 pm\nHeat warnings issued\nBC Coast - 1:43 pm\nLife in prison for murder\nAbbotsford - 1:39 pm\nA parade of aches and pains\nCalgary - 1:27 pm\nPower restored in Aberdeen\nKamloops - 1:16 pm\nMore Top Stories >\nBC Quick Links\nBC Discussion Forum\nGovernment of BC\nBC Wildfire Service\nProvincial Emergency Program\nHealthLink BC\nDrive BC\nBC Ferries\n\n\n\n\nVanessa Hudgens gives birth\nShowbiz | July 04, 2024\nBaseball playing pup\nMust Watch | July 04, 2024\nMischievous Beagle caught tearing up the toilet paper\nMust Watch | July 04, 2024\nVintage bathrooms\nGalleries | July 04, 2024\nEmma Roberts finds love again\nShowbiz | July 04, 2024\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 Castanet.net Make Castanet Your Homepage News Tips Advertising Contact Us"},

Greyhound Canada has applied to regulators in British Columbia to drop five routes, four of them in northern B.C., as the company deals with plunging ridership.\nImage Credit: THE CANADIAN PRESS/John Woods\nAugust 31, 2017 - 8:45 PM\n\nVANCOUVER - Greyhound Canada has applied to regulators in British Columbia to drop five routes, four of them in northern B.C., as the company deals with plunging ridership.\n\nGreyhound calls the decision \"regrettably unavoidable\" but said there has been a 51 per cent drop in riders since 2010, along with higher costs and increased competition from publicly subsidized services.\n\nRoutes that would be eliminated include a 718-kilometre run along Highway 16, the so-called Highway of Tears, between Prince George and Prince Rupert.\n\nAfter dozens of murders and disappearances of women along that highway, the province, local governments and BC Transit launched a subsidized route in June connecting Burns Lake, Prince George and Smithers, mirroring portions of the Greyhound route.\n\nThe company has also applied to drop its routes from Prince George to Valemount, Prince George to Dawson Creek, Dawson Creek to Whitehorse and Victoria to Nanaimo.\n\nStuart Kendrick, senior vice-president at Greyhound, said the application was filed with the Passenger Transportation Board earlier this month and the process normally takes about 90 days but could be longer because of the proposal to cut five routes.\n\n\"We can't continue to operate these routes at a loss,\" he said, adding Greyhound can't compete with subsidized BC Transit.\n\n\"We've communicated to the provincial government for several years that this is eroding our business. It does create an unfair playing field and when you have subsidized transit they're able to offer fares that are much lower than ours,\" Kendrick said.\n\n\"Connectivity from northern B.C. into the main corridors is really what the customer needs and right now it's not a viable option for a private carrier.\"\n\nGreyhound is continuing its discussions with provincial and federal officials regarding viable options for transportation in rural areas, Kendrick said.\n\nTerry Teegee, tribal chief of the Prince George-based Carrier Sekani First Nation, said other private companies also would be unlikely make a profit for the same reasons but rural residents need reliable transportation between communities that are geographically spread out.\n\nHe said existing subsidized services would have to be expanded or new ones would be needed to take over so people in northern B.C. have options that are readily available elsewhere in the province.\n\n\"Why aren't we a priority?\" he asked. \"There's no reason why there couldn't be a transit system up here as well that could (provide) service like in Vancouver, or any other place.\"\n\nFirst Nations leaders, mayors and advocates pushed the province for a decade to fund transportation along Highway 16.\n\nThe B.C. government finally came up with a transportation plan last year, but only after a 2012 report from a missing women inquiry that had commissioner Wally Oppal recommending bus service along the corridor where people often hitchhike to get around.\n\nService is being rolled out separately in various communities and started in January with a 30-minute, six-days-a-week shuttle along a small section of the highway, from Moricetown and Smithers.\n\nThe Passenger Transportation Board could call public consultations as part of its decision process on Greyhound's application.\n\nNote to readers: This is a corrected story. A previous version said the passenger transportation branch would decide whether to eliminate the routes.\n\nNews from \u00a9 The Canadian Press, 2017\n\n\nMore News ...\niN RESPONSE: Readers have their say\nFollowing are emailed reader responses to stories or letters to...\nChefs mourn for Okanagan's peaches but adapt to stone fruit wipeout\nKelowna woman loses legal fight with housing co-op over medical cannabis\nFrom no strata fees to discounted golf, Okanagan developers using promos to sell homes\nPopular Kamloops News\nOkanagan contractors fined $19,000 for unsafe building sites\nJuly 02, 2024 6:00 PM\nKamloops homeless day services set to close with no promised replacement\nJuly 03, 2024 6:00 AM\nKelowna breeder wins after being sued over sick Labradoodle\nJuly 03, 2024 7:00 AM\nVernon cabinetmaker ordered to pay $2,500 for shoddy work\nJuly 01, 2024 6:00 AM\n'Merchants of death': Lengthy sentence for Vernon fentanyl dealer\nJuly 01, 2024 6:00 PM\nTop News\nKamloops police investigating targeted gangland shooting\niNwheels\nJuly 04, 2024 1:05 PM\nNo more lengthy delays in Highway 97 rock slide zone near Summerland\niNwheels\nJuly 04, 2024 11:55 AM\nHow to stay cool at work during southern Interior heat wave\nJuly 04, 2024 10:50 AM\nChefs mourn for Okanagan's peaches but adapt to stone fruit wipeout\niNwine\nJuly 04, 2024 9:41 AM\nMan broke into Kelowna construction site, climbed crane\nJuly 04, 2024 7:37 AM\nTrending Now\nTRENDING NOW: Stormtrooper party balloon chaos\nKamloops\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nKamloops Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nKelowna\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nKelowna Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nPenticton\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nPenticton Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nVernon\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nVernon Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\n\u00a9 2024 InfoTel News Ltd\nContact iNFOTEL MULTIMEDIA |\u00a0\nContact iNFOnews |\u00a0\nSubmit News Tips |\u00a0\nPrivacy Policy & Disclaimer |\u00a0\nSitemap |\u00a0\nNewsletter Signup\nView Site in: Desktop | Mobile"},

PHOTO BY JONATHAN HAYWARD /THE CANADIAN PRESS\nArticle content\n\nVICTORIA \u2014 The small British Columbia Cheslatta Carrier Nation has a decades-long anguished relationship with Highway 16, or the so-called Highway of Tears.\n\nFive people from the community of less than 350 near Burns Lake in central B.C. have disappeared along the route, including an entire family of four, says Chief Corrina Leween.\n\nAt least 18 women went missing or were murdered along Highway 16 and the adjacent Highways 97 and 5 since the 1970s. Most cases remain unsolved, though investigators don\u2019t believe a single killer is responsible.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nTRENDING\n'You just can't snap your fingers and move out Evander Kane': Edmonton Oilers insider\nSecret weapon helps Edmonton Oilers convince top players to sign and stay here\nInjured woman dies in deep southeast Edmonton, man arrested: Police\nOilers Stanley Cup playoff run nets $280M for Edmonton: OEG, Explore Edmonton\nThursday's letters: Edmonton must end its urban sprawl\nArticle content\n\nThe sorrow deepened recently with a damning report over deleted Transportation Ministry emails about the highway and its missing.\n\nTransportation Minister Todd Stone has insisted that locals don\u2019t want a bus service, but recently released documents highlight the concerns of local officials and contradict the minister.\n\nThe controversy could be swept up in a call by the federal Liberal government for an inquiry into Canada\u2019s murdered and missing women. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised the inquiry during the election campaign.\n\n\u201cI would expect that because a number of women have gone missing, and or have been known to have been murdered along Highway 16, that Highway 16 will figure in the national inquiry,\u201d said Stone. \u201cOur government has been on the record for quite some time in supporting a national inquiry.\u201d\n\nB.C.\u2019s Attorney General Suzanne Anton said she also expects an inquiry would focus on the highway.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to second-guess the federal inquiry, but there probably will be an aspect about the north all across the country,\u201d she said.\n\nAn RCMP report last year stated nearly 1,200 aboriginal women were murdered or went missing between 1980 and 2012.\n\nHeadline News\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nHighway 16 stretches more than 700 kilometres between Prince George and Prince Rupert. It follows rivers and mountains and connects remote communities. Its route is dark, lonely and blood stained.\n\n\u201cWithin (our) community, we have had an entire family that went missing, the Jack family,\u201d said Leween. \u201cOne of our elders is missing.\u201d\n\nCasimel Jack, 70, was last seen a decade ago, walking along a road that connects to Highway 16 south of Burns Lake. He was hunting and carrying a rifle when he disappeared Sept. 18, 2005.\n\nRonald Jack, his wife, Doreen, and their two sons, Russell, 9, and Ryan, 4, vanished Aug. 1, 1989. The last anybody heard from the family was when Ronald called a family member from a Prince George pub to say he and his wife found jobs.\n\n\u201cThey just simply disappeared. Mom, dad and the two boys,\u201d Leween said.\n\nShe said successive B.C. governments have refused to move on First Nations\u2019 requests to provide a regional transportation network. Leween described government consultations attempts as sophisticated stalling tactics.\n\n\u201cI, as a leader, don\u2019t feel the government is doing enough to addresses the issue,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nLeween rejected Stone\u2019s claim that leaders across the north agree a large-scale transit service won\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely untrue,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bus is desperately needed in our area. I go to Prince George quite often to meetings and I see the young women hitchhiking on that highway. It\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\nStone said the government is looking to develop shorter transportation connections between communities, but a region-wide transportation service is not workable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for many folks to comprehend, myself included, how a scheduled shuttle bus service across an 800 kilometre stretch of highway that\u2019s very sparsely populated would meet the needs of people who live along the highway.\u201d\n\nStone said his ministry is holding a transportation symposium in Smithers Nov. 24 to discuss practical, affordable and sustainable solutions for communities along Highway 16.\n\nOpposition New Democrat Jennifer Rice, whose North Coast riding includes a section of Highway 16, said she has not been invited to the symposium but plans to attend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here (in Victoria) two years, and I\u2019ve been asking this question numerous times around improving the transportation and safety along Highway 16, and I\u2019ve been shrugged off and told basically to move on and get a new idea,\u201d she said.\n\nRice said two years ago when she accidentally locked herself out of her car on a stretch of the highway she felt the chill of being alone in the middle of nowhere.\n\n\u201cI was in a pull out, and I had no cell service and I was the only one there,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI had just come back from Victoria and I had been asking questions about the Highway of Tears.

The hearings will be powerful, she said.\n\n\u201cI feel it since I arrived, there\u2019s a lot of emotion, lots of anxiety also or stress, because it\u2019s the first time for them,\u201d she said. \u201cJust being there beside them and listening, maybe it\u2019s helped.\u201d\n\nThe inquiry has been plagued by controversy, including the resignation of commissioner Marilyn Poitras this summer and complaints from families about poor communications and delays.\n\nBuller told a Senate committee last week that the inquiry\u2019s work has been hampered by federal bureaucracy.\n\nRhonda Lee McIsaac, who lives in Haida Gwaii and has Ojibway heritage, participated in the walk for the first time and said it was a moving experience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m walking for everybody who cannot walk,\u201d said McIsaac. \u201cI have lost a loved one. I grew up in foster care and I was adopted out. This is part of my story.\u201d\n\nMore than 40 people have signed up to speak at the Smithers hearings, which run through Thursday. They are the second hearings held by the inquiry after it visited Whitehorse in May.\n\nThe inquiry is set to visit nine communities this fall, including Edmonton, Winnipeg and Thunder Bay, Ont.\n\n\u2014 Follow @ellekane on Twitter.\n\nSubmit a Correction\nAccessibility Feedback\nLive Radio\nConnect with CityNews\nTrending Now\n1 dead, 2 others injured in crash on eastbound Gardiner\nFirst GST/HST credit payment from 2023 tax returns set to arrive July 5\nToronto daycare rolls back staff wage raises, blames Ontario's funding model\nTorontonians can now toss their used coffee cups in the blue bin\nThe 680 NewsRadio Toronto Weather Guarantee\u2122\nTop Stories\nLCBO, union still 'very far apart' as Friday strike looms\n\n1h ago\n\nTorontonians can now toss their used coffee cups in the blue bin\n\n21m ago\n\nThe Spadina Sprint: A CityNews experiment\n\n4h ago\n\nWeekend need-to-know: Summerlicious begins and salsa takes over St. Clair\n\n1h ago\n\nMost Watched Today\n3:28\nUnion, province remain far apart in LCBO negotiations\n\nWith less than 24 hours away from a possible strike at LCBO stores across Ontario, the union says they are still far from reaching a deal in negotiations with\u00a0the province.

He was concerned about how a freedom of information request was handled. He hand-signed the letter in blue pen.\n\nEmails had been deleted, instead of being reported, Tim Duncan alleged.\n\nIt turns out that request was related to missing women and government meetings about Highway 16. More specifically, the 450-mile stretch of Highway 16 that connects Prince George to Prince Rupert -\u2014 commonly referred to as the Highway of Tears. People who live in the region will tell you more than 30 women and girls, mostly indigenous, have gone missing or been murdered there.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe information request that came through Tim Duncan's department ultimately resulted in \"no responsive records.\" But Duncan says when he searched his computer, there were over a dozen emails that could have been relevant.\n\nHe says he called over a coworker, a man named George Gretes, to report the emails. And then, Duncan alleges Gretes took control of his computer, deleted the emails, and said:\n\n\"It's done, now you don't have to worry about it anymore.\"\n\nAfter months of investigation, BC Privacy Commissioner Elizabeth Denham released her findings this week in a report titled Access Denied: Records Retention and Disposal Practices of the Government of British Columbia.\n\n\"It is difficult to overstate the seriousness of the problems that my office discovered in the course of this investigation and the resulting effect on the integrity of the access to information process in our province,\" Denham wrote.\n\nRecommendations have been made and now the RCMP has been asked to step in after Gretes \"failed to tell the truth,\" under oath, about deleting\u00a0Highway of Tears emails.\u00a0Gretes has disputed Duncan's version of what happened, but the truth-telling part goes beyond who hit delete on that one particular day.\n\nThe Access Denied report goes into detail about how government staff have been expunging email records through a three-step process of deletion that includes manually overriding\u00a0a backup that can recover deleted files.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVariations of the term \"triple delete\" appear 58 times in Denham's report. There are actually three freedom of information requests reviewed in the investigation and they all involve emails and record keeping/destruction in some way.\n\nRelated:\u00a0Life and Death Along Canada's Highway of Tears\n\nResponding to the report yesterday, BC Premier Christy Clark called for government ministries and political staff to stop deleting their sent emails and also committed to making the changes recommended in Denham's report.\n\n\"For me, the most important thing is the public has an expectation that their government is transparent and we're going to make sure that we act on all those recommendations, so it is,\" said Clark.\n\nBrenda Wilson has been watching the week's events unfold from Prince George, where she lives and works as the Highway of Tears Initiative Coordinator. Brenda's sister Ramona was found murdered along the highway in 1995. No one has been charged in her death.\n\n\"To me as a family member it just shows why a lot of the things that were promised in the past have not been fulfilled,\" she said.\n\n\"When they can't find a solution they just push it under the rug. It's not important enough for them to try to make it work.\"\n\nOne of the solutions communities along the Highway of Tears have been demanding, for years, is better transportation along the route with a shuttle bus.\n\nIt was the number one recommendation made in the 2006 Highway of Tears Symposium Recommendations Report and is seen as a way to prevent women and girls from being victimized.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe freedom of information request detailed in Tim Duncan's complaint and Denham's subsequent report is directly connected to this issue. The request was written as follows:\n\n\"Pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, I request all government records that make reference to the issue of missing women along Highway 16/the Highway of Tears and specifically including records related to meetings held by the ministry on this issue. The time frame for my request is May 15 to November 19, 2014.\"\n\nLast summer the ministry did meet with communities and First Nations leaders along the route to discuss transportation challenges and possible solutions.\n\nAccording to the report, It seems the \"no responsive records\" result came down to the ministry interpretation of the request - making a distinction that the meetings were about transportation options, not missing women.\n\n\"I don't know how they could say that when that's what it all evolved around, the missing women,\" said Wilson, who is also an advocate for missing and murdered women.\n\n\"That's why the whole transportation issue came about was because of the missing women along Highway 16. I don't know how they could say stuff like that when it's not the truth.\"\n\nDenham was also critical about how the ministry interpreted the request and that it appeared the ministry \"fully understood\" what meetings the applicant was referring to.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWilson says she'll be watching to see how the government and RCMP handle the situation moving forward.\n\n\"I hope that there's accountability for the actions that happened. You know, that they rectify the issue so that we can go on to mend our thoughts of a good government, a clean government that we can count on,\" she said.\n\n\"All we want is to be able to work together and to keep our communities safe\u00a0\u2026 We just want to keep everybody safe.\"\n\nFollow Chantelle Bellrichard on Twitter:\u00a0@pieglue\n\nWatch the VICE Canada documentary, Searchers: Highway of Tears, here:\u00a0\n\nTAGGED:\nBC PRIVACY COMMISSIONERBRITISH COLUMBIACANADACHRISTY CLARKELIZABETH DENHAMGEORGE GRETESHIGHWAY OF TEARSINDIGENOUSMISSING AND MURDERED ABORIGINAL WOMENPOLITICSTRIPLE DELETEVICE NEWS\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE VICE NEWSLETTER.\nYour Email:\nSubscribe\nMORE\nLIKE THIS\nNews\nThe Very Best of VICE News Reporting\nVICE STAFF\n04.30.24\nNews\nInside the Christian Nationalist Church Where Proud Boys Go to be Baptized\nTESS OWEN\n02.22.24\nNews\nWhat We Know About the Death of Nonbinary Teen Nex Benedict\nTESS OWEN\n02.21.24\nNews\nFBI Investigating an Insular, Nameless Religious Group Undergoing Sexual Abuse Reckoning\nANNA MERLAN\n02.21.24\nNews\nRussian Pilot Who Stole Helicopter to Defect Found Shot to Death in Spain\nMITCHELL PROTHERO\n02.20.24\n0\nMORE\nFROM VICE\nNews\nWhere's Navalny's Body?\n\nAlexei Navalny's mother is still being denied access to her son's body after Vladimir Putin's foremost critic died under suspicious circumstances in a Russian prison on Friday.\n\nMITCHELL PROTHERO\n02.19.24\nNews\nMan Who Showed Father\u2019s Decapitated Head in a YouTube Video Charged With Terrorism\n\nPolice say that when they arrested Justin Mohn they found a USB drive with a folder that indicated he wanted to blow up Federal Buildings.\n\nMACK LAMOUREUX\n02.16.24\nNews\nPutin Critic Alexei Navalny Dies in Russian Prison\n\nAlexei Navalny died on Friday in one of Russia's toughest prisons.

Some information may no longer be current.\n\nA sign warning that a killer is at work along the Highway of Tears stands in Moricetown, B.C., March 20, 2011.\nRAFAL GERSZAK/THE GLOBE AND MAIL\n\nCOMMENTS\nSHARE\n\nVia Rail has joined discussions with the British Columbia government, First Nations and social service agencies to offer rock-bottom fares to \"vulnerable\" people who can't afford to travel along the so-called Highway of Tears. The railway is collaborating with mayors and multiple groups to determine the criteria for $5 fares along a northern B.C. corridor where 18 girls and women have been murdered or have disappeared since the 1970s.\n\nIn June, following a decade of pleas from women's groups and First Nations, B.C. Transportation Minister Todd Stone announced that bus service would begin in the area by the end of the year.\n\nRelated: Disappeared: Reconstructing a life to find a missing mother\n\nChief Joseph Bevan of the Kitselas First Nation near Terrace said he's part of an advisory group concerned about the safety of people along the 750-kilometre route and that it came together for regular meetings last November after months of discussions.\n\nHe said it's common for people to take a risk and hitchhike in the notorious area because they're too poor to take the train or a Greyhound bus.\n\n\"It's non-aboriginals as well. It's everyone who is on social assistance, people with disabilities, who are having trouble moving around. It makes them vulnerable when they're jumping into a vehicle with somebody else.\"\n\nBevan said that at a meeting in March, a Via Rail official made the proposal to offer a $5 fare along the highway that stretches between Prince Rupert and Prince George.\n\nMichael Woelcke, the railway's general manager for remote services, said in minutes of the meeting held in Prince George on March 30 that the company would offer the low fare \"regardless of origin or destination along the route.\"\n\nHe said Via Rail provides train service three times a week between Prince Rupert and Prince George, and it's open to suggestions on determining eligibility for the $5 fare that would be available to \"at risk\" and \"vulnerable\" people including youth and \"elders.\"\n\n\"We need to identify who would qualify for this program, as we cannot provide everyone with these reduced fares,\" he said in the minutes.\n\nWoelcke said a minimum $75 one-way fare would be reduced by a third for aboriginal passengers.\n\nWoelcke was not available for comment, and the company said an official would provide details if and when an arrangement is worked out with the province.\n\nVia Rail said in an emailed statement that a discounted fare for \"vulnerable\" people is one of the options being studied and that discussions with the Transportation Ministry and the advisory group are ongoing.\n\nThe ministry said interconnectivity of services along Highway 16 has been part of discussions and that Via Rail was included to determine what role it could play to increase transportation options.\n\n\"We continue to engage with Via Rail on the idea of offering a discounted train fare to vulnerable First Nations people,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe group is slated to meet again next month.\n\nAs for the promised new bus service between Prince George and Prince Rupert, the ministry said the first of more than 20 public information sessions hosted by BC Transit will start Saturday.\n\nBC Transit said Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, which is part of the advisory group, has provided $1 million in funding for features including enhanced bus stop shelters and CCTV cameras to ensure passengers' safety along the corridor.\n\nThe route provides the main transportation link to and from remote First Nations villages located off the main highway.\n\nMost of the cases of murdered and missing women remain unsolved, but police have said it's believed that more than one killer is involved.\n\nSign up for the B.C.

It is the same highway where her beloved niece Tamara Lynn Chipman disappeared.\n\nOutside a community centre in Smithers, B.C., her voice shook as she spoke to those who had walked alongside her, including commissioners from the national inquiry into missing and murdered women.\n\n\u201cI want to thank you all for standing so proud and loud, to show our commissioners that we have love for our missing and murdered women,\u201d she said through tears.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud of this moment right now because when Tamara went missing, nobody cared. When Tamara went missing, there were many others who were already missing, many others who had been murdered.\u201d\n\nDozens of women have disappeared or been killed along the highway between Prince Rupert and Prince George in central B.C.\n\nRadek and other family members and advocates left Prince Rupert on Thursday and arrived Monday in Smithers, where the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls will hold hearings starting Tuesday.\n\nThe walkers were accompanied by vehicles and have covered sections of the route in a relay fashion, allowing them to complete the walk of hundreds of kilometres over the span of a few days.\n\nDuring the final stretch through the town of Smithers, Radek, who is missing a leg, drove a car covered in photographs of women who have disappeared or been killed. She wept behind the wheel as passersby waved and honked their horns.\n\nInquiry commissioner Michele Audette joined the group three days ago, while Chief Commissioner Marion Buller joined on Monday. Commissioner Qajaq Robinson was supposed to attend the hearings but had to bow out due to a family emergency.\n\nAudette said she walked to honour the resilience and strength of the families who will be speaking for the first time to the inquiry. The hearings will be powerful, she said.\n\n\u201cI feel it since I arrived, there\u2019s a lot of emotion, lots of anxiety also or stress, because it\u2019s the first time for them,\u201d she said. \u201cJust being there beside them and listening, maybe it\u2019s helped.\u201d\n\nThe inquiry has been plagued by controversy, including the resignation of commissioner Marilyn Poitras this summer and complaints from families about poor communications and delays.\n\nBuller told a Senate committee last week that the inquiry\u2019s work has been hampered by federal bureaucracy.\n\nRhonda Lee McIsaac, who lives in Haida Gwaii and has Ojibway heritage, participated in the walk for the first time and said it was a moving experience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m walking for everybody who cannot walk,\u201d said McIsaac. \u201cI have lost a loved one.

The route also provides the main transportation link to and from remote First Nations villages located off the main highway.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\nA list of the victims along B.C.\u2019s Highway of Tears\n\nMost cases of murdered and missing women remain unsolved, though investigators don\u2019t believe a single killer is responsible.\n\nThe daily email you need for Edmonton's top news stories.\n\nTransportation Minister Todd Stone says agreements between 16 communities along the highway will allow B.C. Transit to operate a scheduled bus service between Prince George and Prince Rupert.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, this initiative is all about safety,\u201d he said.\n\nMORE ON BC\n2 prominent B.C.

Transit must still develop service schedules and provide extra buses for the route.\n\nStone said plans for the Highway 16 area also include offering bus driver training programs for First Nations to provide transportation service from their remote villages to other major communities along the highway.\n\nChief Corrina Leween of the Cheslatta Carrier Nation said the bus service helps many living in towns on or near the highway, but it offers little comfort to those off the main road.\n\nREAD MORE:\u00a0B.C. commits $3 million to improve safety along Highway of Tears\n\n\u201cThe work they are doing for the core group on the corridor is good, but for us it really doesn\u2019t work because we\u2019re off the beaten trail,\u201d she said.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\nLeween said the main Cheslatta community of about 300 people is located about 25 kilometres south of Burns Lake and getting to the highway requires a ferry trip and travel on a dirt road.\n\nFive Cheslatta people, including a family of four and a male elder, have disappeared from the area over the years, she said.\n\nNew Democrat Maurine Karagianis, the Opposition\u2019s critic for women, said area residents and local politicians have called for improved transportation services for years, but the government has been stalling while many people hitchhike for rides with strangers.\n\n\u201cI say get on with it,\u201d she said.\n\nFirst Nations advocate Mary Teegee said a decade ago, dozens of people walked from Prince Rupert to Prince George to call for better transportation service along the highway.\n\n\u201cIt has been 10 years since of the Highway of Tears recommendations report came out and we are finally making progress,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI view transportation as a human rights issue in the north and we are working toward making sure everyone has access.\u201d\n\nJOURNALISTIC STANDARDS\nCOMMENT\nREPORT AN ERROR\n\u00a9 2016 The Canadian Press\nSponsored content\nMore to Explore\nADVERTISEMENT\n630 CHED Afternoons with Bryn Griffiths & Reid Wilkins\n2:00 PM - 5:00 PM\n630CHED\nTrending\nGreece is bringing in a 6-day work week.

Authorities believe a serial killer\u2014or serial killers\u2014has been at work in an isolated part of British Columbia since 1969. Since then, dozens of women have disappeared or been murdered by unknown killers stalking victims along the highway.\n\nA 450-mile stretch of road between Prince George and Prince Rupert along Highway 16 is known as the \u201cHighway of Tears\u201d because of the high number of women who have disappeared or been murdered along the road. The highway cuts through rural logging towns and impoverished Native American\u00a0reservations with vast swaths of wilderness in between. Many of the missing and murdered women along the Highway of Tears are indigenous.\n\nThe Royal Mounted Canadian Police has a special unit dedicated to the area, and it has linked 18 cases along the highway from 1969 to 2006. But local indigenous leaders estimate that up to 50 girls and women have been murdered or have gone missing along the Highway of Tears.\n\nThe indigenous people living around the Highway of Tears believe the killings never received the attention they deserved because of the low socioeconomic and social standing of native peoples within Canadian society.\n\nRelated: A Walk in the Woods: 7 of the World\u2019s Most Haunted Forests and Woodlands\u00a0\n\nPhoto Credit: Wikimedia Commons\n\nWant more unsolved cases?

Carolyn Bennett, the minister of indigenous and northern affairs, says that the families of the murdered and missing women believe that the police treat their loved ones\u2019 deaths \u201cas inevitable, as if their lives mattered less.\u201d\n\nRelated: 20 Unsolved Murders That Will Send Shivers Down Your Spine\u00a0\n\nBritish Columbia\u2019s government plans to improve safety along Highway 16 by installing safety cameras and giving indigenous communities funding for vehicles. Right now the remote communities along Highway 16 have very little lighting on the road, and the only public transportation available is infrequent Greyhound buses.\n\nIn October, CBC Radio One\u2019s The Current released a virtual reality documentary called Highway of Tears. The documentary focuses on the case of Ramona Wilson, a 16-year-old girl from Smithers, British Columbia, who disappeared on her way to a nearby town in 1994. Wilson\u2019s body was found the following year, but, like many others along Highway 16, her murder remains unsolved.\n\nRelated: Creepy Drive: 6 Haunted Roads from Around the World\n\nTo this day, police are confounded at their lack of progress in catching the serial killer\u2014or killers\u2014who has left this path of destruction along Highway 16. A staff sergeant in the Royal Mounted Canadian Police recently told the CBC that many of the killings may never be solved: \u201cThat\u2019s the reality, and that\u2019s what I tell the families.\u201d\n\nPolice have keyed in on several suspects, including a deceased American rapist and murderer named Bobby Jack Fowler, and they have actually charged serial killer Cody Legebokoff with one of the murders, but the overwhelming majority of the killings along Highway 16 remain a mystery.\n\nRelated: 6 Scary Serial Killers Who Were Never Caught and May Still Be on the Loose\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFeatured photo: Wikimedia Commons\n\nThis story was first published on did you know?\n\nRead More:\n\nAmelia Earhart May Not Have Died in a Plane Crash After All\n\nThe Real Life Inspiration for Pigman in American Horror Story: Roanoke\n\n12 of the Coolest Things People Found with Metal Detectors\n\ndid you know?\nMysterious Death\nUnsolved Crimes\nDisappearances\n\n\n\n\nGet our eeriest tales and best book deals delivered straight to your inbox.\nSubscribe\nYes!

(Jonathan Hayward / The Canadian Press)\n\nSHARE:\nReddit\n\n\n\n\nVICTORIA -- Enhanced transit routes, expanded driver-training programs and more roadside webcams make up the core of a multimillion-dollar plan aimed at improving safety along a stretch of British Columbia highway renowned for missing and murdered women.\n\nB.C.'s Transport Minister Todd Stone announced a long-awaited $3-million strategy for the so-called Highway of Tears on Monday, saying delays in government action were the result of extensive consultation with local stakeholders.\n\n\"I would have liked to have been making this announcement many, many, many months ago, but we needed to go through this rigorous process of engagement and discussion,\" said Stone. \"Today is about transitioning from the discussion to action.\"\n\nRelated Stories\nB.C. community leaders meet to discuss safety on notorious Highway of Tears\nDocuments on Highway of Tears open wounds as missing-women inquiry looms\nB.C. transportation minister says changes coming to Highway of Tears\n\nEighteen women, many of them aboriginal, have disappeared or been murdered along Highway 16 or adjacent routes since the 1970s. The infamous 750-kilometre span of road meanders through an isolated region of B.C.'s Interior, between Prince Rupert and Prince George.\n\nStone's announcement comes shortly after the federal government went public with plans to launch a national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women. Many who have called for the inquiry have highlighted the tragic history of the Highway of Tears.\n\nAn RCMP report stated last year nearly 1,200 aboriginal women were murdered or went missing across Canada between 1980 and 2012.\n\nMonday's announcement in B.C. committed $1.6 million over two years on a cost-sharing basis with communities to extend pre-existing transit along Highway 16.\n\nAn additional $750,000 over three years will go towards helping communities buy and operate transit vehicles, as well as $150,000 over three years to increase the number of licensed drivers in First Nations communities.\n\nThe province earmarked a final $500,000 in infrastructure funding over two years to install more transit shelters and highway webcams.\n\n\"In addition to enhancing the actual transportation options that people have in the corridor, we want people to also know that we have an eye on safety as well,\" said Stone.\n\nOverseeing the program's implementation is an advisory panel, made up of representatives from the province, local governments, health authorities and First Nations.\n\nBurns Lake Mayor Luke Strimbold, who is part of the advisory group, said the $3-million funding announcement marks historic progress in improving safety along Highway 16.\n\n\"Our communities now have a framework we can work towards to implement transportation solutions,\" said Strimbold.\n\nFirst Nations Health Authority spokesman Richard Jock is also on the board and shared Strimbold's optimism. He emphasized the opportunity to improve access to health care for people living in remote communities.\n\n\"We're looking forward to working in particular with our northern health partners to see how this can really be part of effective transportation response in the North,\" he said.\n\nSmithers Mayor Taylor Bachrach spoke positively about the government's plan, but at the same time raised concerns.\n\n\"The key question is whether the amount of resources that are being put on the table are going to be adequate to fix the problem,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not sure that $1.6 million over two years is going to provide affordable, accessible transportation for all of the small communities in our region. The problem is somewhat larger.\"\n\nNew Democrat member of the legislature and northern health critic Jennifer Rice questioned if the plan's cost-sharing approach would be financially feasible for all northern communities.\n\n\"Families of murdered and missing women have been waiting for some action for well over a decade,\" she said.\n\n\"But having some money put towards improving transportation in the North is positive.\"\n\nStone said the government will have a better idea about how the funding will be distributed after the advisory panel meets with local groups and reports back to him by early March.\n\nSHARE:\nReddit\nReport an error\nEditorial standards and\u00a0policies\nWhy you can trust CTV\u00a0News\nREAD MORE POLITICS NEWS\nMontreal MP, Jewish group condemn antisemitic poster telling him to 'get out of Canada'\nDeputy prime minister says 'vast, vast majority' of Liberal caucus supports Trudeau\nConservatives paid $8.5M on advertising in 2023, trouncing Liberals, NDP\nStreaming services challenge Canadian rules on revenue-sharing for news\nSask. files injunction in light of federal carbon tax dispute\nNewfoundland and Labrador premier takes aim at Ottawa over reopened cod fishery\nWATCH MORE POLITICS STORIES\nfalse\nCTV National News: What would make PM step aside?\nfalse\nCTV National News: Trouble for Trudeau?\nfalse\nPower Play: Plays and misplays\nfalse\nPower Play: Panel discusses PM's future\nfalse\nCTV National News: Growing calls to step down\nfalse\nTrend Line: New data from Nik Nanos\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSubscribe to our election alerts.

It spans 450 miles between the small cities of Prince George in the province\u2019s interior and Prince Rupert on the Pacific coast. Over the past 40 years, more than 40 women mysteriously disappeared or died from foul play in that area. Most of their circumstances remain unknown. The road\u2019s geographically known as #16 or the Yellowhead Route but\u2014for good reason\u2014locals call it the Highway of Tears.\nThe Highway of Tears murders and the women\u2019s suspicious disappearances began in 1969. They continue today with the last case of modus operandi (MO) similarities happening in December 2018. Although police officially remain cautious about confirming links, many in-the-know suspect there may be many more crimes with victims fitting the mold.\n\nIn 2005, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) formed a task force called E-Pana to look at the area\u2019s unsolved missing and murdered women cases. The RCMP is Canada\u2019s federal force having jurisdiction across the nation and in the region. The task force initially identified 18 cases but soon expanded their investigation to include similar files eastward along Route 16 to Hinton, Alberta as well as south along Highway 97 to Kamloops, BC and along Highway 5 from Merritt to Clearwater.\n\nTwo significant independent government inquiries or investigations into the Highway of Tears and related matters also happened. One was a British Columbia Provincial Symposium held in 2006. The other\u2014a recent, national commission called the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Inquiry. It\u2019s called that because many victims were of indigenous or First Nations ethnicity.\n\nDespite the massive police and public effort, no one\u2019s been caught for most of the crimes. As well, many of the victim\u2019s bodies remain hidden and undiscovered. That leaves people wondering if there\u2019s a serial killer loose on the Highway of Tears.\n\nThe Highway of Tears Victims\n\nWithout exception, every victim in the Highway of Tears (HOT) sphere is female. That includes confirmed murders as well as unsolved disappearances. Another harsh fact is many victims originated from aboriginal or First Nations backgrounds. It\u2019s a reality that can\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nProject E-Pana (named so after the Inuit spirit that guides souls to the afterlife) used four criteria to qualify a murder or suspicious disappearance as a Highway of Tears or HOT case. These parameters were sound and valid, as many homicide and missing persons cases in the north have other circumstances that don\u2019t suggest a commonality the HOT files have. Out of great precaution, HOT investigators are very careful about using the \u201cSK-word\u201d\u2014Serial Killer. To be on the HOT list, the E-Pana victim profiles are:\n\nFemale\nHigh-risk lifestyle\nKnown to hitchhike\nFound or last seen near Highways 16, 97 & 5\n\nFemales who hitchhike and practice a high-risk lifestyle around this remote road network are easy prey. Many come from physical, sexual and substance abusive backgrounds. Many are sex workers and drug users as well as having alcoholic tendencies and serious mental/emotional disorders. And, many women victims are from indigenous communities with a host of social problems.\n\nPolice investigators feel most, if not all, Highway of Tears cases are stranger-to-stranger relationships. Police don\u2019t like the serial killer term because of public ramifications, but it\u2019s a classic serial killer pattern to pick up strangers and have their way. Most lone-operating killers leave little evidence behind at their crime scenes, take little with them, make sure there are no independent witnesses and they rarely confess. That combination makes these predators so hard to catch.\n\nFirst Nations women are particularly vulnerable. Along the main Highway of Tears stretch from Prince Rupert to Prince George there are 23 different indigenous communities or reserves. Most of these little places have few facilities like medical services, educational outlets and recreational opportunities. As well, poverty is a gigantic problem in Canada\u2019s First Peoples settlements. They simply can\u2019t afford private transportation.\n\nCombined with personal issues and the need to be mobile, many at-risk women are alone on side of the road with their thumb out. They\u2019re perfect opportunities for men with deviant desire. Here is a list of who fell victim in the deadly web called the Highway of Tears and throughout the entire region.\n\nGloria Moody \u2014 27, Murdered near Williams Lake, October 1969\nMicheline Pare \u2014 18, Murdered near Hudson\u2019s Hope, July 1970\nHelen Claire Frost \u2014 15, Missing from Prince George, October 1970\nJean Virginia Sampare \u2014 18, Missing from Hazelton, October 1971\nGayle Weys \u2014 19, Murdered near Clearwater, October 1973\nPamela Darlington \u2014 19, Murdered at Kamloops, November 1973\nColeen MacMillan \u2014 16, Murdered near Lac La Hache, August 1974\nMonica Ignas \u2014 15, Murdered near Terrace, December 1974\nMary Jane Hill \u2014 31, Murdered at Prince Rupert, March 1978\nMonica Jack \u2014 12, Murdered near Merritt, May 1978\nMaureen Mosie \u2014 33, Murdered near Salmon Arm, May 1981\nJean May Kovacs \u2014 36, Murdered at Prince George, October 1981\nRoswitha Fuchsbichler \u2014 13, Murdered at Prince George, November 1981\nNina Marie Joseph \u2014 15, Murdered at Prince George, August 1982\nShelley-Anne Bascu \u2014 16, Missing from Hinton, May 1983\nAlberta Gail Williams \u2014 24, Murdered near Prince Rupert, August\u00a0 1989\nCecilia Anne Nikal \u2014 15, Missing from Smithers, October 1989\nDelphine Anne Nikal \u2014 15, Missing from Smithers, June 1990\nTheresa Umphrey \u2014 38, Murdered near Prince George, February 1993\nMarnie Blanchard \u2014 18, Murdered near Prince George, March 1993\nRamona Lisa Wilson \u2014 16, Murdered near Smithers, June 1994\nRoxanne Thiara \u2014 15, Murdered near Burns Lake, November 1994\nAlishia Leah Germaine \u2014 15, Murdered at Prince George, November 1994\nLana Derrick \u2014 19, Missing from Terrace, October 1995\nDeena Braem \u2014 16, Murdered near Quesnel, September 1999\nMonica McKay \u2014 18, Murdered at Prince Rupert, December 1999\nNicole Hoar \u2014 24, Missing from Prince George, June 2002\nMary Madeline George \u2014 25, Missing from Prince George, July 2005\nTamara Lynn Chipman \u2014 22, Missing from Prince Rupert, September 2005\nAielah Saric Auger \u2014 14, Murdered at Prince George, February 2006\nBeverly Warbick \u2014 20, Missing from Prince George, June 2007\nBonnie Marie Joseph \u2014\u00a032, Missing from Vanderhoof, September 2007\nJill Stacey Stuchenko \u2014 35, Murdered near Prince George, October 2009\nEmmalee Rose McLean \u2014 16, Murdered at Prince Rupert, April 2010\nNatasha Lynn Montgomery \u2014 23, Murdered at Prince George, August 2010\nCynthia Frances Maas\u2014 35, Murdered near Prince George, September 2010\nLoren Dawn Leslie \u2014 15, Murdered near Prince George, November 2010\nMadison \u201cMaddy\u201d Scott \u2014 20, Missing near Vanderhoof, May 2011\nImmaculate \u201cMackie\u201d Basil \u2014 26, Missing near Fort St. James, June 2013\nAnita Florence Thorne \u2014 49, Missing from Prince George, November 2014\nRoberta Marie Sims \u2014 55, Missing from Prince George, May 2017\nFrances Brown \u2014 53, Missing near Smithers, October 2017\nChantelle Catherine Simpson \u2014 34, Suspicious Death at Terrace, July 2018\nJessica Patrick \u2014 18, Murdered near Smithers, September 2018\nCynthia Martin \u2014 50, Missing near Hazelton, December 2018\nThe Case for a Highway of Tears Serial Killer\n\nThese 40+ known cases all have a similarity beyond the E-Pana parameters. That\u2019s the peculiar pattern of how they met their fate. Investigators assume most victims did not know their assailant and unsuspectingly fell into a fatal trap. And that trap may have been set by a serial offender.\n\nBefore assuming that one or more serial killers have been on the loose in the E-Pana project and the entire cases associated to the general Highway of Tears area, it\u2019s necessary to define what a serial killer is. According to the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a serial killer is an offender who commits \u201ca series of two or more murders, committed as separate events, usually, but not always, by one offender acting alone.\u201d Serial murder is defined as \u201cthe unlawful killing of two or more victims by the same offender(s), in separate events.\u201d\n\nThis is a fairly tight description for a multiple killer. It fits someone on a path or destiny rather than a mass-murderer who goes on one rampage and causes numerous deaths. Most people associate serial killers with notorious Americans like Ted Bundy, Gary Ridgway or Albert DeSalvo. They were particularly nasty people. But, British Columbia had its share of these vicious villains. Noteworthy BC serial killers were Clifford Olson who killed 10 or more children and Robert \u201cWillie\u201d Pickton who did-in 49 women and fed them to his pigs.\n\nMost serial killers operate alone and have a distinctive pattern or modus operandi. Experienced police investigators know to look for crime patterns and identify similarities. One of the main indicators is victim profiling. In almost all of the cases brought under the Highway of Tears investigation umbrella, the victim\u2019s background and vulnerability stand out. Other indicators are the time frame and location.\n\nIn missing persons cases, investigators naturally start with where and when the victim was last seen. They also look for abandoned items such as a vehicle, their purse and contents or their phone. Where bodies are found, investigators look for the mechanism or means of death. Most of the Highway of Tears and related victims were strangled\u2014the exact strangulation method being held back as it\u2019s known only to the police and the perpetrator.\n\nIn the Highway of Tears periphery\u2014and it is a periphery because what started as an investigation along the Prince George to Prince Rupert road quickly branched off to a much bigger area where a mobile serial killer could have easily traveled within a day. What\u2019s really notable in this overall murder and missing persons combined investigation are the time periods. There are nine distinct activity calendar groups:\n\n1969-1974\n1978\n1981-1983\n1989-1990\n1993-1995\n1999-2002\n2005-2007\n2009-2014\n2017-2018\n\nThis date grouping shows a burst of start-stop, start-stop and start-stop. There could be many reasons for this such as the perpetrator being repeatedly incarcerated, moving out of the geographical area or, in the case of Gary Ridgway\u2014the Green River Killer from Seattle\u2014he nearly got caught and thought he\u2019d give it a rest for a while. But, it seems more likely there are multiple offenders in the overall Highway of Tears file. In fact, police have already caught, convicted or identified five different HOT-profile men.\n\nThe Police Catch or Identify Serial Killers in the Highway of Tears Investigation\n\nTo be fair, not all the murdered or missing women in the previous list are true Highway of Tears victims from BC Highways 16, 97 & 5. As the investigation grew, it expanded to include a wide net of confirmed or suspected murders across the mid-section of semi-rural British Columbia. That was a natural progression. It\u2019s a logical and competent way of investigating a broad range of offense dates and locations.\n\nLong before the E-Pana probe in 2005, which started as a look at the cases on Highway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert, the RCMP knew there was a pattern emerging. In 1981, they held a multi-jurisdictional meeting called The Highway Murders Conference to look at commonalities of historic unsolved murders and missing persons cases. Over 40 detectives from across BC and Alberta met in Kamloops and presented their case facts. This was the original start to a massive investigation that\u2019s still highly-active today.\n\nIn the years following the Highway Murder Conference, the RCMP and other law enforcement agencies solved some of the \u201cHOT\u201d killings and disappearances. They were able to profile offenders under the FBI\u2019s serial killer definition. Here are the five serial killers known to have committed murders on the overall HOT list.\n\n1. Cody Alan Legebokoff\u00a0 \u2014 He was convicted of the 2009/2010 Jill Stuchenko, Natasha Montgomery, Loren Leslie and Cynthia Maas murders near Prince George. Legebokoff is serving life in prison.\n\n2. Brian Peter Arp \u2014 He was convicted of the 1989 near-Prince George murders of Theresa Umphrey and Marnie Blanchard. Arp is also serving a life sentence.\n\n3. Edward Dennis Issac \u2014 He was convicted of the 1981/1892 murders of Nina Joseph, Jean Kovacs and Roswitha Fuchsbichler in Prince George. Issac is still serving out his life sentence\n\n4, Gary Wayne Hanlin \u2014 He was convicted of the 1978 Monica Jack murder at Merritt and faces new charges for killing another pre-teen girl. Hanlin got a life sentence, as well.\n\n5. Bobby Jack Fowler \u2014 This known serial killer died in an Oregon prison in 1986. Post-death DNA analysis linked Fowler to causing the 1973/1974 Kamloops area murders of Coleen McMillan, Gail Weys and Pamela Darlington. Given the time frame pattern and location, Fowler may also have killed Monica Ignas in Terrace.\n\nKnown Highway of Tears Serial Killer Bobby Jack Fowler \u2013 MacMillan, Weys & Darlington murders\n\nThe Highway of Tears Public Investigations and Inquiries\n\nOver the years, the mass of unsolved murders and missing women\u2019s cases have been front and center in British Columbia and Canadian spectrums. Local, national and international interest spread, and took on a scope much larger than the cases committed along the original roadway called the Highway of Tears. Hundreds of thousands of hours and millions of dollar have been exhausted trying to rectify what went wrong and how future tragedies could be prevented.\n\nIn 2006, the British Columbia probe called the Highway of Tears Symposium released a report with an objective look at the entire factors causing victim vulnerability. They made rational and constructive recommendations that, if correctly implemented, could drastically reduce the potential for other women to end up on the HOT list. The symposium divided their solution into these four categories:\n\nVictim Prevention\nEmergency Planning and Team Readiness\nVictim Family Counselling and Support\nCommunity Development and Support\n\nThe Highway of Tears Symposium offered 33 separate recommendations on how to reduce victim risk and how to organize a holistic crime prevention program throughout the at-risk region. Most of the recommendations were solid, common-sense steps that could be practically implemented. One of the primary actions was to increase public transit along Highway 16 so the women wouldn\u2019t need to hitchhike.\n\nOther smart points in the action plan were making the police and public officials more responsible for spotting women placing themselves at risk and intervening on the side of the road. The report recommended a network of safe houses and a community watch program be integrated across the area. Many more recommendations addressed education and economic support for vulnerable women.\n\nIt\u2019s been 13 years since the Highway of Tears Symposium did its necessary and valuable work. Sadly, very few of their well-thought-out suggestions ever materialized. An example is that it took 11 years before a simple and reliably-scheduled public transit bus service hit the Yellowhead Highway. Some of the risk prevention literature has been well written and promoted, though.\n\nThe Canadian Federal Government\u2019s cross-country consortium called the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (IMMIWG) took public problem probing to a whole new level. What started as a Highway of Tears inquiry expanding the plight of First Nations women turned into a f-fest where three of the leading commissioners quit in frustration and disgust. It seemed everyone with a grievance to grind and an agenda to advance hijacked the focus and spun it around. By the time the $53.8 million off-track inquisition ended, the indigenous women core concern expanded to include every fringe interest lumped into a category called 2SLGBTQQIA. That\u2019s an acronym for 2 Spirit, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Questioning, Intersex and Asexual.\n\nOn June 4, 2019, the Canadian Prime Minister championed the IMMIWG report release with this quote, \u201cEarlier this morning, the national inquiry formally presented their report, in which they found that the tragic violence that Indigenous women and girls have experienced amounts to genocide\u201d. The Prime Minister\u2019s critics were quick to point out the United Nations definition of genocide:\n\n\u201cAny of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\u201d\n\nWhat started as a well-intentioned review of what happened to cause the Highway of Tears-related murders and suspicious disappearances totally missed the mark in the Canadian Federal Government\u2019s sights. While the HOT Symposium operated with honorable intentions, the IMMIWG was a farce. It contributed little, if nothing, to the cause and likely did more harm than good. The IMMIWG failed to make positive recommendations for future harm prevention and investigation improvements. Ultimately, the IMMIWG blamed colonialism for oppressive behavior on margins of society. It seems the IMMIWG forgot many of the Highway of Tears victims were white heterosexual women born and raised in mainstream Canada.\n\nIs a Serial Killer Loose on the Highway of Tears?\n\nThe answer is yes and no. There isn\u2019t , and never has been, one lone serial killer continually at work on the Highway of Tears or in the surrounding geographical area. The right answer is there are many serial killers out there who\u2019ve traveled those remote highways for years. Without a doubt, at least five separate serial killers contributed to some of the forty-year carnage. It\u2019s highly-likely a large number of the yet-unsolved cases are the work of still-to-be-caught perpetrators. And, it\u2019s also highly-likely some murders and abductions are one-offs.\n\nWill all the Highway of Tears related murders eventually be solved? It\u2019s highly-unlikely that\u2019ll happen given the time gone by and the limited evidence available. However, there\u2019s good reason to be optimistic some old and cold cases will be cleared. Back in the 70s, no one saw how powerful forensic DNA typing would be. We\u2019re only now starting to tap the new familial database mines. Back in the 70s, no one saw how effective the Mister Big undercover sting would work on serial killers. And, back in the 70s, information sharing was nothing like what\u2019s happening today.\n\nSo, no one knows what\u2019s to come. Thanks to high-tech science combining with cool cop creative minds, we\u2019re in for an interesting crime-solving drive down the Highway of Tears.\n\nFacebook\nMastodon\nEmail\nShare\nThis entry was posted in Forensics, Life & Death and tagged Bobby Jack Fowler, Brian Peter Arp, British Columbia, Canada, Canadian, Cody Legebokoff, Edward Dennis Isaac, FBI Definition, Gary Wayne Hanlin, Highway of Tears, Missing Murdered Indigenous Women Girls, Murders, National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, Project E-Pana, RCMP, Serial Killer, Serial Killings, Symposium, Yellowhead 16 on August 24, 2019.\nPost navigation\n\u2190 IS MISSING MALAYSIA AIRLINES FLIGHT 370 A MASS MURDER?\nIS THE MEANING OF LIFE A HAM SANDWICH?

It astounds me that most of the recommendations made in the 2006 symposium haven\u2019t been acted upon!\n\nI remember when Willy Pickton was on trial and while I don\u2019t know where the statement lead to, he said something like \u201cI don\u2019t work alone, and there\u2019s a chain / network of us.\u201d Makes me shiver. I\u2019m not saying Pickton was responsible for these murders, but is there a possibility of a network of serial killers at work in mid-northern BC?\n\nIt\u2019s odd to me, also, that the common thread amongst these murders was strangulation, even though some separate killers have been caught.\n\nGarry Rodgers\nPost author\nJune 19, 2020 at 6:47 am\n\nI do remember that statement from Pickton, although I can\u2019t recall who he made it to or under what circumstances. I think strangulation is simply convenient as the highway murders were/are opportunistic rather than planned and there is no other immediate mechanism available. And as for the symposium \u2013 that\u2019s just another commission where there\u2019s a lot of blah, blah, blah at the time and no one is held accountable to make sure the recommendations are carried out. Thanks for commenting, Faith\n\nAnniqa\nJanuary 9, 2020 at 4:43 am\n\nHi. I\u00b4m just writing a book review about the book Highway of Tears, and it has been fascinating reading all the information you provide here at your blog. Thank you so much\n\nGarry Rodgers\nPost author\nJanuary 9, 2020 at 7:31 am\n\nNice to hear you found this useful, Anniqa. Thanks for letting me know \n\nSue Coletta\nAugust 25, 2019 at 7:05 am\n\nYou summarized these cases beautifully, Garry. I also believe there are several serial killers operating on the Highway of Tears, and quite possibly are members of the long haul truckers serial killer clan. I forget the name they use. One U.S. member was caught, and I watched a chilling account of how they operated, swapping abducted girls between them like baseball cards. If one member saw another member\u2019s \u201ctype\u201d he\u2019d abduct her and call his buddy. In turn, the buddy would do the same. Frightening.\n\nGarry Rodgers\nPost author\nAugust 25, 2019 at 7:47 am\n\nThanks, Sue. I thought this title would catch your eye  It makes sense that multiple offenders have operated / are operating on the HOT regions and I think you have something there with the long haul trucker suspicion. It makes sense that a victim would likely be more at ease getting into a professional-looking big rig than some sleazy windowless van. I\u2019ve never heard about a trucker SK clan, but the more I read about the psyche of SK offenders, the less surprised I am about their deviancy. BTW, thanks for your input on the FBI SK definition!\n\nEmery\nAugust 24, 2019 at 12:52 pm\n\nI meant to say I was reading an article about Brittany written last week. She actually died in 2018. She was aboriginal and had a drug problem. RCMP said she did not die of any criminality. Her family still questions her death but RCMP rule out foul play.\n\nGarry Rodgers\nPost author\nAugust 24, 2019 at 1:04 pm\n\nThanks for clarifying this, Emery. I did a quick Google and it looks like an accidental drug overdose. Puzzling how she ended up where she was.\n\nCaroline Samantha Davis\nJuly 1, 2021 at 5:32 pm\n\nI have read your article and the comments. One crucial factor is missing from the comments; no funds for public transport and no funds for a vehicle result in no mobility. It is fine to say people should not hitchhike. I agree. However, if there was no other option, would I take the risk? I hitchhiked when I was younger and invincible, and the world was a safer place. Given the circumstances, would I hitch Hwy 16 as a vulnerable, marginalized female? Quite possibly. I do not know. I have never been in that situation as I do have access to public transportation, a vehicle, or friends who can take me where I need to go.\nWhen I first came to Canada as a teen from England, I knew nothing about \u2018Indians\u2019 as they were called and little about the colonization of the \u2018New World.\u2019 I played Cops and Robbers with the Cops always winning. Or Cowboys and Indians, with the Cowboys always winning. I did know that \u2018In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue; Tonto was The Lone Ranger\u2019s sidekick and that Indians were a highly spiritual race. Upon arrival in Canada, I heard that all Indians are on welfare, alcoholics, and the only good Indian is a dead Indian.\nSince that time, we have changed wording from Indian to a more respectful nomenclature of First Nations. I am saddened that our thoughts and perceptions have not changed accordingly. There is but one race, the human race. We should celebrate our ethnicities and various cultures. We do not choose the circumstances of our birth \u2013 our parents, the geographical location, the finances, the level of education, etc.\nIt is all well and good to state our past does not define our future; in many cases, it does, as in the 23 indigenous communities allotted to those that live along the Highway of Tears. Before we say what we would or would not do, let us walk a mile in their moccasins. If the missing person was YOUR daughter, would you want her to be dismissed, or would you expect or even demand the police value her, that the media highlights her status as missing, that others are concerned and want to help\u2026 or would you say she should not have hitchhiked?\n\nEmery\nAugust 24, 2019 at 9:47 am\n\nIt\u2019s sad that so many of these young woman do not heed the warnings of danger. Hiking, (hitchhiking) on wilderness highways is high-risk. Even travelling with a friend (buddy) you are still at risk. I remember when Nicole Hoar went missing. She was a tree planter who came from Alberta. Close to her family and very reliable. And I don\u2019t believe she was aboriginal. It was about this time my friend\u2019s daughter was working as a tree planter up in northern BC. Making money to help her through University. Once Nicole Hoar went missing, my friend\u2019s daughter returned home. Last week, another young woman, Brittany Martel was found murdered off Highway 5, just south of Merritt. She apparently travelled/hitch-hiked the highways in BC often and had no concerns. All we can do is try to educate our children to the dangers of hitchhiking the northern highways, any highways for that matter. If they are fearless and don\u2019t want to listen there is not much a parent or a family member can do. Only pray that they will come home safe. I hope just one young person reads your story and thinks twice about taking to the highways.\n\nGarry Rodgers\nPost author\nAugust 24, 2019 at 10:10 am\n\nThanks for your thoughtful comment, Emery. For sure, if this piece is read by an at-risk person and it makes them think twice before jumping in a stranger\u2019s vehicle then it\u2019s well served its purpose. From what I read while I put this together, Nicole Hoar\u2019s disappearance was a catalyst for bringing on the 2006 Symposium. Nicole was Caucasian and came from a well-to-do environment in Red Deer, Alberta. There was a mass effort to find Nicole and a lot of money was raised and put into the public awareness campaign \u2013 unlike the attention given to many indigenous women\u2019s disappearances. The financial inequity caught people\u2019s attention and it was one more force that brought on the BC Symposium which, in my opinion, had some excellent recommendations.\n\nDan Kyle\nAugust 25, 2019 at 11:45 am\n\nhttps://www.burnabynow.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-stop-asking-why-these-burnaby-assault-victims-were-out-alone-1.23898158\n\nOne reason young women do not heed warnings of danger is that we live in a politically correct era where telling women they are currently not adequately prepared to defend themselves from a larger, heavier aggressive male is met with angry \u201cprogressive\u201d opposition \u2013 witness the article above as an example. Foolishness! I have never let my wife or daughter walk alone at night or in isolated areas \u2013 or without a cell phone \u2013 and have always been ready to fetch them or drive them anywhere at any hour. But hey, that\u2019s so chauvinistic, right?\n\nGarry Rodgers\nPost author\nAugust 25, 2019 at 12:02 pm\n\nThanks, Dan. I checked out your link and I think there\u2019s a balance between being \u201ccorrect\u201d and using common sense. Any woman who\u2019s out alone at night in a secluded place or hitchhiking the highways significantly increase their risk of attack. It doesn\u2019t matter how much they have a right to this freedom, the reality is it\u2019s a serious safety threat that can be minimized through sensible precautions. I wish the world wasn\u2019t this way, but sadly it is.

Some information may no longer be current.\n\nA stretch of the Highway of Tears runs through a small Aboriginal community east of Prince Rubert, British Columbia, pictured on March 21, 2011. There are 18 unsolved cases involving women reported missing or found dead along the highway.\nRAFAL GERSZAK/THE GLOBE AND MAIL\n\nCOMMENTS\nSHARE\n\nCommunity leaders along British Columbia's notorious Highway of Tears meet this week to debate the highly charged issue of improving safety along the route that cuts across the centre of the province.\n\nEighteen women have been murdered or disappeared along Highway 16 and adjacent routes since the 1970s.\n\nFirst Nations' leaders and the Opposition New Democrats say government roadblocks in the form of endless meetings over transportation solutions that go nowhere must come down to improving safety.\n\nUp to 100 people are expected to be in Smithers to review locally developed transportation options along the 750-kilometre highway corridor, but Transportation Minister Todd Stone won't attend and said he would leave the discussion up to local officials.\n\nMr. Stone describes the Tuesday meeting as information gathering and non-political.\n\nNorth Coast New Democrat MLA Jennifer Rice, who represents the Prince Rupert area, wanted to go to the meeting, but said she wasn't invited.\n\n\"I understand the chief administrative officers (from communities) are invited because those are the practical people. Minister Stone is always talking about practical solutions, and I guess those are the practical people who implement practical things.\"\n\nRepresentatives from 23 First Nations along the corridor, municipal governments and the B.C. government will attend the day-long meeting.\n\nA government statement said the gathering will review previous community transportation reports, including a 2006 report that called for bus service between communities and the 2012 Missing Women Commission of Inquiry that recommended enhanced transportation in the area.\n\nRegional politician Bill Miller said many agree that Highway 16 is too geographically challenged for a region-wide bus service, but there's concern about government stalling.\n\n\"Sometimes it seems like we've just been put on a treadmill,\" said Miller, an elected member of the Bulkley-Nechako Regional District. \"We have some cost-effective and efficient solutions.\"\n\nHe said a more workable system would link neighbours such as Vanderhoof, Fort St. James and Fraser Lake and would ease safety concerns for those who have to travel the route.\n\n\"The underlying issue is vulnerability of women in general, First Nations women in specific.\"\n\nBut he said local governments need the province to help communities get the locally driven transportation system.\n\n\"We're going to send some people to the symposium in Smithers and hopefully get them to understand that this is a significant issue.\"\n\nMr. Stone said he agrees with some locals that a shuttle-bus service along the entire route isn't practical. But the NDP said that recently released documents contradict Stone and highlight the concerns of local officials who say a bus service should be considered.\n\n\"A lot of people are feeling this is past due and this is time to take action,\" Ms. Rice said.\n\nAmong the more than 600 pages of recently released government documents are bus service estimates, pegging costs of a six-day-a-week, Prince Rupert to Prince George bus at less than $1-million annually.\n\nFinance Minister Mike de Jong said last week he expects to deliver a quarterly financial update that includes improved financial forecasts, fuelling speculation the government has some money for targeted initiatives.\n\nMr. Stone recently acknowledged the highway issue could be swept up in a call by the federal Liberal government for an inquiry into Canada's murdered and missing women.\n\nAn RCMP report last year stated nearly 1,200 aboriginal women were murdered or went missing between 1980 and 2012.\n\nSign up for the B.C.

Her childhood was marred by stays in foster care. She was abducted and assaulted as a teen. She says she knows all too well the world that Indigenous women can live in.\n\nIt was fashion that empowered Coltman. She signed with a modelling agency in 1972 and later created her own.\n\nBut the issue of violence toward Indigenous women and girls remained close to her heart.\n\nWhen she saw the red dress movement, Coltman says she was inspired, and in 2015 she founded Fashion Speaks International. The organization has produced fashion shows in Canada, Australia and France highlighting Indigenous designers, models and artists. Each show also brings attention to missing women through stories and photos.\n\n0:50\nOttawa protesters demand search for missing, murdered Indigenous women in Winnipeg landfills\n\nColtman says it\u2019s powerful watching Indigenous models hold their heads high as they walk the runway. It breaks behaviours pushed on the estimated 150,000 Indigenous children who were forced to attend residential schools, she says.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe residential school taught them that they were to be seen not heard, and they were to look at their feet when they walk,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to make our people less invisible.\u201d\n\nIndigenous women and girls in Canada remain highly overrepresented as victims of violence. Between 2009 and 2021, the homicide rate among Indigenous women and girls was six times higher than their non-Indigenous counterparts, Statistics Canada said in a report last year.\n\nCanada and Manitoba announced a partnership Friday for a Red Dress Alert system that would inform the public when an Indigenous woman or girl is reported missing. The pilot project is expected to help inform an eventual national alert system.\n\nMORE ON CANADA\nHurricane Beryl forces Canadian airlines to cancel flights.

(Jonathan Hayward / THE CANADIAN PRESS)\n\nSHARE:\nReddit\n\n\n\n\nPRINCE GEORGE, B.C. - A bus service that links communities along a notorious stretch of highway in northern British Columbia known as the Highway of Tears will carry passengers by the end of the year, the province's transportation minister said Wednesday.\n\nEighteen women have been murdered or have disappeared along Highway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert and adjacent routes since the 1970s.\n\nFirst Nations, social service agencies and women's groups have been calling for a shuttle bus service in the area for several years to provide regular transportation for people who live in communities along the 750-kilometre route.\n\nThe highway cuts through the centre of the province and follows rivers and mountains, passing through numerous small communities, including Houston, Smithers and Burns Lake. The route also provides the main transportation link to and from remote First Nations villages located off the main highway.\n\nMost cases of murdered and missing women remain unsolved, though investigators don't believe a single killer is responsible.\n\nTransportation Minister Todd Stone says agreements between 16 communities along the highway will allow B.C. Transit to operate a scheduled bus service between Prince George and Prince Rupert.\n\n\"Absolutely, this initiative is all about safety,\" he said.\n\nHe said the communities, the province and B.C. Transit must still develop service schedules and provide extra buses for the route.\n\nStone said plans for the Highway 16 area also include offering bus driver training programs for First Nations to provide transportation service from their remote villages to other major communities along the highway.\n\nChief Corrina Leween of the Cheslatta Carrier Nation said the bus service helps many living in towns on or near the highway, but it offers little comfort to those off the main road.\n\n\"The work they are doing for the core group on the corridor is good, but for us it really doesn't work because we're off the beaten trail,\" she said.\n\nLeween said the main Cheslatta community of about 300 people is located about 25 kilometres south of Burns Lake and getting to the highway requires a ferry trip and travel on a dirt road.\n\nFive Cheslatta people, including a family of four and a male elder, have disappeared from the area over the years, she said.\n\nNew Democrat Maurine Karagianis, the Opposition's critic for women, said area residents and local politicians have called for improved transportation services for years, but the government has been stalling while many people hitchhike for rides with strangers.\n\n\"I say get on with it,\" she said.\n\nFirst Nations advocate Mary Teegee said a decade ago, dozens of people walked from Prince Rupert to Prince George to call for better transportation service along the highway.\n\n\"It has been 10 years since of the Highway of Tears recommendations report came out and we are finally making progress,\" she said in a statement. \"I view transportation as a human rights issue in the north and we are working toward making sure everyone has access.\"\n\nSHARE:\nReddit\nReport an error\nEditorial standards and\u00a0policies\nWhy you can trust CTV\u00a0News\nMORE NEWS FROM CANADA\nBorder workers who nearly went on strike in June ratify new contract\n'Finally I know who I am': Holocaust survivor\u2019s daughter reunited with long lost brother in Poland\n'It's a lot to digest': Calgary man wins $66M on Lotto 6-49 draw\n'Not my finest moment:' Police called to dispute between Ottawa city councillor and daycare owner\nWhat you need to know about a possible LCBO strike on Friday\nInstant noodle products sold in B.C., Alta., Ont. recalled due to undeclared peanut\nTOP VIDEOS\nfalse\nQue. students accuse teacher of profiting off their artwork\nfalse\nCar thefts in Canada: Insurance companies face criticism\nfalse\n$50K reward offered in case of missing Barrie, Ont. woman\nCTVNEWS.CA TOP STORIES\nTrying to sell or buy a home this summer?

(Photo by Alex Kozroski)\n\nByron Watson is a 23-year-old who went missing from the community of Maple Creek over five months ago, which has come together to honour him.\n\nWatson\u2019s disappearance shook Nekaneet First Nation and the town of Maple Creek, both of which gathered on Sunday, national Red Dress Day, to show they had not forgotten him. Members of Watson\u2019s family organized a walk around Maple Creek, bringing together the two communities to which he once belonged.\n\nLori Watson, Byron Watson\u2019s Aunt, played an important role in organizing the event.\n\n\u201cMy sister Arlene wanted to honour her son who went missing; she just didn\u2019t want people to forget about him,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really happy with all the support people have shown, like even for them showing up, walking with us, and honouring Byron.\u201d\n\nBeginning at the place where Byron Watson was last seen, the walk commenced after a traditional prayer and smudging ceremony. Over 100 participants joined in the walk, many donning red clothing with Watson\u2019s photo for Red Dress Day, the concurrent national event which raises awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\n\nRailey Mosquito, another aunt of Byron Watson, joined in on the walk and spoke to the level of participation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really proud moment as a community member,\u201d stated Mosquito. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see the movement, and that he\u2019s bringing awareness to this subject as well because we don\u2019t want him to feel like he\u2019s forgotten.\u201d\n\nThe event concluded with a barbecue, serving hotdogs and hamburgers to many of the walk\u2019s participants.\n\nAnyone with any information regarding the 23-year-old's whereabouts is asked to contact Maple Creek RCMP or Crime Stoppers to remain anonymous.\n\nA Facebook group has been created to share information on the case and can be accessed here.\n\nNEXT STORY\nRainfall warning triggered for southwest\nLATEST IN LOCAL NEWS\nSafety, health, and the work place a focus this week in Swift Current\nLocal women rally for Red Dress Day\nChamber on Tap taps into the secret behind rural community growth\nKindersley man charged with sexual assault of teenager\nLATEST STORIES ON SWIFTCURRENTONLINE\nThe Simon & Garfunkel Story\nSpring Fling continues to grow into the next big thing\n14U Sundogs win Montana tournament\nBusy weekend for Rampage Lacrosse squads\nEvents\nSwift Current 57\u2019s Baseball Club Home Game\nThu, Jul 4, 7:00 PM\nPride Centre Grand Reopening!\nSat, Jul 6, 9:00 AM\nCountry Pleasures TEAHOUSE\nSat, Jul 6, 1:38 PM\nSwift Current 57\u2019s Baseball Club Home Game\nSat, Jul 6, 7:00 PM\nSaskatchewan Motocross Round 4 Located in Swift Current.\nSun, Jul 7, 9:15 AM\nView more \nJobs\nPowered by\nLumber Yard Office Manager\nFull-time, Salary, Administrative, Retail, Sales\nFeatured\nTruck or Combine Operator\nHourly, Seasonal, Agriculture, Labour\nOffice Clerk I - Credit (TEMPORARY FT)\nFinance, Administrative, Term\nHeavy Duty Mechanic Apprentice\nFull-time, Skilled Trades\nFarm Labourer - Summer Student\nSeasonal, Agriculture\nView more \nBuy & Sell\nPowered by\nRadio frequency machine\n$350\n2017 Ford Explorer XLT\n$32900\nPerennials\n$5\nFishing hunting shooting bag\n$45\nHead massager\n$100\nView more \nCKSW\nCJSN\nCountry 94\nMagic 97.1\nPodcasts\nGet the App\nNEWS\nLocal News\nAg News\nLocal Sports\nNational News\nCommunity\nFuneral Announcements\nSponsored\nWeather\nFEATURES\nEvents\nLocalJobShop\nHelloGoodBuy Classifieds\nGarage Sales\nGreeting Zone\nRoad Reports and Cancellations\nLocal Sports Live\nInspirational Programming Guide\nTrading Post\nCONTESTS\nSouthwest Explorer\nTip Of The Hat\nCONNECT\nContact Us\nSubmit News\nMeet the Team\nFacebook\nX\nYouTube\nStreaming\nRSS\nAdvertise With Us\nCareers\nContest Rules\nAccessibility\nTerms Of Use Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\nJournalistic Standards"},

One briefing note said communities view naming Highway 16 as the Highway of Tears \"as negative.\"\n\nAnother note from a meeting in Smithers states, \"missing women must be part of the conversation as that is the only reason the Ministry of Transportation is in the room.\"\n\nJennifer Rice, the New Democrat member for Prince Rupert, told the legislature Tuesday that the documents show that the government has been denying that First Nations women and local residents have concerns about lack of safe transportation alternatives on the highway.\n\nMr. Stone said the highway is safer than it was 15 years ago. He pointed to government efforts to improve cellular service in the area and the introduction of a health bus that helps take people living in rural areas to medical appointments.\n\n\"The important thing here, I think, for people on Highway 16, is that we continue to focus on how we can make this corridor safer, and that's the work I'm pouring myself into. That's the work my officials are putting their shoulders into,\" said Mr. Stone.\n\nHe said the government has released 600 pages of information on Highway 16 since 2012.\n\nThe government has come under fire recently after a Transportation Ministry employee deleted potentially sensitive e-mails about the Highway of Tears investigation. A whistle-blower later complained and that set off an investigation by B.C.'s privacy commissioner.\n\nLast's month's report by Commissioner Elizabeth Denham highlighted a failure by the government to keep adequate e-mail records or document searches and the willful destruction of records in response to a freedom-of-information request.\n\nHer report, Access Denied, said high-ranking officials in the premier's office were found to have no e-mail records during freedom-of-information requests and attempts to obtain Premier Christy Clark's e-mail records also found nothing on her e-mail account.\n\nClark has since directed ministers and government staff to save the e-mails they send until the completion of a review of Ms. Denham's report.\n\nSign up for the B.C.

The new service between the city and the Hazeltons filled the last-remaining gap in the Highway 16 Transportation Action Plan. (File photo)\n\nBC Transit\u2019s new service connecting communities along the Highway of Tears has earned high praise from both the Canadian Urban Transit Association (CUTA) and B.C.\u2019s premier, John Horgan.\n\nLast week CUTA recognized the Highway 16 Transportation Action Plan with a 2018 Award for Safety and Security, in recognition of the project\u2019s \u201ccommitment to enhancing the safety and security of employees and customers through the development of an effective safety and security program.\u201d\n\nAlso last month, the plan received a regional and provincial Premier\u2019s Award for Partnerships, recognizing the collaborative efforts of BC Transit, the provincial government, First Nations communities, local governments and regional districts, and the families involved with the Highway of Tears initiative.\n\n\u201cPeople in northern B.C., and in particular women and teenaged girls, need to feel safe travelling between communities, and that\u2019s what the Highway 16 Transportation Action Plan is now providing,\u201d said Transportation and Infrastructure Minister Claire Trevena in a press release. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see how the increase in bus service, community vehicles and other aspects of the plan have come together and provided a significant boost to safe and reliable travel for people in northern B.C.\u201d\n\nSince November of last year, BC Transit began offering contiguous service from Terrace to Prince George \u2014 a route of almost 600 kilometres. The schedule was designed to allow for return travel from small communities to the nearest large centre on the same day.\n\nPrior to their pullout of the north, Greyhound was often criticized by Highway of Tears advocates for its inconvenient scheduling, often dropping off passengers at Hwy 16 destinations late at night.\n\nHighway of Tears safety and justice advocate Gladys Radek, and aunt of Tamara Chipman, last seen hitchhiking near Prince Rupert in 2005, also offered praise for BC Transit\u2019s program.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always room for improvement, but I\u2019m actually very, very happy with having our own transit system up here.\u201d\n\nShe says some of the smaller on-reserve communities could still benefit from the service, but overall she\u2019s heard only positive feedback from female riders.\n\nBecause all drivers are local, who know the area and the people, Radek believes the plan fosters a safer environment for passengers.\n\n\u201cGreyhound wasn\u2019t there for the people anymore. Their focus, in the end, was only on parcel delivery. With BC Transit, I\u2019m hearing nothing but good things. It\u2019s good for all of us and it\u2019s keeping local eyes on our girls.\u201d\n\nThe province has committed to five years of transit funding to the Highway 16 Transportation Action Plan, a project worth $6.4 million. The funding covers the cost of buses and two-thirds of operating costs. Local governments and First Nations partners are responsible for the remaining third of costs.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nquinn@terracestandard.com\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\nAbout the Author: Quinn Bender\n\nRead more\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tNorthwest B.C. author pens book about logging\n\t\tTeen dies after overdose involving fentanyl in northern B.C.: RCMP\n\t\t'You shattered her life': 3 years for sexual assault of young Kelowna woman\n\t\tMan dies throwing candy during Alberta Canada Day parade\n\t\tTom Havard is this year\u2019s Hudson Bay Mountain Legendary Local\nFacebook Comments (0) \nMan who stabbed Mexican tourist at B.C.

Go to celebrations and pow-wows where you can experience the culture,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, if you are unsure ask questions respectfully.

The group formed around individuals of a like mind desiring to build strong relationships and advance a long-term commitment toward Reconciliation. An educational session is provided at each meeting and has delved into everything from the teachings of Elders and Residential School Survivors to sessions on anti-racist education, creating a land acknowledgement statement and an inclusion and diversity strategy. PRRC hosts an annual educational gathering and this year\u2019s event will be held in Hepburn, SK at Heritage Common on April 11th from 9 am to 4:30 pm. This year\u2019s theme, \u201cNavigating the Journey Together,\u201d embraces the significance of rivers. With the majority of the members of the Circle coming from the lands between the two branches of the Saskatchewan River, its presence naturally stands forefront in the awareness of this geological space, but water and rivers are principal elements in Indigenous culture. As shared by Shirley Williams, an Anishinaabe elder from Wikwemikong Unceded Territory on Manitoulin Island, to CBC Radio in April 2023, \u201cWater is the first thing that the Creator made, and it\u2019s the water where we were born. We pray for that water because water is a living thing. It\u2019s not a commodity. We look at it as a spiritual element.\u201d\n\nWater is alive and holds a spirit. It is sacred. It is the lifeblood that flows through lakes, rivers, and oceans, fosters important ecosystems, and has been used for transportation since time immemorial. Therefore, the imagery of two canoes paddling the river of reconciliation side-by-side is significant. As a river has many bends in it, so too does the path of reconciliation. There are seasons of rapid flow and movement forward, and then there are seasons when the flow is slower, and movement forward takes much more effort. It can feel like being trapped in an eddy, where the muddied sluggish water impedes forward movement. The work of paddling through those \u2018seasons\u2019 cannot be done alone.\n\nThe Conference registration is live on Eventbrite and there are links on the Prairie Rivers Reconciliation Circle Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn pages. Sponsorships are still being sought for the conference as it is a free event for anyone to attend and sponsorship is key for that very reason. Sponsorship commitments need to be in by March 14th. If there are organizations or individuals interested in sponsorship opportunities, more information is available by reaching out through social media or by contacting a member. The following are just a few of the businesses and organizations that have representatives in the PRRC: Carlton Trail College, Great Plains College, Mennonite Central Committee, Town of Osler, Town of Hepburn, Town of Rosthern, Station Arts, Wheatland Regional Library, Federated Co-operatives, Dakota Dunes Community Development Corp., and the Wakaw Recorder. Details about breakout sessions for the conference and keynotes are still being finalized.\n\nDiscussion at the meeting involved the housekeeping issues regarding treasurer, tri-chair positions, and administrative assistance for the tri-chairs. A reminder was given that the PRRC will provide funding support for community activities around reconciliation via a simple application process before the event giving a brief description of what it is and how it supports reconciliation. At the next meeting, which will be an in-person one, as many members who can attend as possible will revisit the Vision and Mission Statements, the guidelines, and the Circle\u2019s general definitions and defining statements. The next meeting will be held on March 27 in Warman.\n\nGuest Neal Kewistep joined the meeting to discuss the vision he has for reconciliation moving forward. Kewistep has spent most of his career fostering relationships with government, community-based organizations, Indigenous organizations, and educators. As the former Interim Director of the Population Public Health (PPH) in the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA), his leadership led to increasing the infant and childhood immunization rates to close the gap between the most affluent neighbourhoods and the inner-city neighbourhoods and to address safe housing issues in a new way within the scope of the Public Health Act. He was also the strategic lead for cultural competency and Truth and Reconciliation Commission activities for PPH, which was a role he was proud to take on.\n\nIn addition to his time with the provincial health authority, Mr Kewistep has served as the Director of Operations for the Native Counselling Services of Alberta, as a Community Development Advisor with Yellow Quill First Nation and has provided consulting services to the Saskatoon Tribal Council and the Greater Saskatoon Catholic Schools. He has also served as a board member on the Good Food Junction and the Speakerbox Aboriginal Advisory Group, and as an advisory committee member for the Saskatoon Community Foundation and the Saskatoon Urban Aboriginal Strategy.\n\nReconciliation, he said, has had big moments like the Calls to Action and the discovery of the unmarked graves, where people get invested in reconciliation. The movements this investment has birthed, like Orange Shirt Day and Red Dress Day, while being especially important, are over quickly, but the impacts of residential schools are ongoing for families and individuals. Reconciliation needs to be ongoing. Putting on an orange shirt should not be the end of one\u2019s reconciliation story, it should be the beginning of the conversation\u2026the start when we introduce others to the history, to the new conversations. The reconciliation movement needs to keep going and people need to keep \u201csticking their neck out\u201d for others, and standing up for others, and that is tougher than just putting on an orange shirt. Reconciliation really means achieving the same, not more, just the same.\n\nSaskatchewan, Kewistep said, has a big geography and a small community, and it is a challenge to overcome that big geography. The will to make change, to be welcoming to each other, to hear others, and the willingness to bring people alongside to navigate those twists and turns together needs to continue so the momentum of reconciliation keeps moving forward and does not get stuck in one of those eddies, swirling around and going nowhere. The canoes that are navigating the journey of reconciliation need to be side-by-side not one ahead of the other.\n\nWhen asked for his thoughts on how to encourage and engage more First Nations in the PRRC, Neal said to first determine what value they would gain through their involvement. Then, he said, look to the young people. Show them how they could benefit from the engagement. Young people have a lot of ideas but lack the experience to navigate through systems. Show them opportunities. Show them what they can achieve.\n\n\u00a9 Missinipi Broadcasting Corporation | Site Design by Answers IT Consulting | Powered by WordPress"},

The march, organized by the Native Studies Student Association (NSSA), aimed to bring attention to the issue.\n\nThe march started and ended at Pembina Hall.\nNathan Fung\n\nThe march began in front of Pembina Hall with a smudging ceremony and song where moose hide squares were given out for the Moose Hide campaign, in which Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal men pledge to protect women in their lives. Participants then marched to Rutherford Library and back to Pembina Hall where indigenous leaders and activists shared stories of missing loved ones.\n\nMelanie Dene, a second-year Native Studies student and a member of the Mikisew Cree First Nation, began planning the march in January. She approached the NSSA about creating an event to generate greater awareness for missing and murdered indigenous women on campus.\n\n\u201cI felt that this issue has kind of fallen off the table, out of the public eye, ever since the national inquiry has come about,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I wanted to raise the awareness so that people know that this is still an ongoing issue.\u201d\n\n1,200 felt hearts were strung before the Sweetgrass Bear to represent Canada\u2019s missing and murdered indigenous women.\nNathan Fung\n\nThe march passed 1,201 felt hearts strung up in quad, which represented the 1,200 missing and murdered indigenous women in Canada, with one more added to represent that there is always one more on the go. But while 1,200 is the figure the RCMP arrived at, groups such as the NWAC puts the number closer to 4,000. The one additional heart was meant to signify that there are more victims than those in the report, according to Rhianna Arcand from the NSSA.\n\nDespite the dispute about the numbers, the display in quad was still a profound exhibit, according to Dene.\n\n\u201cAs you\u2019re cutting (the hearts), you\u2019re thinking of those women that have been subjected to this, and when you see it\u2019s there it\u2019s when it hits you\u201d Dene said.\n\nScheduling the march on Valentine\u2019s Day wasn\u2019t just a coincidence. According to Dene, the event was meant as a celebration of love.\n\nAccording to Facebook, almost 170 people joined the march.\nNathan Fung\n\n\u201cWhat we did here on campus was about love, that they will never be forgotten,\u201d Dene said.\n\nMarch attendees included April Wiberg, founder of the Stolen Sisters Awareness Walk and Movement, Marilyn Buffalo, former president of the Native Woman\u2019s Association of Canada (NWAC), and Chief Tony Alexis of Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation.\n\nLike some of the attendees at the march, Dene\u2019s family has been a victim of violence. Her family has lost four relatives, including Shelly Tannis Dene, missing since 2013; Shirley Ann Waquan, missing since 2007; and Amber Alyssa Tuccaro, whose remains were found in 2012.\n\n\u201cWhen it becomes personal, you become more engaged,\u201d Dene said. \u201cYou start to begin to see the racial division in this country, especially in the judicial system that you\u2019ve always thought was there to protect you.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Facebook event page, 166 people attended the rally, which was more than what Dene thought it would be.\n\n\u201cThat made me very happy to see that it\u2019s not our issue anymore,\u201d Dene said. \u201cCanadians need to realize that this isn\u2019t just an indigenous problem, but that this is a Canadian problem.\u201d\n\nNathan Fung\n Share\nFacebook\n \nX\n \nPrint\nNathan Fung\nNathan Fung is a sixth-year political science student and The Gateway's news editor for the 2018-19 year.

She never arrived. Her remains were found 10 months later near the local airport.\n\nTamara Chipman, 22, disappeared in 2005, leaving behind a toddler. \u201cShe\u2019s still missing,\u201d Gladys Radek, her aunt, said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be 11 years in September.\u201d\n\nDozens of Canadian women and girls, most of them indigenous, have disappeared or been murdered near Highway 16, a remote ribbon of asphalt that bisects British Columbia and snakes past thick forests, logging towns and impoverished Indian reserves on its way to the Pacific Ocean. So many women and girls have vanished or turned up dead along one stretch of the road that residents call it the Highway of Tears.\n\nA special unit formed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police officially linked 18 such cases from 1969 to 2006 to this part of the highway and two connecting arteries. More women have vanished since then, and community activists and relatives of the missing say they believe the total is closer to 50. Almost all the cases remain unsolved.\n\nThe Highway of Tears and the disappearances of the indigenous women have become a political scandal in British Columbia. But those cases are just a small fraction of the number who have been murdered or disappeared nationwide. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have officially counted about 1,200 cases over the past three decades, but research by the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada suggests the total number could be as high as 4,000.\n\nIn December, after years of refusal by his conservative predecessor, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a long-awaited national inquiry into the disappearances and murders of indigenous women.\n\nThe inquiry, set to cost 40 million Canadian dollars ($31 million), is part of Trudeau\u2019s promise of a \u201ctotal renewal\u201d of Canada\u2019s relationship with its indigenous citizens, and it comes at a critical time.\n\nAboriginal women and girls make up about 4 percent of the total female population of Canada but 16 percent of all female homicides, according to government statistics.\n\nCarolyn Bennett, the minister of indigenous and northern affairs, has spent months traveling across the country to consult with indigenous communities. During her meetings, families and survivors have complained of racism and sexism by the police, who she said treated the deaths of indigenous women \u201cas inevitable, as if their lives mattered less.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is the uneven application of justice,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nOne reason to doubt the estimate by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, she said, is that the police often immediately deemed the women\u2019s deaths to be suicides, drug overdoses or accidents, over the protests of relatives who suspected foul play. \u201cThere was no investigation,\u201d she said, citing one recent case. \u201cThe file folder\u2019s empty.\u201d\n\nA U.N. report last year described measures by the previous government to protect aboriginal women from harm as \u201cinadequate\u201d and said that the lack of an inquiry into the murders and disappearances constituted \u201cgrave violations\u201d of the women\u2019s human rights. Failures by law enforcement, it added, had \u201cresulted in impunity.\u201d\n\nRadek, a co-founder of Tears4Justice, an advocacy organization, said, \u201cWhen it comes to the missing, racism runs deep.\u201d\n\nThe federal government has allocated 8.4 billion Canadian dollars ($6.4 billion) over five years to aid indigenous communities, which have disproportionately high levels of poverty, incarceration, alcoholism and substance abuse, and often lack basic necessities like safe drinking water.\n\nBennett said the breakdown in aboriginal communities was the product of generations of socioeconomic marginalization and trauma tied to government policies. Particularly damaging was a state-financed, church-run boarding school system for aboriginal children who were forcibly taken from their families by officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Many of the 150,000 children who were sent to residential schools over a century became victims of physical and sexual abuse. The program was fully shut down in the mid-1990s.\n\nCovering 450 miles between the city of Prince George and the Pacific port of Prince Rupert, the Highway of Tears is both a microcosm of Canada\u2019s painful indigenous legacy and a serious test for Trudeau as he tries to repair the country\u2019s relationship with aboriginal people.\n\nOn a recent journey along Highway 16, scenes of stunning wilderness were flecked by indigenous communities reeling from economic decay and the anguished memories of missing and murdered women.\n\nA few miles outside Prince George, the highway plunges into thick forests veined with logging roads and the occasional \u201cmoose crossing\u201d sign. \u201cGirls Don\u2019t Hitchhike on the Highway of Tears,\u201d reads a large yellow billboard alongside the road farther north. \u201cKiller on the Loose!\u201d\n\nAs a bald eagle soared overhead, Brenda Wilson, 49, the Highway of Tears coordinator for Carrier Sekani Family Services and the sister of one of the victims, gestured to the wall of evergreens that flank the road. \u201cThe trees are really dense here, so if you\u2019re looking for someone, it\u2019s pretty hard to find them,\u201d she said, listing the names of several women who are still missing.\n\nThe perils do not stop desperate people from thumbing rides. Just outside the village of Burns Lake, Drucella Joseph, 25, an unemployed aboriginal woman, eagerly climbed into the back of a passing car along with her boyfriend, Corey Coombes. \u201cFriends will drive me when I really need a ride, but other than that, we just hitchhike,\u201d she told the driver. The couple gets by on his disability payments and on donated food from food banks. Neither has a cellphone. When hitchhiking, Coombes says he protects himself by carrying a club or a screwdriver.\n\nBritish Columbia is infamous for serial killers and criminals who often targeted aboriginal women. In 2007, Robert William Pickton, a pig farmer, was convicted of killing six women, though the DNA or remains of 33 women were discovered on his land. Many of them were aboriginal. One of Canada\u2019s youngest serial killers, Cody Legebokoff, was 24 when he was convicted in 2014 of killing four women near the Highway of Tears. David Ramsay, a former Prince George provincial court judge and convicted pedophile, was imprisoned in 2004 for sexually and physically assaulting indigenous girls as young as 12.\n\nAnguished family members said they received little help from the authorities, a sharp contrast to the cases of missing white women. After Chipman vanished in 2005, her aunt, Radek, said the police objected to the family putting up its own missing posters. \u201cThey knew we were searching day and night, and they did nothing to help us,\u201d she said. The next day, she said, a white woman disappeared near Vancouver \u201cand the police were out in the streets putting up posters.\u201d\n\nAfter her daughter Ramona disappeared in 1994, the police refused to act, said Matilda Wilson, a member of the Gitxsan First Nation. \u201cThey gave us all these different excuses that she might be back tomorrow or next week,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThere was no hurry or alarm about it, so we started looking ourselves.\u201d\n\nDespite multiple searches, Wilson, a single mother of six who is now 65, said there was no sign of Ramona until she had been gone for seven months, when Wilson received an anonymous phone call telling her that the girl\u2019s body was near the airport. Police officers searched the area but found nothing, she said. In April 1995, two men riding all-terrain vehicles by the airport discovered Ramona\u2019s remains buried under some trees. Plastic flowers and a glass cross now decorate her grave in a Smithers cemetery, a few blocks from Wilson\u2019s tidy trailer-park home.\n\nAngry with the police for failing to find the teenager or to alert people to the history of missing women near Highway 16, Wilson and her family organized a memorial walk in June 1995 that has become an annual event, garnering attention from the media and inspiring activism from families of other missing women.\n\n\u201cWe want closure, and we\u2019re not going to give up,\u201d Wilson said as she swept leaves from her daughter\u2019s gravestone.\n\nOne recent afternoon, three young aboriginal sisters and their female cousin were walking across the Moricetown Indian Reserve, which abuts the highway. Asked about the Highway of Tears, one of the women, Rochelle Joseph, an unemployed 21-year-old, said the sisters never hitchhiked because they grew up hearing about the victims, including their cousin, Chipman.\n\nStill, the menace of the highway haunts their lives.\n\n\u201cThe stories made us cautious,\u201d Joseph said quietly, voicing their fear of a serial killer lurking behind the steering wheel of any strange car. \u201cHe\u2019s probably still out there.\u201d\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\nHurricane Beryl batters Jamaica as 2 other islands lie in ruin | Honolulu Star-Advertiser\nStar-Advertiser\nSeniors In Alberta Are Eligible For A Free Hearing Test\nConnect Hearing\n|\nSponsored\nLetter: Visitor\u2019s confrontation in Waikiki was unnecessary | Honolulu Star-Advertiser\nStar-Advertiser\nWoman describes captivity in alleged kidnapping | Honolulu Star-Advertiser\nStar-Advertiser\nHere's Why Seniors Are Rushing to Claim Their Free Hearing Tests\nConnect Hearing\n|\nSponsored\nStop scratching these, and try this instead\nDaily Pulse\n|\nSponsored\nAlberta Seniors Born Before 1971 Wanted To Test Hearing Aids\nBest Hearing Aids\n|\nSponsored\nRoofers Tested 17 Gutter Guards\u2026 Here\u2019s What They Discovered\nLeafFilter Partner\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nStop scanning your lottery ticket, do this instead\nDaily Pulse\n|\nSponsored\nFix Grammatical Errors and Typos With this Desktop App\nGrammarly\n|\nSponsored\nInstall Now\nSUBSCRIBER FAVORITES\n1\nTrump widens lead after Biden\u2019s debate debacle, Times/Siena poll finds\n2\nTow company remains silent on overcharges\n3\nGov.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau turned heads on the internet with the latest iteration of the acronym for sexual identities, which includes LGBT\u2026 but doesn't start with it.\n\nTrudeau decided to commemorate the Sisters in Spirit vigil, an event dedicated to people of specific sexual identities who had gone missing or had been murdered.\u00a0\n\n\"People across the country are lighting candles to honour Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people who are missing or have been murdered,\" Trudeau posted on Facebook and Twitter. \"We must continue to work together, raise awareness, and advocate to end this ongoing national tragedy,\" he added with the hashtag \"Sisters In Spirit.\"\n\nCHRISTIAN SCHOLARS RIP PSYCHOLOGY STUDY CLAIMING THAT LGBTQ ACTIVISM POSES NO THREAT TO CHRISTIANS\n\nCarolyn Bennett, the Canadian Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, provided more context in her own message regarding the Sisters In Spirit vigil.\u00a0\n\n\"I urge all Canadians to take time today to honour the Indigenous women, girls and Two Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex and asexual (2SLGBTQQIA+) people who are missing or have been murdered,\" Bennett said in a statement on Monday. \"We offer support to the families and communities who bear the grief of their loss and to the survivors whose lives have been forever changed.\"\n\nWhile most Americans and Canadians may be more familiar with the LGBTQ acronym, the \"2S\" at the beginning of Trudeau's latest version appears to be an effort to prioritize Indigenous people, from whom the \"Two Spirit\" sexual identity \u2013 which involves both male and female aspects \u2013 derives.\n\nCHRISTIAN LEADERS SLAM LUTHERAN DENOMINATION'S TRANSGENDER BISHOP: A \u2018REVOLT\u2019 AGAINST GOD\n\nYet many online influencers didn't pick up what Trudeau was putting down, and they mocked the prime minister for \"button mashing.\"\n\nBritish rapper Nzube Olisaebuka Udezue, best known by his stage name Zuby, quipped, \"Headbutting the keyboard is now a sexuality.\"\n\n\"Is that the actual acronym now or did his cat walk across the keyboard?\" conservative commentator Matt Walsh tweeted to his nearly 700,000 followers.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Trudeau\u2019s button mashing at this point,\" commentator Siraj Hashmi tweeted to his 100,000 followers.\n\n\"Is 2SLGBTQQIA his laptop password?\" video journalist Luke Rudlowski quipped.\n\nTyler O'Neil is an editor at Fox News.

(Rutland Middle School/Contributed)\n\nThe growing synergy between Central Okanagan Public Schools and the local Indigenous culture was reflected in a presentation to school trustees at the board of education meeting on Wednesday ( May 17).\n\nTwo teachers and a student from Mount Boucherie Secondary talked about the significance of the recent Red Dress Day, also recognized as Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Day.\n\nXavier Robinson, an Indigenous student who recently moved to Kelowna from Prince Rupert, spoke about the significance of the colour red, and how it is worn to pause and remember and reflect on the lost lives from the Highway of Tears unsolved Indigenous women murders.\n\n\u201cIt is important to teach others about it,\u201d said Robinson, who was assisted in his presentation by Indigenous Academy teacher Mary Redfearn.\n\nTeacher Carlee Mills-Doherty told trustees about how a seven-part CBC podcast entitled Who Killed Alberta Williams, a 24-year-old woman found dead along the Highway of Tears near Prince Rupert in 1989, has become a teaching tool for her classes since 2016 about Indigenous culture history.\n\nMills-Doherty said the podcast has served as an effective entry point to access different discussion points with students about the history of Indigenous culture in Canada, about bias, justice and fair representation.\n\n\u201cRather than write essays about this, we sit in a circle and allow students to discuss these sometimes difficult social justice issues,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is easy to be overwhelmed by the Indigenous culture topic, but using the podcast as a discussion point eases some of the anxiety students might feel\u2026and help them gain a greater sense of knowledge.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe board of education has declared the month of May as Food Allergy Awareness Month in Central Okanagan Public Schools.\n\n***\n\nTwo noteworthy events came out of the annual general meeting of the B.C. School Trustees Association held in Vancouver.\n\nOne was the election of trustee Julia Fraser as vice-president of the BC Thompson Okanagan branch of the BCSTA.\n\nThe other was an opportunity by the board of education chair Lee-Ann Tiede to meet with the provincial education and childcare minister and address various rising enrolment issues facing Central Okanagan Public Schools.\n\nTiede reported the minister was invited to tour the school district schools at a future date.\n\n***\n\nThe Central Okanagan Bursary and Scholarship Society recently celebrated 52 years of financially assisting local grads in pursuit of their post-secondary education by hosting a donor appreciation tea on May 1.\n\nIn 2002, donation support resulted in 585 bursary and scholarship awards with a value of $545,315.\n\n***\n\nTwo other days of recognition significance acknowledged by the board of education during the month of May \u2013 May 12 is Child Care Provider Appreciation Day and May 12 is Celebration of Women in Math Day.\n\n***\n\nMount Boucherie Secondary will host the school\u2019s first student community visual art show at the Peachland Art Gallery, which opens May 27 and continues until the end of June.\n\nThe art gallery is located at 5684 Beach Ave. in downtown Peachland.\n\n***\n\nCentral Okanagan Public Schools welcomed a group of nine educators from Sweden, who spent a day visiting three schools to gain some professional inspiration and how to learn how to better engage children in reading and writing.\n\nThe Swedish educators met with teachers, sat in on classes, took part in assemblies and attended staff support meetings during their visit.\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n\nAbout the Author: Barry Gerding\n\nSenior regional reporter for Black Press Media in the Okanagan.

(Lexi Bainas/Citizen)\n\nFluttering in the breeze, flashes of red grabbed the eye and wouldn\u2019t let go at Charles Hoey Park in Duncan on Saturday.\n\nCloser examination revealed to the viewer red dresses of all sizes and shapes suspended from the barren February tree branches. It was a disquieting image.\n\nWithout arms, legs, faces and life filling them, the dresses presented a haunting tableau. Here was a graphic representation of loss, tragedy and mystery. Fittingly, here, too, was the faceless anonymity that has for too long hidden away the problem of Canada\u2019s missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and marred any quest for justice in the violence that disproportionately affects them. You must first see them before you can go about fixing the problem.\n\nThis was not Cowichan\u2019s first installation of the REDress Project. Our community certainly isn\u2019t immune to the larger problems facing Indigenous people in this country.\n\nAnd nobody seems as vulnerable as women. Though Indigenous women make up four per cent of Canada\u2019s female population, Kendra Thomas reminded us in her article before the event, 16 per cent of all women murdered in the country between 1980 and 2012 were Indigenous.\n\nAnother tragic statistic: In 2014 RCMP identified 1,181 missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nAs the REDress Project hung in the park, Cowichan Tribes hosted their 1st Annual Walk for Missing and Murdered Men, Women and Children. A big crowd turned out for this inaugural event, again showing just how many people, right here in the Cowichan Valley, are affected by this ongoing problem.\n\nMaking it visible, acknowledging it is there, is just the first step.\n\nThe next steps are many and complicated. But we must put one foot in front of the other and keep moving.\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tEditorial: Bypass of Duncan corridor not worth it\n\t\tDuncan to get new $7-million urgent and primary care centre\n\t\tPolice ask for help to find man missing from Youbou\n\t\tBig Brothers Big Sisters Cowichan chapter forced to shut down\n\t\tCongratulations to the Cowichan Secondary Class of 2024\nFacebook Comments (0) \nTODAY IN B.C.\n\nThere are no items to show.\n\n \nCowichan Valley Citizen\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nAdvertising\nSupport Centre\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nJoin our Team\nNews\nLocal News\nNewsletters\nSubscribe\nToday in BC\nCanadian News\nWorld News\nEntertainment\nSports\nBusiness\nTrending Now\nOpinion\nSubmit News Tips\nNeighbours\nAlberni Valley News\nParksville Qualicum Beach News\nTofino-Ucluelet Westerly News\nChemainus Valley Courier\nLadysmith Chronicle\nLake Cowichan Gazette\nNanaimo News Bulletin\nMore\nOur Community\nPublic Notices\nVideo\nPhoto Galleries\nTravel\nWest Coast Traveller\nCannabis\nToday's Home\nPodcasts\nFood\nLife\nContact Us\nContests\nPuzzles\nContests\nShop\nImpress Stories\nSavvy Shopper\nImpress TV\nAdd Your Business\nE-Editions\nClassifieds\nAll Classifieds\nBook a Print Ad\nAuto\nToday's Drive\nAuto Showcase\nJobs\nLocalWork\nJoin Our Team\nObituaries\nCelebrations of Life\nFuneral Care Services\nIn Memory\nPlace an Obituary\nGood News\nLocal Good News\nSocial Media\nCowichan Valley Live\nToday in BC\nYoutube\nI love British Columbia\nI love Alberta\nI love Nunavut\nI love Yukon\nI love Northwest Territories\n\u00a9 2024 Cowichan Valley Citizen and Black Press Media Publications Contact"},

MDT\nShare\nLETHBRIDGE -\n\n Adding to a Canada-wide movement, Lethbridge remembered and honoured missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people on Friday.\n\n\"When we think of the day, it's not a celebration, but it's an opportunity to create awareness and bring the community together in a positive way,\" said Charlene Bruised Head-Mountain Horse, the Indigenous relations advisor with the City of Lethbridge.\n\nRed Dress Day is meant to bring awareness to, and calls for all Canadians to speak out on, violence against Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people.\n\nRELATED STORIES\nHundreds march as Red Dress Day is marked across Manitoba\nSaskatoon marks Red Dress Day 2023\n\nSelena Medicine Shield spoke and danced at a fireside connection hosted in Galt Gardens on Friday afternoon in honour of her grandmother, whose murder in 1999 remains unsolved.\n\n\"To me, it is being able to be a voice for all Indigenous people who have gone missing or have been murdered, especially my grandmother and just being able to represent her and tell her story,\" Medicine Shield said.\n\nEmpty red garments -- a symbol for each life that has been lost -- surrounded the fireside connection.\n\nThe event, hosted by the City of Lethbridge, Alberta Health Services and other community partners, featured drumming, dancing and the sharing of memories and stories.\n\nDespite an increased awareness and an extensive national inquiry, Indigenous leaders say the situation remains a crisis.\n\n\"People like to believe that it's not in our town, it's not in our city, it's not happening to us, but we need to make people aware that it is,\" said Echo Nowak, an Indigenous relations specialist with the City of Lethbridge and co-organizer of the fireside connection.\n\n\"It is our sisters, our brothers, our family members that are going missing and we need to do something about it and the only way we can do something about it is by coming together as a community and making our voices heard.\"\n\nIt's not known exactly how many Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people have been murdered or have disappeared, but the Native Women's Association of Canada believes it's at least 4,000.\n\nAs part of the work plan, a toolkit was developed by the City of Lethbridge to help residents and community members learn more about the traditional concepts of family and community life for Niitsitapiiaakiiks (Blackfoot women), Saip\u00e1\u00ed\u2019tapiiaakiiks (Indigenous, non-Blackfoot women) and two-spirit people.\n\nThe toolkit features actions individuals, businesses and media partners can take to support Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people in the community.\n\n\"There's different opportunities to lobby leadership, empower our local circles,\" Bruised Head-Mountain Horse said.\n\nA few dozen people gathered on Friday and while Medicine Shield says the support is great to see, she hopes one day she won't have to attend these kinds of ceremonies.\n\n\"In the future, I don't want my kids to be afraid to walk to the store or go to a friend's house when they are alone,\" she said.\n\n\"I want them to be safe.\"\u00a0\n\nRed

Working with us ahead of time as opposed to just laying it on us a week before the day, I think would be super helpful.\u201d\n\nPettit has tried her best to accommodate last-minute orders, but she and other members of the Indigenous business community see the trend as a sign of how much more work corporate Canada has to do to turn support for Indigenous communities into a 365-day-a-year effort.\n\nWhile many businesses encourage staff to don orange shirts \u2014 a tradition started by residential school survivor Phyllis Webstad in 2013 \u2014 or to sell wares in the bright hue on Sept. 30, those efforts quickly fade. Companies often don\u2019t do much more to elevate Indigenous voices and causes.\n\n\u201cIt is positive that we are seeing education happen and awareness-building happen, but it can be quite triggering and harmful for Indigenous Peoples who see it as one day of performative action and nothing throughout the rest of the year,\u201d said Tabatha Bull, president and chief executive of the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business (CCAB).\n\nBull and Pettit say if an employer is looking to make a mark on truth and reconciliation goals, they should also be doing that work all year round.\n\nThose efforts should begin with educating staff about both long-standing and new traumas Indigenous Peoplesface and how to support those affected.\n\nPettit recallsbeing at work in 2021, when the remains of 215 children were found at a former residential school site in British Columbia.\n\n\u201cMy boss at the time was like, \u2018Oh, well, everybody knew about that already\u2019 and just like kind of brushed it off, but I was feeling very emotional that day for obvious reasons, so there\u2019s tons of work that has to be done,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s borne out in studies too.\n\nA 2021 report from equity organization Catalyst Canada found about 52 per cent of the 86 Indigenous respondents surveyed are \u201con guard\u201d at work and about 60 per cent feel psychologically unsafe on the job.\n\nThe study was based on a survey of 820 Canadian workers from various under-represented groups, but Catalyst isolated results from Indigenous respondents for this report because their need to feel on guard was so significant.\n\nKrystal Abotossaway, president of the Indigenous Professional Association of Canada, said she has seen more companies move toward reflecting on what they can do to improve their corporate culture and support Indigenous communities in recent years.\n\nLand acknowledgments, which note which Indigenous Peoples lived and took care of a site events are being held on, are an increasingly common and good start, she said.\n\nBull counts at least 200 companies, including Bank of Montreal, Uber, Walmart and Rogers, as members of the CCAB\u2019s Progressive Aboriginal Relation program \u2014 an initiative helping them build cultural awareness and make progress on reconciliation plans.\n\nOthers have yet to take on such work. Bull thinks they\u2019re slower to act because they feel overwhelmed and afraid of having difficult conversations.\n\n\u201cSome corporations are just not even knowing what the right question is to ask,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we need to move beyond that, if we\u2019re going to really progress as a country.\u201d\n\nAbotossaway said they can start by marking other Indigenous days and use them as an opportunity to educate.\n\nAmong those she suggested are Red Dress Day, which commemorates the lives of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, and International Inuit Day, National Indigenous Peoples Day and Louis Riel Day, which celebrates the life of the late M\u00e9tis leader.\n\nThe efforts shouldn\u2019t stop there, she added. Companies should reflect on how their governance structures, hiring policies, talent pipelines and workforce education programs align with Indigenous needs, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of learning and development content come out, but that\u2019s usually just one course and it might be just an hour long,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIs it mandatory or is it not mandatory? And then how many of your employees or workforce are participating in it?\u201d\n\nAbotossaway and Bull agree any corporate actions on National Day for Truth and Reconciliation or other days should involve Indigenous Peoples at every step \u2014 even if the action is selling orange apparel.\n\nBull said, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to create an orange shirt, ensure that you\u2019re working with an Indigenous artist, ensure that the Orange Shirt Society or an Indigenous organization benefits from that and you\u2019re not making a profit off of the orange shirt or Sept. 30.\u201d\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 30, 2022.\n\nCompanies in this story: (TSX:BMO, TSX:RCI)\n\nShare this article\nSUGGESTED ARTICLES\nONTARIO NEWS\nNew centre in the works to track Indigenous data on businesses, land and resources\n\nOTTAWA \u2014 A new institute is in the works that would track Indigenous economic prosperity in Canada\u2026\n\nONTARIO NEWS\nRCMP adds ribbon skirt to uniform in effort to build bridges with Indigenous people\n\nOTTAWA \u2014 The RCMP has added a traditional Indigenous ribbon skirt to its uniform.

PHOTO BY JUSTIN TANG /THE CANADIAN PRESS\nArticle content\n\nThe federal Treasury Board Secretariat decreed last week that civil servants would be required to spend a minimum of three days a week in the office. That\u2019s a surprise. The pandemic is over. Most people assumed federal public servants were already back in the office \u2013 full time.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nUnsurprisingly, there\u2019s pushback from the unions.\n\nSharon DeSousa, National Executive Vice-President of the Public Service Alliance of Canada told an Ottawa radio station that, \u201cWithout a doubt, we are going to take legal recourse and we will be fighting it,\u201d she said.\n\nWill they strike? If so, will they picket their workplace \u2013 which in this case is their own homes?\nEmployers \u2013 that is, taxpayers \u2013 have every right to tell workers where they should report to work.\n\nIn many cases, work from home is effective. That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case in the public service, where the government has added 100,000 employees since 2015, with nearly 70% of that growth happening since 2019 \u2013 coincidentally when the pandemic hit and workers went home.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe more civil servants work from home, the more civil servants we need, which suggests a productivity problem.\n\nThis is a classic case of do as I say, not as I do. It will be hard for the government to argue that working from home is inefficient, since Parliament itself is in a hybrid mode.\n\nIn February, several Liberal MPs were quoted in the online publication Politico saying they don\u2019t intend to return to Parliament Hill any time soon, preferring the flexibility of working from home.\n\nToronto area MP Nate Erskine-Smith said he spends a lot time in his constituency. \u201cIf you want serious people, younger people, people who want to be good spouses and be good parents to do this job \u2026 there has to be a certain level of flexibility to work remotely.\u201d\n\nIf Parliament returned to a full in-person proceeding, \u201cthere\u2019s no chance I\u2019d run again,\u201d he said.\n\nWell, so long. Farewell. Auf wiedersehen and goodbye, Mr. Erskine-Smith. It used to be an honour to stand in the hallowed halls of the House of Commons and vote on behalf of your constituents.\n\nGreat leaders lead by example \u2013 and not in their pyjamas. If you want civil servants to return to work, MPs must show the way.\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nStop Buying Lottery Tickets & Start Doing This Instead!\nYukon\n|\nSponsored\nClick Here\nCops hunt for suspect after child sexually assaulted\nWinnipeg Sun\nManitoba RCMP shoot and kill man who was allegedly assaulting a woman\nWinnipeg Sun\nCasinos Hate You Doing This.

RCMP say Chelsey Heron (Quaw) was found dead in a wooded area of the Saik'uz First Nation in Vanderhoof \u2013 Nov 6, 2023\nLEAVE A COMMENT\nSHARE THIS ITEM ON FACEBOOK\nSHARE THIS ITEM ON TWITTER\nSEND THIS PAGE TO SOMEONE VIA EMAIL\nSEE MORE SHARING OPTIONS\nDESCREASE ARTICLE FONT SIZE\nINCREASE ARTICLE FONT SIZE\n\nWarning: This story contains details that may upset and trigger some readers. Anyone affected by the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQIA+ people needing support can call a national toll free crisis line at 1-844-413-6649.\n\nBritish Columbia\u2019s civilian-led police watchdog has launched an investigation into the death of a beloved Saik\u2019uz First Nation woman whose remains were found, tragically, in a wooded area of the community last month.\n\nChelsey Heron (Quaw), 29, was last seen leaving her father\u2019s house on the nation near Vanderhoof, B.C. on Oct. 11 \u2014 the same day Vanderhoof RCMP were called to conduct a wellness check on Chelsey at a private home.\n\nAccording to B.C.\u2019s Independent Investigations Office (IIO), Mounties took steps to find the woman, but were unsuccessful.\n\nChelsey was found dead on Nov. 5.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n1:49\nNational Day of Action for MMIWG\n\nLater that month, the watchdog received several concerns from the public about the police response to the request for a wellness check. The IIO doesn\u2019t use victims\u2019 names in its releases in order to protect the privacy.\n\n\u201cWhat we would look at in a case like this is, was there a failure of police to take the appropriate steps in the circumstances that they were facing?\u201d explained Ronald MacDonald, IIO chief civilian director.\n\n\u201cThe police have a duty at law to protect human life, so if they\u2019re given information about a situation where someone\u2019s life may be impacted or in danger, they have a duty to take reasonable steps to do what they can to help that person.\u201d\n\n2:02\nRed Dress Day honours memory of MMIWG2S\n\nThe IIO is charged with investigating what role any police action \u2014 or inaction \u2014 has had when a civilian is seriously hurt or killed in relation to a police-involved incident. If it believes a criminal offence has been committed, it may refer the matter to the BC Prosecution Service.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMacDonald said he hopes to have findings in this case within six months.\n\nEdmonton's breaking news sent to your email as it happens.\n\nThe BC Coroners Service and RCMP are still conducting their own investigations into Chelsey\u2019s death.\n\n2:03\nSewing red ribbon skirts in honour of MMIWG\n\nIn November, after Chelsey\u2019s remains were found, her mother Pam issued a public statement described her daughter as \u201cloved cared for deeply by her family, friends and community.\u201d\n\n\u201cChelsey had the most amazing spirit, beautiful strength and independence. Most importantly, she had an incredible impact on those in her life. We will not rest until we get answers,\u201d Pam said.\n\nIn previous comments, Pam has said Chelsey was deeply connected to her culture and to nature, and loved to walk her dog Pepper outdoors.\n\nSaik\u2019uz First Nation Chief Priscilla Mueller referred a request for comment on this story to Mary Teegee, director of child and family services at Carrier Sekani Family Services. Teegee was not available on Friday.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n7:03\nCanada begins consultations on alert system for missing Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people\n\nChelsey was the second citizen of Saik\u2019uz First Nation to go missing in 2023.\n\nJay Raphael went missing on Feb. 26, with his disappearance described as \u201cvery uncharacteristic\u201d by his family.\n\nChelsey\u2019s family repeatedly advocated for support finding Raphael, whose whereabouts are still unknown, using attention around Chelsey\u2019s disappearance as a platform.\n\n5:17\nOrganization launches scholarship ensuring gender equality\n\nMeanwhile, Carrier Sekani Family Services and the Highway of Tears Governing Body have called on the B.C. government to rename Highway 16, the \u201cHighway of Hope.\u201d More than 40 women and girls, mostly First Nations, have gone missing or been murdered along the notorious 725-kilometre stretch of road, which passes through Vanderhoof and is sometimes called the Highway of Tears.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis month, Canada launched public consultations on developing a public alert system for missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people (MMIWG2S), in recognition of the crisis of violence and crime that has disproportionately affected them for generations.\u00a0Earlier this year, the House of Commons unanimously backed a motion declaring the deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls a Canada-wide emergency.\n\nIn 2019, a national inquiry into the MMIWG2S crisis\u00a0found more than six in 10 Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse people have experienced physical or sexual violence. They are also 12 times more likely to be missing or murdered than non-Indigenous women.\n\nAnyone with information on Chelsey\u2019s death is asked to contact the IIO\u2019s witness line at 1-855-446-8477 or fill out the contact form on the watchdog\u2019s website.\n\n\u2014\u00a0with files from Catherine Urquhart\n\nThe Hope for Wellness Help Line offers culturally competent counselling and crisis intervention to all Indigenous peoples experiencing trauma, distress, strong emotions and painful memories.

Canadian Press\n\nNow Showing\n2:57\n\nCorporate Canada\u2019s long road ahead for Indigenous economic inclus...\n\nUp Next\n7:20\n\nHow Raven Indigenous Capital Partners is closing the funding gap\n\nChelsee Pettit spent much of\u00a0the\u00a0summer collaborating with designers to create and manufacture apparel reflective of\u00a0the\u00a0Indigenous values she hoped would be on people's minds when Canada marks its second National Day for Truth and Reconciliation.\n\nBut in\u00a0the\u00a0days leading up to Sept. 30, she noticed many companies had not had\u00a0the\u00a0same forethought and were scrambling to place bulk orders with her store, Aaniin.\n\n\"It's just a little funny how last-minute other organizations that are all non-Indigenous are, and they're pushing that (work) back onto Indigenous people,\" said Pettit, an Anishinaabe woman.\n\n\"We're not like big box stores that just have disposable T-shirts and are at everybody's beck and call. Working with us ahead of time as opposed to just laying it on us a week before\u00a0the\u00a0day, I think would be super helpful.\"\n\nPettit has tried her best to accommodate last-minute orders, but she and other members of\u00a0the\u00a0Indigenous business community see\u00a0the\u00a0trend as a sign of how much more work corporate Canada has to do to turn support for Indigenous communities into a 365-day-a-year effort.\n\nWhile many businesses encourage staff to don orange shirts \u2014 a tradition started by residential school survivor Phyllis Webstad in 2013 \u2014 or to sell wares in\u00a0the\u00a0bright hue on Sept. 30, those efforts quickly fade. Companies often don't do much more to elevate Indigenous voices and causes.\n\n\"It is positive that we are seeing education happen and awareness-building happen, but it can be quite triggering and harmful for Indigenous Peoples who see it as one day of performative action and nothing throughout\u00a0the\u00a0rest of\u00a0the\u00a0year,\" said Tabatha Bull, president and chief executive of\u00a0the\u00a0Canadian\u00a0Council for Aboriginal Business (CCAB).\n\nBull and Pettit say if an employer is looking to make a mark on truth and reconciliation goals, they should also be doing that work all year round.\n\nThose efforts should begin with educating staff about both long-standing and new traumas Indigenous Peoples\u00a0face and how to support those affected.\n\nPettit recalls\u00a0being at work in 2021, when\u00a0the\u00a0remains of 215 children were found at a former residential school site in British Columbia.\n\n\"My boss at\u00a0the\u00a0time was like, 'Oh, well, everybody knew about that already' and just like kind of brushed it off, but I was feeling very emotional that day for obvious reasons, so there's tons of work that has to be done,\" she said.\n\nThat's borne out in studies too.\n\nA 2021 report from equity organization Catalyst Canada found about 52 per cent of\u00a0the\u00a086 Indigenous respondents surveyed are \u201con guard\u201d at work and about 60 per cent feel psychologically unsafe on\u00a0the\u00a0job.\n\nThe\u00a0study was based on a survey of 820\u00a0Canadian\u00a0workers from various under-represented groups, but Catalyst isolated results from Indigenous respondents for this report because their need to feel on guard was so significant.\n\nKrystal Abotossaway, president of\u00a0the\u00a0Indigenous Professional Association of Canada, said she has seen more companies move toward reflecting on what they can do to improve their corporate culture and support Indigenous communities in recent years.\n\nLand acknowledgments, which note which Indigenous Peoples lived and took care of a site events are being held on, are an increasingly common and good start, she said.\n\nBull counts at least 200 companies, including Bank of Montreal, Uber, Walmart and Rogers, as members of\u00a0the\u00a0CCAB's Progressive Aboriginal Relation program \u2014 an initiative helping them build cultural awareness and make progress on reconciliation plans.\n\nOthers have yet to take on such work. Bull thinks they're slower to act because they feel overwhelmed and afraid of having difficult conversations.\n\n\"Some corporations are just not even knowing what\u00a0the\u00a0right question is to ask,\" she said. \"I think we need to move beyond that, if we're going to really progress as a country.\"\n\nAbotossaway said they can start by marking other Indigenous days and use them as an opportunity to educate.\n\nAmong those she suggested are Red Dress Day, which commemorates\u00a0the\u00a0lives of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, and International Inuit Day, National Indigenous Peoples Day and Louis Riel Day, which celebrates\u00a0the\u00a0life of\u00a0the\u00a0late M\u00e9tis leader.\n\nThe\u00a0efforts shouldn't stop there, she added. Companies should reflect on how their governance structures, hiring policies, talent pipelines and workforce education programs align with Indigenous needs, she said.\n\n\"We've seen a lot of learning and development content come out, but that's usually just one course and it might be just an hour long,\" she said.\n\n\"Is it mandatory or is it not mandatory? And then how many of your employees or workforce are participating in it?\"\n\nAbotossaway and Bull agree any corporate actions on National Day for Truth and Reconciliation or other days should involve Indigenous Peoples at every step \u2014 even if\u00a0the\u00a0action is selling orange apparel.\n\nBull said, \"If you're going to create an orange shirt, ensure that you're working with an Indigenous artist, ensure that\u00a0the\u00a0Orange Shirt Society or an Indigenous organization benefits from that and you're not making a profit off of\u00a0the\u00a0orange shirt or Sept. 30.\"\n\nSubscribe to BNN Bloomberg Newsletters BNN Bloomberg Personalities Weekly Guest Schedule Channel Guide Contact Us Privacy Policy Accessibility Political Ad Registry Terms & Conditions FAQ\n\u00a9 2024All Rights Reserved\nCTV News Sites"},

By participating in the project, Bistodeau hopes to get the word out about the issue of human trafficking and help people realize that it happens in Minnesota and even Brainerd.\n\nJordan Christian, prevention educator and advocate at Sexual Assault Services, was on hand to answer questions and promote the project, too.\n\n\u201cI had a couple of students come up, and they were like, \u2018That\u2019s happening in our country?\u2019\u201d Christian said. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Yeah, this happens in our country; it happens in our community.\u201d\n\nPackets of red sand sat on tables outside the college\u2019s front doors Wednesday, inviting students, staff and visitors to learn about the initiative and sprinkle their own sand in and around the sidewalk cracks.\n\nRed sand art projects were on display inside, along with posters bringing awareness to sexual assault, picturing people reiterating common excuses for the crime.\n\nCentral Lakes College looked to raise awareness on Wednesday, May 1, 2024, about human trafficking and the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women by spreading red sand through the cracks of the sidewalks and hanging red dresses around campus.Tim Speier / Brainerd Dispatch\n\nIn a video created to promote the Red Sand Project, Kate LePage, a regional navigator for Safe Harbor in central Minnesota, spoke of what constitutes trafficking.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about what commercial sexual exploitation is, it\u2019s the exchange of something of value or the promise of something of value for a sexual act,\u201d she said. \u201cThat something of value can be money \u2026 transportation, food, drugs, alcohol, housing. It can even be intangible \u2014 status in a community. Anything that\u2019s perceived of value qualifies under that commercial sexual exploitation and then sex trafficking.\u201d\n\nThere is a grooming process, she said, often initiated online or by someone who is known to the victim.\n\n... It\u2019s time that we bring attention to those that have been missing and those that have been murdered.\nMary Sam, dean of student equity and inclusion at CLC\n\nCrow Wing County Sheriff\u2019s Office Lt. Craig Katzenberger spoke in the video of law enforcement\u2019s goal to make their departments aware of the potential of trafficking and how to look for red flags.\n\n\u201cIt could involve just short-term trafficking at hotels and motels. It could be several young girls in a vehicle with maybe an older male,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there\u2019s any red flags that come up, just to separate the individuals, ask some questions and just get the stories from everyone involved.\u201d\n\nMORE BY THERESA BOURKE\nSchool board aims to nix phones by 2025\n21h ago\nBourke's Bookshelf: Grilled cheese and a stolen hoodie\n1d ago\nBPU union files intent to strike\n2d ago\n\nBack outside at CLC, red dresses hung from trees outside CLC, as the event worked in conjunction with the REDress Project as well. Every year on May 5, Red Dress Day brings awareness to the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women epidemic in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nMary Sam, dean of student equity and inclusion at CLC, spoke to that epidemic in the video.\n\n\u201cIn Ojibwe culture, we\u2019re taught that the color red represents the relationship between the physical world and spiritual world and our connection to our ancestors,\u201d Sam said. \u201cMissing and Murdered Indigenous Women is near and dear to my heart as a grandmother of a missing and murdered young woman \u2014 my granddaughter in 2016.\u201d\n\nNative American women are up to 10 times more likely to be murdered or sexually assaulted than white women, Sam added.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s wrong, and it\u2019s time that we bring attention to those that have been missing and those that have been murdered,\u201d she said in the video. \u201cWe are their voices, right?

Working with us ahead of time as opposed to just laying it on us a week before the day, I think would be super helpful.\u201d\n\nPettit has tried her best to accommodate last-minute orders, but she and other members of the Indigenous business community see the trend as a sign of how much more work corporate Canada has to do to turn support for Indigenous communities into a 365-day-a-year effort.\n\nWhile many businesses encourage staff to don orange shirts \u2014 a tradition started by residential school survivor Phyllis Webstad in 2013 \u2014 or to sell wares in the bright hue on Sept. 30, those efforts quickly fade. Companies often don\u2019t do much more to elevate Indigenous voices and causes.\n\n\u201cIt is positive that we are seeing education happen and awareness-building happen, but it can be quite triggering and harmful for Indigenous Peoples who see it as one day of performative action and nothing throughout the rest of the year,\u201d said Tabatha Bull, president and chief executive of the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business (CCAB).\n\nTop Stories\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nBull and Pettit say if an employer is looking to make a mark on truth and reconciliation goals, they should also be doing that work all year round.\n\nThose efforts should begin with educating staff about both long-standing and new traumas Indigenous Peoplesface and how to support those affected.\n\nPettit recallsbeing at work in 2021, when the remains of 215 children were found at a former residential school site in British Columbia.\n\n\u201cMy boss at the time was like, \u2018Oh, well, everybody knew about that already\u2019 and just like kind of brushed it off, but I was feeling very emotional that day for obvious reasons, so there\u2019s tons of work that has to be done,\u201d she said.\n\nThat\u2019s borne out in studies too.\n\nA 2021 report from equity organization Catalyst Canada found about 52 per cent of the 86 Indigenous respondents surveyed are \u201con guard\u201d at work and about 60 per cent feel psychologically unsafe on the job.\n\nThe study was based on a survey of 820 Canadian workers from various under-represented groups, but Catalyst isolated results from Indigenous respondents for this report because their need to feel on guard was so significant.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nKrystal Abotossaway, president of the Indigenous Professional Association of Canada, said she has seen more companies move toward reflecting on what they can do to improve their corporate culture and support Indigenous communities in recent years.\n\nLand acknowledgments, which note which Indigenous Peoples lived and took care of a site events are being held on, are an increasingly common and good start, she said.\n\nBull counts at least 200 companies, including Bank of Montreal, Uber, Walmart and Rogers, as members of the CCAB\u2019s Progressive Aboriginal Relation program \u2014 an initiative helping them build cultural awareness and make progress on reconciliation plans.\n\nOthers have yet to take on such work. Bull thinks they\u2019re slower to act because they feel overwhelmed and afraid of having difficult conversations.\n\n\u201cSome corporations are just not even knowing what the right question is to ask,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we need to move beyond that, if we\u2019re going to really progress as a country.\u201d\n\nAbotossaway said they can start by marking other Indigenous days and use them as an opportunity to educate.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nAmong those she suggested are Red Dress Day, which commemorates the lives of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, and International Inuit Day, National Indigenous Peoples Day and Louis Riel Day, which celebrates the life of the late Metis leader.\n\nThe efforts shouldn\u2019t stop there, she added. Companies should reflect on how their governance structures, hiring policies, talent pipelines and workforce education programs align with Indigenous needs, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of learning and development content come out, but that\u2019s usually just one course and it might be just an hour long,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIs it mandatory or is it not mandatory? And then how many of your employees or workforce are participating in it?\u201d\n\nAbotossaway and Bull agree any corporate actions on National Day for Truth and Reconciliation or other days should involve Indigenous Peoples at every step \u2014 even if the action is selling orange apparel.\n\nBull said, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to create an orange shirt, ensure that you\u2019re working with an Indigenous artist, ensure that the Orange Shirt Society or an Indigenous organization benefits from that and you\u2019re not making a profit off of the orange shirt or Sept. 30.\u201d\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 30, 2022.\n\nCompanies in this story: (TSX:BMO, TSX:RCI)\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nRoofers Tested 17 Gutter Guards\u2026 Here\u2019s What They Discovered\nThe Actual Cost of Gutter Guards in 2024 May Surprise You\nLeafFilter Partner\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nJustin Trudeau to call vote on contentious capital gains tax hike this week\nFinancial Post\nMore and more people are discovering they are 'rich' in the eyes of Liberals\nFinancial Post\nHeart Surgeon Shares 3 Min Routine For Daily Bowel Movements\nGundry MD\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nOne Teaspoon Every Night Burns Body Fat Like Never Before, You Will Fit In Your Pants Again!\nBurn Belly Fat\n|\nSponsored\nCanadians Born 1944 - 1983 Could Get This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nAlberta Seniors Born Before 1971 Wanted To Test Hearing Aids\nBest Hearing Aids\n|\nSponsored\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\n\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

(Carrier Sekani Child & Family Services photo)\nExpand\n\nFirst Nations leaders and the parents of two missing members of the Saik\u2019uz First Nation are calling for more resources and action to find the missing young people. Indigenous leaders and family spoke at a press conference in Vanderhoof today to request information and action by government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been 24 days since my daughter Chelsea went missing, and we still don\u2019t have any answers,\u201d said a tearful Pam Heron, mother of missing woman Chelsey Quaw (Heron).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying as hard as I can. I have to fight just because his boys deserve to know where he\u2019s at,\u201d said Angie Raphael, mother of missing man Jay Raphael.\n\nChelsey Quaw (Heron) and Jay Preston Raphael are both missing members of the Saik\u2019uz First Nation, located 120 km west of Prince George, just outside Vanderhoof, B.C. and just 14 km south of Highway 16.\n\nHighway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert is known as the Highway of Tears, due to the high number of missing and murdered women in the area, the majority of whom over the years have been Indigenous.\n\nCommunity leaders also shed tears as they spoke at a press conference in Vanderhoof, urging for more resources to be brought to the investigation into the two missing young people.\n\nChief Priscilla Mueller of Saik\u2019uz First Nation thanked all the volunteers who came to participate in the search so far, and said the Saik\u2019uz community had taken the search to Prince George and Vanderhoof as well.\n\nBut she said more needs to be done and more resources are needed.\n\n\u201cThere is only so much the local RCMP can do,\u201d she said, noting they need help from government.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not too sure how we\u2019re going to move forward with the search,\u201d she said.\n\nMary Teegee, executive director of Carrier Sekani Child & Family Service expressed frustration at the lack of action on the 33 recommendations from the 2006 Highway of Tears Symposium Report, which she was also a part of.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m upset that we have to be here again,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere are things we need to think about as a society, how much value are we placing on our Indigenous women, our Indigenous men.\u201d\n\nShe called for more action from both the government, law enforcement and the media to help draw attention to the ongoing issues surrounding missing and murdered Indigenous women and the Highway of Tears. She also referenced the missing women in Manitoba whose remains are believed to be in a landfill.\n\n\u201cIn Canada we\u2019re having to check the landfills for bodies of our missing Indigenous women. Think about that. As a society we have to do better.\u201d\n\nChelsey Quaw is a 29-year-old Indigenous woman with brown hair, brown eyes who vanished from her community last month.\n\nShe stands five feet, 10 inches tall and weighs about 120 pounds. She was possibly wearing blue jeans and a purple winter jacket when she went missing in the early morning hours of Oct. 11, 2023 from a residence on the Saik\u2019uz First Nation.\n\nSeveral search and rescue teams as well as community groups formed search parties to look for Quaw with no results.\n\nJay Preston Raphael has been missing from the community just over eight months.\n\nRaphael is a 28-year-old male with black hair and brown eyes, and unique tattoos on his neck, chest and arm.\n\nHe is five feet, nine inches tall and weighs approximately 143 pounds.\n\nRaphael was last seen on Feb. 25, 2023 at Saik\u2019uz First Nation wearing a black coat, blue jeans black runners and a baseball hat.\n\nSaik\u2019uz First Nation has an on-reserve population of about 400.\n\nLeaders also frequently referenced other missing women from the area. This included Mackie Basil, missing from Tl\u2019azt\u2019en Nation Nation, since 2013, Bonnie Joseph of Yekooche First Nation, missing from near Vanderhoof since 2008, Ramona Wilson of Gitxan First Nation, who went missing in 1994 and whose remains were found near Smithers in 1995. Her murder remains unsolved. They also mentioned Madison Scott and the ongoing search for justice in her case. Scott had been missing since 2011 and her remains were found earlier this year near Vanderhoof, but no charges have yet been laid as the investigation is ongoing.\n\nAnyone with any information can contact Vanderhoof RCMP at 250-567-2222 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.\n\nREAD MORE: Mother of missing Vanderhoof woman says she would never just take off\n\nREAD MORE: RCMP renews public assistance call to locate missing man\n\nREAD MORE: Search continues for missing Vanderhoof woman Chelsey Quaw\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n\nAbout the Author: Ruth Lloyd\n\nI moved back to my hometown of Williams Lake after living away and joined the amazing team at the Williams Lake Tribune in 2021.\nRead more\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tNorthwest B.C. author pens book about logging\n\t\tTeen dies after overdose involving fentanyl in northern B.C.: RCMP\n\t\t'You shattered her life': 3 years for sexual assault of young Kelowna woman\n\t\tMan dies throwing candy during Alberta Canada Day parade\n\t\tTom Havard is this year\u2019s Hudson Bay Mountain Legendary Local\nFacebook Comments (0) \nMan who stabbed Mexican tourist at B.C.

Merchant and Kura were in Prince George on Wednesday.Brent Braaten, Photographer\n\nHe might forget the words he wants to use to express himself and can't recall the name of a friend he just mentioned moments ago but Highway of Tears walker Brett Merchant, 56, never loses focus on why he's on the road.\n\n\"This is for the young women who are missing and murdered on the Highway of Tears,\" said the Kimberley resident on Wednesday afternoon as he stopped in Prince George during his solo trek from the B.C-Alberta border on Highway 16 to Haida Gwaii. He began the 1,236 kilometre journey on Sept. 1 at noon.\n\n\"Yes, thanks, I hear 'you're a great guy, good job for doing this' and thanks again very much but that's not what this is about for me - it's about keeping the awareness going for the safety of aboriginal women,\" said Merchant, who suffers from SLE lupus, early onset dementia and diabetes. He knew if he didn't do something quick, he would lose the physical ability to do anything at all.\n\nHe watched the Highway of Tears documentary on Nextflix recently and decided to go, leaving his care home and not knowing if he has a home to go back to when the time comes to return to Kimberley in the new year.\n\nMerchant brought Kura, his 10-year-old Siberian husky-wolf cross, who is in perfect health.\n\nMerchant's veterinarian OK'd Kura for the trip before they left, and again here in Prince George.\n\nThe vet will be back in a month to check on Kura again.\n\nMerchant, who has a tremor that affects his whole body continuously, is planning on ending his journey in Haida Gwaii on Dec. 31 at midnight, because then he starts the new year off knowing he completed the journey.\n\n\"Kura and I, we're winter. It was too hot yesterday (it reached about 20 degrees and was sunny) and when it rained all week before that was OK, we just kept walking because it's too hard to pack up and carry wet gear,\" said Merchant about the first leg of the trip.\n\nAs the dog draws attention at the Visitor Centre, Merchant explains again that this is not about him.\n\n\"Everybody is the same, we are all equal and we need to change society,\" said Merchant. \"The First Nations people were hit down, knocked to the ground and we have to help them up, not because they're native, but because we are the ones that knocked them down. And the whole world has to do that not just me or you but everyone.\"\n\nMerchant grew up in Cranbrook where his parents owned a downtown shoe store. When Merchant went to work on a Saturday with his dad, Robert, his job was to wake the men who were sleeping in the alley out back. When the men woke up, his dad would put them to work, shoveling snow, sweeping the sidewalk or taking out the garbage, but no money changed hands. Merchant was sent to the burger joint across the street with the men who would get a coffee and breakfast or a burger for lunch depending on the time of day. Merchant learned early that a hand up was much better than a hand out.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nMerchant has always had a close connection to First Nations people and understands their plight.\n\n\"You ask yourself what's wrong and you realize it's the whole picture,\" said Merchant. \"It's not just one thing. Countries come over - even today, right now - and kick you off your land and then put you on a little block and say there, that's yours now, so you're broken right there. Your culture is busted.\"\n\nResidential schools were pure hell, even for some people that he knows, Merchant said.\n\n\"So you're either taken by the government away from your home or sometimes your mom and dad hear it's a good thing so they take you to the school and they take you to this school and then they take you to another school and your parents don't even know where you went. Some were beaten and raped and you don't get to talk your language and you have to learn a new one and learn to write and lose your heritage and lose everything and now you're down right here on the floor. Then you come out of there and how can you even learn to love a dog, when you were not shown love even though you went to this so-called good thing but it's crap. Some people made it out - I don't know how - they're stronger than I would ever be.\"\n\nSo everybody needs to help them, he added.\n\n\"I cannot undo the murders that have occurred along the Highway of Tears,\" said Merchant on his gofundme.com/highwayoftears page, trying to raise money for women's shelter projects.\n\n\"I hope that by raising awareness during my 1,236 km walk I can help prevent further injustices from happening.\"\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nReport a mistake\nThis has not been shared.

Red Dress Day is held in honour of and to bring awareness to the ongoing MMIWG2S crisis in Canada. Indigenous women, according to the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, are at a disproportionately high risk of homicide, representing about 10 per cent of all homicides against women in Canada, while only making up about three per cent of the country\u2019s female population. Red dresses were donated and hung at Angel\u2019s Corner near the Gordon Taylor Bridge as a visual representation of the missing, and a smudge and ceremony were held with Elder John Sinclair saying a prayer and singing a song of healing. About 20 attended the ceremony, including Town of Drumheller administration, members of BCAVA, and the Drumheller RCMP. Among those who attended the ceremony were (l-r) Elder Sinclair, Indigenous liaison Lynn Fabrick, and Drumheller Chief Administrative Officer Darryl Drohomerski.\n\n Prev\nNext \n\nThe Drumheller Mail encourages commenting on our stories but due to our harassment policy we must remove any comments that are offensive, or don\u2019t meet the guidelines of our commenting policy.\n\nAdvertise here\nAdvertise here\n\nBusiness Directory\nHome\nContact Us\nSearch\nLogin\nTop\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 DrumhellerMail.

She also said if people want, they can write what love means to them instead.\n\nFraleigh moved back to Williams Lake with family in February from Fort St. John where she was part of similar vigils there for 12 years, she said.\n\nAs she bent down to write on a rock, Linda Hunlin said she was there to honour her sister who is a survivor of a violent relationship.\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n\nAbout the Author: Monica Lamb-Yorski\n\nA B.C. gal, I was born in Alert Bay, raised in Nelson, graduated from the University of Winnipeg, and wrote my first-ever article for the Prince Rupert Daily News.\nRead more\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tInternist enjoys working in Williams Lake area\n\t\tPHOTOS: 96th Annual Williams Lake Stampede wraps on Canada Day\n\t\tCanada Day celebrated in Boitanio Park in Williams Lake\n\t\tPHOTOS: Day 3 96th annual Williams Lake Stampede done, dusted\n\t\tMen provide some helping hands at Williams Lake community garden\nFacebook Comments (0) \nYOUR VOTE MATTERS\nLooks like you have voted in all of our community polls.

It was then that she had an idea, so she went to the principal of Prince Albert\u2019s Carlton Comprehensive High School, who offered her space for the project.\n\nThe goal was to make 1,200 clay hearts, to coincide with an RCMP report which indicated there were 1,186 cases of Indigenous women who had gone missing or had been killed.\n\n\u201cWe all know in this room, a quick search does not do that number justice,\u201d Ring said.\n\nMay 5 is National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and Two-Spirit People, also known as Red Dress Day, which commemorates and raises awareness of the disproportionate number of Indigenous people who are impacted by gender-based violence.\n\nDozens gathered in the Qu\u2019Appelle Gallery of the Legislative Building, surrounded by portraits of governor generals of Saskatchewan\u2019s past, for the opening of the Heart Spirits Project.\n\nIt\u2019s an exhibit by Ring, a Prince Albert-based artist, which displays 200 of the handmade clay hearts that symbolize and honour an Indigenous person who is missing or was murdered.\n\nAfternoon Headlines\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe hearts were constructed over multiple one-hour workshops by many people, including students and community groups. The work shops were an opportunity for people to come together and contemplate their thoughts and feelings on the matter, Ring said.\n\n\u201cIt was a true community effort. The feedback I received was overwhelming,\u201d Ring recalled. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t think there was a day that I didn\u2019t cry or experience tears in the sessions.\u201d\n\nDignitaries and guests sit in the front row during the opening of Saskatchewan artist Cheryl Ring\u2019s project The Heart Spirits Project inside the Saskatchewan Legislative Building on Friday, May 5, 2023 in Regina.

What happened? Why are we here now and how did we get here?\u201d Carrier said.\n\n\u201cAll of these are questions society has tried to answer but what is important is to find a solution, to work together to find a solution, so we can have our mothers, daughters, sisters, aunties, cousins be sacred again and forever more.\u201d\n\nThe art exhibit will be open to the public at the Legislative Building\u2019s Cumberland Gallery throughout the month of May.\u00a0\n\ncrmartell@postmedia.com\n\nRECOMMENDED FROM EDITORIAL\nArt exhibit opens, Red Dress Day commemorated at Saskatchewan Legislature\nSaskatchewan government announces $400,000 for MMIWG+ community response fund\n\nThe news seems to be flying at us faster all the time.

Her family frantically searched for the 21-year-old mother, but struggled to get help from local law enforcement. Days later, on July 8, Harris\u2019 decomposed body was discovered in a ditch near the rodeo grounds on the reservation.\u00a0\n\nHarris\u2019 mother and sister spoke to the Billings Gazette months after Harris\u2019 death about their desperate hope for answers. How would they explain her death to her then-18-month-old son Jeremiah Harris?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be the auntie,\u201d Harris\u2019 sister, Rose Harris, told the newspaper. \u201cWhat am I going to tell him about his mom?\u201d\u00a0\n\nIt would take nearly a year for Harris\u2019 killers to be arrested and charged with her murder and sexual assault. Eugenia Ann Rowland and Garrett Sidney Henderson Wadda were later found guilty of killing Harris, though her cause of death could not be determined because of the body\u2019s decomposition, the Billings Gazette reported.\u00a0\n\nHarris\u2019 case is part of an ongoing crisis affecting Native communities across the United States and Canada. On April 29, 2021, the U.S. Senate cited Harris\u2019 case in a resolution that designated May 5 as \u201cNational Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls.\u201d The date was chosen to honor Harris, who was born on May 5, 1992.\u00a0\n\nPeople attend a Red Dress Day event outside the City Hall in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on May 5, 2021, to commemorate missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. May 5 is the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, an ongoing crisis affecting Native communities across the United States and Canada. Photo by Liang Sen/Xinhua/Getty Images.\n\nWhile the crisis has finally been acknowledged by Congress, the federal government has historically remained silent on the issue. For years, Indigenous leaders have warned that violence against Native communities has reached epidemic levels, with violence against Indigenous women particularly prevalent. In the U.S., Indigenous women are murdered at a rate 10 times higher than other ethnicities.\n\nNow, grieving loved ones like Harris\u2019 have a new champion who is prepared to address this crisis: Interior Secretary Deb Haaland. In one of her first acts, the first Native American to hold a cabinet position established a unit to investigate missing and murdered Indigenous people in the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\n\u201cViolence against Indigenous people is a crisis that has been underfunded for decades. Far too often, murders and missing persons cases in Indian country go unsolved and unaddressed, leaving families and communities devastated,\u201d Haaland said in an April 1 statement announcing the new unit.\n\nThe Missing and Murdered Unit aims to \u201cput the full weight of the federal government\u201d into investigating cases involving missing and murdered Indigenous people and marshal resources across federal and tribal agencies. According to Haaland\u2019s announcement, the unit will also work with tribal, BIA, and FBI investigators on active missing and murdered investigations \u201cto hold people accountable, keep our communities safe, and provide closure for families.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nRenewed Hope for Justice\n\nActivists say that after years of relentlessly pushing for justice, the new unit gives them renewed hope. Chase Iron Eyes is a member of the Oglala Nation and lead counsel for the Lakota People\u2019s Law Project, which works to protect Lakota people from threats such as the Dakota Access pipeline and foster care abuse of Native children. Iron Eyes says he is encouraged by the announcement and notes Haaland\u2019s unique position, as a Native woman, in understanding the crisis. Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo, has pledged to make the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous people one of her top priorities as secretary of the interior.\n\nU.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland speaks during a daily press briefing at the White House on April 23, 2021, in Washington, D.C. Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.\n\nThe National Crime Information Center has about 1,500 active missing Indigenous people cases in its database, while 2,700 others cases of murder and non-negligent homicide were reported to the federal government\u2019s Uniform Crime Reporting Program.\n\nAnnita Lucchesi is the executive director of Sovereign Bodies Institute, an Indigenous-led organization that gathers and disseminates research on gender and sexual violence against Indigenous people. She welcomed the new unit as a good idea but noted that it will need proper execution for it to make a real impact.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s easy to get our hopes up, but I\u2019m also trying to be cautious about it, with the understanding that this issue is systemic, and one unit can\u2019t really fix that systemic nature of it,\u201d says Lucchesi, who is of Cheyenne descent and lives on Wiyot territory.\u00a0\n\nLucchesi notes that past federal initiatives have \u201creally missed the mark,\u201d calling them insensitive, ineffective, and re-traumatizing for families. This includes the Trump administration task force dubbed Operation Lady Justice, which aimed to improve the way law enforcement agencies address new and unsolved cases of missing or murdered Indigenous people but \u201creally didn\u2019t do any outreach to families to provide testimony,\u201d Lucchesi says. She says the task force assumed that Native families could easily access and figure out the process to participate. When these families were able to join, the task force reportedly limited their testimonies to just three and a half minutes.\u00a0\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s just not trauma-informed and, also, it was really just unfair,\u201d Lucchesi says. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t communicate to families that [the U.S. government is] actually interested in family perspectives and experiences or in making the system more responsive to family needs.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nActivists say they hope the Missing and Murdered Unit will be both accessible and responsive to families and that there will be cooperation and collaboration among different law enforcement agencies. Lucchesi notes that many families have faced law enforcement agencies that have not only been inaccessible to them but have completely failed them.\n\nIn Harris\u2019 case, local law enforcement refused to help her family when they reported Harris missing on July 5. Instead, police told Harris\u2019 mother, Malinda Harris Limberhand, that her daughter was probably out drinking and would eventually turn up, the Billings Gazette reported. Local police and other agencies eventually joined the search on July 8. Harris\u2019 body was discovered that night.\u00a0\n\nDuring the federal investigation that followed, investigators kept Limberhand largely in the dark, she told reporters. \u201cAll they keep telling me is that it\u2019s an ongoing investigation and that they\u2019re looking into leads,\u201d she said in an interview with the Billings Gazette two months before Harris\u2019 killers were charged.\u00a0\n\nPeople who have lost Native and Indigenous women in their lives stand as the student group First Nations, in collaboration with Indigenous Sisters Resistance and the ASUW Womxn\u2019s Action Committee, hosted the third annual Missing and Murdered Indigenous Woman\u2019s candlelight memorial vigil on Feb. 14, 2019, at the University of Washington campus, in Seattle. Photo by Genna Martin/San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images.\nAn Opportunity for Real Change\n\nDespite potential challenges the Missing and Murdered Unit faces, including the large volume of cases along with communication and cooperation between different agencies, Lucchesi and Iron Eyes say they believe the nation is in a good place to unpack and address the murder and abuse of Indigenous people. Iron Eyes cites the very founding of America by European colonizers as the reason it has taken the federal government so long to address issues affecting Native communities.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe are a great experiment as a country,\u201d Iron Eyes says. \u201cSo it\u2019s taken this long to finally have a truthful reckoning with ourselves. It\u2019s not going to take that much longer because we\u2019ve also reached a critical mass of people who recognize that justice is not blind here. Justice sees color here. Justice sees sex. And justice is highly discriminatory here, even though we don\u2019t want to say it is.\u201d\n\nLucchesi says the U.S. is fortunate to be living in a time of \u201crobust national dialogue\u201d on issues including racial violence, police bias, and the failures of the American justice system. Those issues are contributing factors to the missing and murdered Indigenous people crisis, she says, and she hopes the public is able to connect them to a broader conversation on the re-imagining of justice and safety.\u00a0\n\nLucchesi notes that the public needs to understand that these issues don\u2019t just affect Native communities. \u201cI think the most important thing to understand is that this isn\u2019t just a Native issue or just a women\u2019s issue,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is an everybody issue because it\u2019s an issue of public safety and an issue of justice.\u201d\n\nWE NEED YOUR SUPPORT.\n\nFor 30 years, YES!

Regan Jacobson, the mental health capacity building coordinator with PACI and St. John\u2019s School, said they\u2019re trying to provide awareness, promote good health, and build capacity around mental health issues.\n\n\u201cOur mental health professionals are like the firefighters and we are like Smokey the Bear,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cWe are doing prevention.\u201d\n\nThe idea was to be preventative and share the positive impact music can have.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to teach a variety of different strategies and a lot of self-regulation tools that are easy, that work for students,\u201d she explained. \u201c(The) community connection, music itself, and all of this has to do with that.\u201d\n\nThe event coincided with Red Dress Day, which is held in remembrance of MMIWG2S (Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and Two Spirit people), so there was red dresses incorporated into the grounds.\n\nMichael Oleksyn/Daily Herald Elder Pearl Morin did a prayer to open Music for the Mind at PACI on Friday afternoon.\n\nElder and Knowledge Keeper Pearl Morin gave the festival a prayer while red dresses hung in the flowers.\n\nJacobson said it\u2019s important to recognize the two events, because poor mental health can be a factor in missing persons cases.\n\n\u201cMental health that\u2019s a huge connection and so I think juts being aware and taking a moment and recognizing they exist together is a really great thing as well,\u201d she said.\n\nThe emcee for the afternoon was PACI Principal Dave Leuchinger. Jacobson and her associate, Jaime Smith-Windsor, discussed their program before the concert.\n\nMichael Oleksyn/Daily Herald (L to R) Mental Health Capacity Building workers Jaime Smith-Windsor and Regan Jacobson spoke during Music for the Mind at PACI on Friday afternoon.\n\nThe performers were LJ Tyson and Heartwarming. Both bands have connections to PACI.\n\n\u201cBoth of them are PACI alumni bands, so that was really great and Mike Mogg, the Garage Band teacher, was able to organize the bands to come out for us. Everyone was just happy to be a part of it, I think, and ready to get summer started. It\u2019s just a feel-good festival.\u201d\n\nStudents from elementary schools from around the division were in attendance.\n\n(in italics) Editor\u2019s Note: the Jaime Smith-Windsor mentioned in this story is not the Jaimie Smith-Windsor who serves as a trustee on the Sask.

Dogar argues he did nothing wrong, but will apologize \u201cto appease.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe order follows a report from the integrity commissioner that was presented to council during a private meeting on Feb. 15. The report concluded Dogar violated council\u2019s code of conduct on treating people \u201cwith courtesy, dignity and respect and without abuse, bullying or intimidation.\u201d Dogar had a right to have legal counsel at the meeting, but did not.\n\nCouncil has condemned Dogar\u2019s public behaviour at least four times since he was elected in Oct. 2021. This is the second incident involving comments made towards Indigenous people.\n\nThe report says at a June 28 meeting, Dogar left a presentation on supporting the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG). The complaint says Dogar missed key moments from presenters and during a break, he spoke to presenters and their supporters in \u201can antagonizing tone.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nCouncil voted\u00a0Dogar must apologize to the complainant and attend Indigenous Awareness training. He must report on his progress to council within three months. Only Dogar opposed the motion.\n\nThe report is not public and a public summary of the meeting does not mention what Dogar is accused of saying or doing. Dogar denied doing or saying anything inappropriate and said he left the meeting to use the washroom. He insists he \u201cjust wanted to say hello, hi and what is going on,\u201d and left because \u201cthey were not very friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told council I\u2019m not going to apologize as a mistake. But if anybody is knowingly or unknowingly takes some offence, I am honoured\u00a0to make them happy or to appease, mitigate any annoyance,\u201d he said. \u201cSince they are girls, females\u2026 I\u2019m very, very docile or lenient with the females. If they felt anything wrong, I openly and in front of the integrity commissioner I voluntarily said I can apologize. Not as a fault.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nPeople march down Franklin Avenue for Red Dress Day in Fort McMurray, Alta. on Thursday, May 5, 2022. The day marks a national day of mourning and awareness for missing, murdered and exploited Indigenous peoples (MMEIP). Vincent McDermott/Fort McMurray Today/Postmedia Network\nDogar wants province to investigate past incidents\n\nThe first time Dogar angered Indigenous leaders was in a Feb. 2022 meeting when he was was\u00a0accused of minimizing the missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and two-spirited people (MMIWG2S) crisis.\n\nDogar said in the meeting there was no\u00a0\u201ccampaign against the Indigenous people\u201d and the issue was not a municipal matter.\u00a0He later admitted his English-speaking skills are poor and\u00a0have caused \u201cmisunderstandings at times.\u201d\n\nThere have been at least nine Indigenous women from the Fort McMurray Wood Buffalo region that have been murdered or reported missing since 2004.\n\nThe integrity commissioner also found Dogar violated\u00a0multiple codes of conduct in two separate incidents with municipal employees in Oct. 2021, and regarding Facebook posts he made in Dec. 2021.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThose two reports have also not been made public, but Dogar was found to have violated the\u00a0code of conduct sections on discriminatory comments, attempting to influence administrative staff and disclosing confidential information.\n\nDogar apologized for those incidents, but said in an interview he did nothing wrong. He also wants Municipal Affairs Minister Rebecca Schulz to overturn the integrity commissioner\u2019s reports and launch new investigations into those complaints. The ministry can only do this following a request from council or a judge\u2019s order.

You should be\n\nSat 7 May 2022 14.00 BST\nShare\nSign up to receive the latest US opinion pieces every weekday\nAaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrgggggh\n\nI tried to think of a pithy introduction to this week\u2019s newsletter. Something witty, something drily poking fun at the dystopic week we\u2019ve had. Something that was not yet another reference to Gilead and the Handmaid\u2019s Tale. But, unfortunately, all jokes were drowned out with internal existential screaming: aaaarggh.\n\nAccording to one Republican, pregnancy from rape is \u2018an opportunity\u2019\nArwa Mahdawi\nRead more\n\nFirst, there was the bombshell leak on Monday night of a draft supreme court opinion that appeared to show the court is ready to overturn Roe v Wade and the federal right to an abortion. While this was a shock it wasn\u2019t exactly a surprise. When Donald Trump was elected plenty of people were worried about the future of reproductive rights in the US. Calm down, dear, we were told by Reasonable Rational People\u2122. You\u2019re being alarmist!\n\nLike clockwork, the Reasonable Rational People\u2122 emerged right after the supreme court leak to chide anyone worried that Republicans are not going to stop at overturning Roe but want to take away even more of our rights. \u201cI think the people catastrophizing about contraception or interracial marriage being next after Roe sincerely believe it,\u201d a (female) Washington Post columnist snarked on Twitter on Wednesday. \u201cBut I\u2019m sorry, I cannot take this seriously.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry, we should all be taking this very seriously indeed. On the same day that prominent columnists were telling people to calm down \u2013 and less than 48 hours after the leaked supreme court opinion \u2013 Republicans in Louisiana advanced a bill that would redefine personhood to begin at the moment of fertilization and make abortion a crime of murder. Yes, you read that right: the moment of fertilization. I\u2019m sure the people involved in drafting this law have no idea about how reproduction actually works (they like controlling female bodies, not learning about them), but between one-third and one-half of all fertilized eggs never fully implant. Which means someone in Louisiana needs to arrest God \u2013 he\u2019s responsible for a hell of a lot of abortions! This incredibly broad definition of personhood also means that anyone experiencing an ectopic pregnancy (which are not viable and very dangerous) in Louisiana has only two choices: go to prison or die. And that\u2019s not all: experts are worried that the law would criminalize in vitro fertilization as well as some forms of birth control.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason I brought God up just now. There\u2019s supposed to be a division between church and state in the US but the people who drafted the Louisiana law seemingly forgot about that. The proposal contains a line about \u201cthe sanctity of innocent human life, created in the image of God\u201d. This is clearly unconstitutional \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t bother the bill\u2019s creators who have made it very clear that they don\u2019t care about democratic norms. Indeed, the bill\u2019s text states that the state should enforce the law \u201cwithout regard to the opinions and judgments of the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d on abortion.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the Louisiana bill will become law anytime soon. But what is clear is that we are going to see more and more extreme proposals like this. As I discussed in a previous Week in Patriarchy, radicalized Christian nationalism is a growing threat in the US; a small but very organised group of people are intent on turning the country into a modern theocracy. A few years ago a researcher called Frederick Clarkson exposed a Christian supremacist initiative called Project Blitz, whose mission is undermining the separation of church and state. You know what one major component of their strategy is? Flooding state legislatures with so many bills that trying to fight them becomes a game of \u201cWhac-A-Mole\u201d. And as liberals are busy playing Whac-A-Mole with proposals like this Louisiana bill, extremists and evangelicals are busy consolidating power. So don\u2019t let anyone tell you that you\u2019re \u201ccatastrophizing\u201d.\n\nData broker sells locations of people who visit abortion clinics\n\nAccording to Motherboard, a company called SafeGraph obtains location data from ordinary apps on people\u2019s phones and sells it on. Planned Parenthood is classified by SafeGraph as a \u201cbrand\u201d that can be tracked; Motherboard was able to get a week\u2019s worth of data on where people who visited Planned Parenthood came from, and where they went afterwards for just $160.\n\nFox host says he doesn\u2019t know why people would hire pregnant women for important jobs\n\nBrian Kilmeade was referencing Nina Jankowicz, who was recently appointed to lead a newly created advisory board on misinformation at the Department of Homeland Security. She is eight months pregnant. Kilmeade, by the way, is a father of three. For some reason he doesn\u2019t seem to think that becoming a father had any impact on his ability to do his job. (Then again, a racist potato could do his job, so that\u2019s not saying much.)\n\nMissing and murdered Indigenous women remembered\n\nThursday marked Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Day in the US and Red Dress Day in Canada. As CNN reports: \u201cNationally, there were 764 unresolved cases of missing Native American people as of March 2022, according to data from the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System. But advocates and experts have said those figures do not reflect the full extent of the issue due to the lack of comprehensive data.\u201d\n\nMenopausal women lack basic support, UK study finds\n\nAbout 80% of women surveyed said their workplaces have no policies or help in place; 41% said menopause symptoms were treated as a joke by colleagues; 45% said they avoid speaking to their doctor due to stigma.\n\nThe week in pac-triarchy\n\nThe World Video Game Hall of Fame announced its latest inductees on Thursday; among the four \u201ciconic\u201d games are Ms Pac-Man. The 41-year-old arcade game is munching its way into the Hall of Fame seven years after Pac-Man.\n\nExplore more on these topics\nAbortion\nOpinion\ncomment\nShare\nReuse this content\nMost viewed\nHurricane Beryl barrels through Cayman Islands after battering Jamaica\nUK general election results 2024: live tracker\nCoffee, eggs and white rice linked to higher levels of PFAS in human body\nTrump calls Biden \u2018broken-down\u2019 and claims he quit 2024 race in leaked video\nMillions go to the polls in general election \u2013 as it happened\nMost viewed\nThe Guardian view\nColumnists\nCartoons\nOpinion videos\nLetters\nNews\nOpinion\nSport\nCulture\nLifestyle\nOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morning\nSign up for our email\nHelp\nComplaints & corrections\nSecureDrop\nWork for us\n\u00a0\nPrivacy policy\nCookie policy\nTerms & conditions\nContact us\nAll topics\nAll writers\nDigital newspaper archive\nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nX\nNewsletters\nAdvertise with us\nSearch UK jobs\nBack to top\n\u00a9 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Photograph: Ruth Fremson/New York Times\n\nDozens of Canadian women and girls, most of them indigenous, have disappeared or been murdered near Highway 16, a remote ribbon of asphalt that bisects British Columbia and snakes past thick forests, logging towns and impoverished Indian reserves on its way to the Pacific Ocean. So many women and girls have vanished or turned up dead along one stretch of the road that residents call it the Highway of Tears.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n\n\nA special unit formed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police officially linked 18 such cases from 1969 to 2006 to this part of the highway and two connecting arteries. More women have vanished since then, and community activists and relatives of the missing say they believe the total is closer to 50. Almost all the cases remain unsolved.\n\nThe Highway of Tears and the disappearances of the indigenous women have become a political scandal in British Columbia. But those cases are just a small fraction of the number who have been murdered or disappeared nationwide. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have officially counted about 1,200 cases over the past three decades, but research by the Native Women's Association of Canada suggests the total number could be as high as 4,000.\n\nIn December, after years of refusal by his conservative predecessor, prime minister Justin Trudeau announced a long-awaited national inquiry into the disappearances and murders of indigenous women. The inquiry, set to cost 40 million Canadian dollars (\u20ac27 million), is part of Trudeau's promise of a \"total renewal\" of Canada's relationship with its indigenous citizens, and it comes at a critical time.\n\nPolice racism\n\nAboriginal women and girls make up about 4 per cent of the total female population of Canada but 16 per cent of all female homicides, according to government statistics.\n\nCarolyn Bennett, the minister of indigenous and northern affairs, has spent months travelling across the country to consult with indigenous communities. During her meetings, families and survivors have complained of racism and sexism by the police, who she said treated the deaths of indigenous women \"as inevitable, as if their lives mattered less\".\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s clear is the uneven application of justice,\u201d Bennett said. One reason to doubt the estimate by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, she said, is that the police often immediately deemed the women\u2019s deaths to be suicides, drug overdoses or accidents, over the protests of relatives who suspected foul play. \u201cThere was no investigation,\u201d she said, citing one recent case. \u201cThe file folder\u2019s empty.\u201d\n\nA United Nations report last year described measures by the previous government to protect aboriginal women from harm as \"inadequate\" and said that the lack of an inquiry into the murders and disappearances constituted \"grave violations\" of the women's human rights. Failures by law enforcement, it added, had \"resulted in impunity\".\n\nRadek, a co-founder of Tears4Justice, an advocacy organisation, said, \u201cWhen it comes to the missing, racism runs deep.\u201d The federal government has allocated 8.4 billion Canadian dollars (\u20ac5.7 billion) over five years to aid indigenous communities, which have disproportionately high levels of poverty, incarceration, alcoholism and substance abuse, and often lack basic necessities like safe drinking water.\n\nBennett said the breakdown in aboriginal communities was the product of generations of socioeconomic marginalisation and trauma tied to government policies. Particularly damaging was a state-financed, church-run boarding school system for aboriginal children who were forcibly taken from their families by officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Many of the 150,000 children who were sent to residential schools over a century became victims of physical and sexual abuse. The programme was fully shut down in the mid-1990s.\n\nCovering 450 miles between the city of Prince George and the Pacific port of Prince Rupert, the Highway of Tears is both a microcosm of Canada's painful indigenous legacy and a serious test for Trudeau as he tries to repair the country's relationship with aboriginal people.\n\nOn a recent journey along Highway 16, scenes of stunning wilderness were flecked by indigenous communities reeling from economic decay and the anguished memories of missing and murdered women. A few miles outside Prince George, the highway plunges into thick forests veined with logging roads and the occasional \u201cmoose crossing\u201d sign. \u201cGirls Don\u2019t Hitchhike on the Highway of Tears,\u201d reads a large yellow billboard alongside the road farther north. \u201cKiller on the Loose!\u201d\n\nDesperate people\n\nAs a bald eagle soared overhead, Brenda Wilson (49), the Highway of Tears co-ordinator for Carrier Sekani Family Services and the sister of one of the victims, gestured to the wall of evergreens that flank the road. \"The trees are really dense here, so if you're looking for someone, it's pretty hard to find them,\" she said, listing the names of several women who are still missing.\n\nThe perils do not stop desperate people from thumbing rides. Just outside the village of Burns Lake, Drucella Joseph (25), an unemployed aboriginal woman, eagerly climbed into the back of a passing car along with her boyfriend, Corey Coombes. \u201cFriends will drive me when I really need a ride, but other than that, we just hitchhike,\u201d she told the driver. The couple gets by on his disability payments and on donated food from food banks. Neither has a mobile phone. When hitchhiking, Coombes says he protects himself by carrying a club or a screwdriver.\n\nBritish Columbia is infamous for serial killers and criminals who often targeted aboriginal women. In 2007, Robert William Pickton, a pig farmer, was convicted of killing six women, though the DNA or remains of 33 women were discovered on his land. Many of them were aboriginal.\n\nOne of Canada's youngest serial killers, Cody Legebokoff, was 24 when he was convicted in 2014 of killing four women near the Highway of Tears. David Ramsay, a former Prince George provincial court judge and convicted paedophile, was imprisoned in 2004 for sexually and physically assaulting indigenous girls as young as 12.\n\nAnguished family members said they received little help from the authorities, a sharp contrast to the cases of missing white women. After Chipman vanished in 2005, her aunt, Radek, said the police objected to the family putting up its own \u201cmissing\u201d posters. \u201cThey knew we were searching day and night, and they did nothing to help us,\u201d she said. The next day, she said, a white woman disappeared near Vancouver \u201cand the police were out in the streets putting up posters\u201d.\n\nAfter her daughter Ramona disappeared in 1994, the police refused to act, said Matilda Wilson, a member of the Gitxsan First Nation. \u201cThey gave us all these different excuses that she might be back tomorrow or next week,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThere was no hurry or alarm about it, so we started looking ourselves.\u201d\n\nMemorial walk\n\nDespite multiple searches, Wilson, a single mother of six who is now 65, said there was no sign of Ramona until she had been gone for seven months, when Wilson received an anonymous phone call telling her that the girl\u2019s body was near the airport.\n\nPolice officers searched the area but found nothing, she said. In April 1995, two men riding all-terrain vehicles by the airport discovered Ramona\u2019s remains buried under some trees. Plastic flowers and a glass cross now decorate her grave in a Smithers cemetery, a few blocks from Wilson\u2019s tidy trailer-park home.\n\nAngry with the police for failing to find the teenager or to alert people to the history of missing women near Highway 16, Wilson and her family organised a memorial walk in June 1995 that has become an annual event, garnering attention from the media and inspiring activism from families of other missing women.\n\n\u201cWe want closure, and we\u2019re not going to give up,\u201d Wilson said as she swept leaves from her daughter\u2019s gravestone.\n\nOne recent afternoon, three young aboriginal sisters and their female cousin were walking across the Moricetown Indian Reserve, which abuts the highway. Asked about the Highway of Tears, one of the women, Rochelle Joseph, an unemployed 21-year-old, said the sisters never hitchhiked because they grew up hearing about the victims, including their cousin, Chipman.\n\nStill, the menace of the highway haunts their lives. \u201cThe stories made us cautious,\u201d Joseph said quietly, voicing their fear of a serial killer lurking behind the steering wheel of any strange car. \u201cHe\u2019s probably still out there.\u201d\n\nNew York Times\n\nCanadian Mounted Police\nNative Women S Association Of Canada\nUnited Nations\nBrenda Wilson\nCarolyn Bennett\nCody Legebokoff\nDavid Ramsay\nDelphine Nikal\nGladys Radek\nJustin Trudeau\nRamona Wilson\nRobert William Pickton\nTamara Chipman\nIN THIS SECTION\nBritain awaits 10pm election exit poll as Labour tries to win back power\nHizbullah fires 200 rockets at Israel to avenge killing of commander\nCelebrated journalist Robert Fisk\u2019s last book launched in Dublin\n\u2018We\u2019ve been lucky so far\u2019: Scientists continue working in Ukraine\u2019s bomb-scarred second city\nSome 30,000 police to be deployed across France on Sunday following runoff of election\nMOST READ\nSouth Dublin school\u2019s plans to create \u2018private Aviva\u2019 in Rathgar square face local backlash\nUL chief officer launches defamation case against head of commercial operations and wife\nCo Westmeath crashes: US tourist killed and wife seriously injured while driving to airport\n\u2018Historic\u2019 pension Bill passes with only Minister for Social Protection and Ceann Comhairle in D\u00e1il chamber\nAnother crime added to long list by GAAGo\nLATEST STORIES\n\u2018Tears won\u2019t bring you back because I\u2019ve cried.

Shirley Woods of PAGC Health and Social Development said the event is a way to make sure residents are aware of the high number of missing and murdered individuals.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important for education and awareness because it is an issue in our society and it went a long time without anybody acknowledging it,\u201d Woods said. \u201cAs we move forward, you always need to start with awareness before you can bring about change, and really, that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for is a change.\u201d\n\nWoods co-organized Sunday\u2019s event with Penny Constant. Constant said the PAGC has always tried to pay tribute even before Red Dress Day became so wide-spread. She said it was important to show the lives of those who went missing or were murdered still\nmatter today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be ongoing and I think the more awareness that we bring\u2014not only on this day\u2014but throughout, and create awareness for not only Indigenous women, but young women who are not accustomed to this society\u2019s expectations,\u201d Constant added.\n\nMay 5 marks the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two-Spirit People (MMIWG2S). Every year on that day, red dresses are hung on display to honour the victims, survivors, and those impacted by the ongoing crisis of gender\u0002based and racialized violence faced by Canada\u2019s Indigenous population.\n\nElder Shirley Sanderson opened and closed the ceremony with a prayer in her own language.\n\n\u201cI hope that these gatherings will get bigger,\u201d Sanderson said. \u201cOur young people need to know and to show them what we are doing here, to show them what love and care and forgiveness is.\u201d\n\nGeorge Mirasty, who served as emcee led a moment of silence. Mirasty also acknowledged the family of Drew Ballantyne who were holding missing person signs throughout the event.\n\nOne of the closing speakers was the mother of 34-year-old Ballantyne, Loretta, who spoke on day 665 since Ballantyne went missing. She was joined at the podium by Drew\u2019s son and her grandson, Daniel, where she shared the struggles and pain of her son being missing and highlighted some questions about the ongoing crisis, adding it\u2019s not just Indigenous women.\n\n\u201cWe have to ask ourselves, why does this keep happening? What changes need to happen?\u201d she said. \u201cWe see a lot of homeless people out there, we see a lot of addicts out there, we see a lot of gang members out there \u2013 there needs to be a way to get them out of that.\n\u201cThere needs to be a stop \u2013 we need to put a stop to it,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cYou need to look at the justice system, what\u2019s happening in the jails\u2026 a lot of the men who go to jail have no choice but to join a gang to survive. Think about those things, think about the hard reality \u2013 I am a parent, a mother of a son who went missing because of a gang.\u201d\n\nAnother speaker who has been directly impacted was Wendy Mirasty, the cousin of Danielle Dobersheck who was murdered in Melfort in March. Her long-term partner was charged with second-degree murder following an investigation. Mirasty opened by reading from Dobersheck\u2019s obituary. Mirasty became visibly emotional as she described the pain she and the family have been dealing with since Danielle was taken from them.\n\u201cWhen she died she suffered and when they had the viewing she was unrecognizable,\u201d Mirasty said. \u201cOur family is still very much grieving, and I don\u2019t think that the grief will ever go away with how she left us.\n\n\u201cWe ask that you say a prayer and continue those ongoing prayers because we are all still grieving.\u201d\n\nMirasty said she invited Doborsheck\u2019s sister to come, but it was too difficult for her. Prince Albert Deputy Police Chief Farica Prince spoke on behalf of the Prince Albert Police Service.\n\n\u201cWe know that Indigenous women are 12 times more likely to go missing or be murdered than anyone else in this country,\u201d she said. \u201cThe most difficult and most dangerous life to live in this country right now is an Indigenous woman, and that\u2019s not okay. It\u2019s time for us to hold\neach other accountable and stop hurting each other.\n\n\u201cYesterday we just announced our first homicide of 2024 and it broke my heart just like I am sure it broke all of yours. I just want to share a message that it\u2019s time for us to start taking care of one another and stop hurting each other,\u201d Prince said.\n\nPAGC Women\u2019s Commission acting chair Anita Parenteau spoke and noted that former chair of the Women\u2019s Commission Shirley Henderson was missed.\n\n\u201cShe did a lot of hard work for the families in surrounding communities and all of the bands from PAGC and all walks of life,\u201d Parenteau said. \u201cI just want to acknowledge her and she did so much work. I hope I can do some of that work and continue with that work she was doing.\n\n\u201cMy message to you is to keep loving one another and keep communicating.\u201d\n\nDrumming group Iron Swing performed the opening Honour Song and closing round dance song. PAGC executive director Al Ducharme brought a message on behalf of PAGC and the 12 chiefs. MLA Alana Ross also spoke but noted she was speaking as a person, not as a legislature member.\n\nStaff Sergeant Brian Kelly of the RCMP Indigenous Policing Services spoke and said that there are places where the force needs to improve to address this problem.\n\nIn 2014, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) released a report stating that a total of 1,181 Indigenous women and girls were killed or went missing in Canada between 1980 and 2012, based on incidents reported to all police jurisdictions across Canada.\n\nDr. Lalita Malholtra also spoke as a supporter of the event and said a prayer in her language before speaking from the heart. Constant, Woods and Edith Kadachuk of Health and Social Development also spoke.\n\nThe ceremony ended with everyone in attendance participating in a round dance.\n\nRed Dress Day was first commemorated in 2010, to pay respect to the victims, and call on all levels of government to take action to address the racialized and gendered violence inflicted on Indigenous peoples\n\n-Advertisement-\nTAGS\nMMIWG2S\nPAGC\nPrince Albert\nRed dress day\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nCopy URL\nPrevious article\nPrince Albert Police identify suspect and victim in murder case\nNext article\nPredators remain undefeated with weekend sweep in Regina\nMichael Oleksyn, Local Journalism Initiative Reporter\nMichael Oleksyn covers regional civic affairs including RMs, city council and local school divisions.

There people showed their support for those with missing or murdered family and friends.\n\n\"I remember at nine years old, my sister became a poster child for being murdered and missing,\" said Elroy Fontaine, the brother of Tina Fontaine.\n\nTina's body was found in the Red River in 2014, wrapped in a duvet that was weighed down with rocks. She was 15 years old when she was killed.\n\nElroy says he often goes to MMIWG2S marches in honour of his sister.\n\n\"To try and change something, to try and change this ongoing genocide,\" he said.\n\nThe rally encouraged people to write to their local politicians, calling for action.\n\n\"We do these marches to try and open people's eyes. We have opened people's eyes, but not the right ones,\" Elroy said.\n\nHUNDREDS MARCH IN SAGKEENG FIRST NATION WHERE MORE THAN 20 CASES REMAIN UNSOLVED\n\nIn Sagkeeng First Nation, hundreds took part in a march to mark the day.\n\nIt comes after the chief of Sagkeeng voiced his disappointment earlier this week for a lack of government resources to address the 231 calls for justice outlined in the national inquiry report.\n\nSagkeeng has the most unsolved cases of missing or murdered Indigenous women and girls in Manitoba - resulting in Friday's walk taking on a personal meaning for many.\n\n\"If we suffer just one day walking for them, imagine what they go through on a daily basis. Not knowing where they are, not understanding what is happening, not realizing that there are so many other missing and murdered women too,\" said Mary Swampy, a resident of the First Nation. \"If I can do this, I'm very grateful for it.\"\n\nCurrently there are more than 20 cases of unsolved missing Indigenous women and girls from Sagkeeng First Nation.\n\nDISPLAY TO BE SET UP OVER THE WEEKEND AT HUMAN RIGHTS MUSEUM\n\nThe Canadian Museum for Human Rights is opening a display in recognition of the day. The display includes items from selected community members who have been impacted by MMIWG2S+.\n\nThe display will be set up throughout the weekend and free for people to see.\n\nIn a joint statement from Premier Heather Stefanson, Indigenous and Reconciliation and Northern Relations Minister Eileen Clarke and Families Minister Rochelle Squires, they encouraged Manitobans to join in honouring the memories of MMIWG.\n\n\"Today, we remember those who have lost their lives to gender-based violence, and we honour the healing journeys of families and communities that live with the ongoing grief of losing a loved one,\" the statement read.\n\nThe Legislative Building will be lit with an image of the red dress, which the province says is a sign to continue dialogue and bring attention to the issue.\n\n-With files from CTV's Jill Macyshon and Devon McKendrick\n\nRELATED IMAGES\n1 / 2\nCrowds march through Downtown Winnipeg on Red Dress Day on May 5, 2023, honouring murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls and two-spirited people.

DARREN STONE, TIMES COLONIST\nListen to this article\n00:04:06\n\nOn Friday, Doreen Scow had a five-minute speech ready for the Red Dress Day ceremony in Langford that was attended by hundreds of students from the Sooke School District.\n\nBut she quickly strayed off her prepared remarks.\n\n\u201cI felt like I had to mention my late cousin Carsyn [Seaweed] too, because since her passing, Red Dress [Day] has been a lot more significant to me,\u201d Scow said.\n\nCarsyn Seaweed, 15, was found in a semi-conscious state last May, covered in twigs, leaves and a wooden pallet behind a Super 8 motel in Duncan. She later died in hospital.\n\nAfter her speech, Scow briefly chatted with a number of students, including a few who knew Seaweed personally.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still trying to process everything that happened yesterday,\u201d she said in an interview Saturday. \u201cHearing what they had to say just really, really shook me to the core.\u201d\n\nScow, who is Kwakwaka\u2019wakw and a member of the Tlowitsis First Nation, said the ongoing issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls is important to teach to the next generation.\n\nStudents from Ruth King Elementary, Savory Elementary, Spencer Middle School, and David Cameron Elementary attended Friday\u2019s Red Dress Day event at Veterans Memorial Park.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned over the years that there\u2019s ways to not sugarcoat it, but also not traumatize the students,\u201d said Scow, who does cultural teachings for the school district.\n\nIn memory of Seaweed \u2014 who was in Duncan the day before her death for a soccer tournament \u2014 the family has put together a soccer team named Forever 15 that will play in her memory at the June Sports soccer tournament in Alert Bay this summer, she said.\n\nMultiple events on the South Island will mark Red Dress Day today, the national day of awareness for missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nEvents include a prayer circle in Duncan at Station Street Park, and in Greater Victoria, a 10 a.m. walk starting at the intersection of Hallowell Road and Admirals Road in part co-organized by the Songhees and Esquimalt Nations, and a march and rally at 1:30 p.m. at the \u023d\u00c1U,WEL\u1e48EW\u0331 Tribal School in Brentwood Bay.\n\nTwo Indigenous women are organizing an overnight vigil at the B.C. legislature, that will begin today at 5 p.m. and end on Monday at 7 p.m.\n\nThe event, which is open to the public, will be streamed on social media.\n\nCo-organizer Priscilla Omulo, who is a member of the Tsartlip First Nation, said the process of reporting a missing person, putting up posters, and searching for a missing family member is hard to convey to people who haven\u2019t experienced it. \u201cUntil it happens to you, you don\u2019t really understand the challenge.\u201d\n\nRecently, one of her family members went missing but was, fortunately, located alive a month later, she said.\n\nIndigenous people searching for their missing loved ones have to contend with the additional challenge of anti-Indigenous racism that\u2019s still entrenched in society today, she said, adding that systemic injustices facing Indigenous people did not go away when residential schools were abolished.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a family member who has been shot and killed by RCMP. We have a family member who was murdered, whose assailants have not been brought to justice,\u201d she said.\n\nOmulo\u2019s voice becomes tinged with emotion when she speaks about why the colour red is used in events.\n\n\u201cRed is supposed to be the colour that people on the other side \u2014 the spirits \u2014 can see. It\u2019s calling them back home.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about being able to say that we see that your spirit is there. We see that you haven\u2019t received the justice you deserve yet \u2014 and that we are doing the best we can to remember you in a good way.\u201d\n\nElected officials at the legislature are welcome to drop by the 28-hour vigil, Omulo said. \u201cThese are real mothers, real cousins, real family members that are missing and murdered.\u201d\n\nmjlo@timescolonist.com\n\nSee a typo/mistake?\nHave a story/tip?\nThis has been shared 2 times\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nMore Local News\n\tNanaimo RCMP find illicit drugs, weapons after stopping suspected prohibited driver\n\tPolice seize 20 guns, 20,000 rounds of ammo in raid on Bear Mountain home\n\tMLA Rob Fleming says he won't run in fall provincial election\nTimes Colonist - Featured\nInjuries reported in Highway 4 crashes on Canada Day weekend\nRead More\nTRENDING TODAY\n6303\t\nFirst heat wave of the summer on the way to Vancouver Island and B.C.\n\n2625\t\nFairway grocery store closing at Westshore Town Centre\n\n2555\t\nSuspect's pants catch fire in arson attempt gone wrong: B.C.

Prior to that, she says she worked closely with the Indigenous community.\n\n\u201cI worked at a shelter for Indigenous women and children in Toronto for 15 years, so I am very aware of the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women,\u201d she said.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt has always been something that has been very close to my heart.\u201d\n\nTWEET THIS\nCLICK TO SHARE QUOTE ON TWITTER: \"IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART.\"\nThe daily email you need for Edmonton's top news stories.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, while Indigenous women make up four per cent of all women in Canada, they represent 24 per cent of female murder victims.\n\n1:50\nIndigenous women still waiting for government action after MMIWG report\nIndigenous women still waiting for government action after MMIWG report\nMother of murdered Indigenous woman says government needs to act on MMIWG inquiry recommendations\nMMIWG inquiry a \u2018failure\u2019: Family of murdered Indigenous woman\nNational billboard campaign honours MMIWG\nMoving forward after the MMIWG report\nMMIWG report calls for official Indigenous languages in Canada\nNext Video\n\nWith the Red Dress campaign, the college is hoping to raise awareness of the issue.\n\nThe campaign aims to spark conversation and immerse participants in workshops like a traditional beading class, which took place Wednesday.\n\nAs an Indigenous student at the college, Laurel Blue is constantly striving to learn more about her culture.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been kind of cut off from the culture, [I] didn\u2019t really experience it all the time growing up,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cComing to learn more about the issues and what\u2019s going on in the community is really helpful.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just helpful for the Indigenous community, but for those with a different perspective like Daniel Kissoon, a security and investigation student who is hoping to be a police officer in the near future.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very important to build rapport with different cultures.

PHOTO BY MICHELLE BERG /Saskatoon StarPhoenix\nArticle content\n\nWhat started in one city as a way to bring attention to the the high rates of murder and violence against Indigenous females and two-spirited people has become an annual event across Canada. Here are a few things to know about Red Dress Day and what to plan for around Saskatoon \u2026\n\nWHAT IS RED DRESS DAY?\n\nRed Dress Day takes place annually on May 5, the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nTRENDING\nCity of Saskatoon announces new high-level executive\n'He was my best friend': Father remembers son killed in alleged impaired hit-and-run\nWoman charged after altercation on city bus in Saskatoon's Confederation Park neighbourhood\nPolice investigating two stabbings in Saskatoon in two days\nMandryk: Sask. Party has turned truth telling into an election issue\nArticle content\n\nRed Dress Day dates back to 2010 and was inspired by a public art installation in Winnipeg by Metis artist Jaime Black, in which red dresses were displayed to bring attention to and represent MMIWG.\n\nIn Saskatoon, there is a permanent red dress installation in the lobby of City Hall.\n\nWHY WAS IT NECESSARY?\n\nIndigenous women, girls and two-spirit people are at a massively higher risk of abuse and violence than other groups. The National Inquiry for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls found that Indigenous women and girls are five times more likely to experience violence than any other population in Canada, and 12 times more likely to be murdered or to go missing.\n\nIndigenous women are also disproportionately represented in rates of police-reported intimate partner homicide \u2014 and nowhere in Canada are those rates higher than in Saskatchewan.\n\nWHAT EVENTS ARE TAKING PLACE IN SASKATOON?\n\nSeveral events are scheduled in the city between Friday and Sunday.\n\n* A calling home ceremony is set for Friday at 9 a.m. at city police headquarters. The event will include a pipe ceremony and gathering.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n* The Office of the Treaty Commissioner hosts an MMIWG education session Friday from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. on Zoom.\n\n* Also on Friday, a red dress installation takes place from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the campus bowl at the University of Saskatchewan. The day will include hands-on activities and making red dress pins. Parts of the display will be moved to Gordon Oakes Red Bear Student Centre for the weekend.\n\n* Wanuskewin will host a beaded red dress earrings workshop from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday.\n\n* A screening of \u201cK\u00edmmapiiyipitssini: The Meaning of Empathy\u201d runs Sunday from 12:30 p.m. to 2 p.m. at Remai Modern.\n\nWHEN IS THE AWARENESS WALK?\n\nThe annual awareness walk takes place Sunday at 2 p.m., starting and ending at the Vimy Memorial along the riverbank. The event is organized and led by community members, with notable support from the University of Saskatchewan, City of Saskatoon, Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations and Metis Nation-Saskatchewan.\n\nRECOMMENDED FROM EDITORIAL\nSaskatoon students raise awareness of Red Dress Day\n'A piece of our soul goes with them': Saskatoon holds MMIWG memorial for Red Dress Day\n\nWith some online platforms blocking access to the news upon which you depend, our website is your destination for up-to-the-minute news, so make sure to bookmark\u00a0thestarphoenix.com\u00a0and sign up for our newsletters\u00a0here\u00a0so we can keep you informed.\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nHeart Surgeon Shares 3 Min Routine For Daily Bowel Movements\nGundry MD\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nThree arrested after drug trafficking investigation in Saskatoon\nSaskatoon StarPhoenix\nLawyer for trucker who caused deadly Broncos crash says families have no right to sue\nSaskatoon StarPhoenix\nSeniors Are Getting Free Hearing Tests (Here's how)\nConnect Hearing\n|\nSponsored\nAt 67, woman turns to ancestral vitamin and ends years of back pain and sciatica\nSciatic Institute\n|\nSponsored\nHigh blood sugar is not from sweets!

Descendants of these last remaining animals found a new home at Wanuskewin in December as part of a conservation herd.\n\n(Submitted/Wanuskewin)\n\nThe new generation of bison born in the last month is made up of three females and one male. Their auspicious birthdays are being hailed as a powerful sign by park leadership.\n\nThe eldest arrived on Earth Day, the third on Red Dress Day, and the youngest calf on Mother\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cAlready, based on their birthdays we know these bison have an incredible sense of timing,\u201d Wanuskewin CEO Darelene Brander said in a media release. \u201cIt is an honour for our park to welcome these magnificent creatures back to their natural territory. We lay down tobacco to give thanks for their arrival and look forward to sharing this herd with all of the world. They have become a powerful symbol of hope and resilience during these trying times of isolation.\u201d\n\n(Submitted/Wanuskewin)\n\nThe bison herd is an important part of Wanuskein\u2019s Grasslands restoration project that seeks to revive the critically endangered Native Prairie Grasslands ecosystem. The project has already reclaimed a section of land previously used for agriculture within the park boundary.\n\n\u201cBy introducing bison back to the land we will be adding that essential element needed for balance in both a cultural and scientific sense,\u201d Wanuskewin Board Chair and co-Chair of the Thundering Ahead Capital Campaign, Felix Thomas said. \u201cWe aim to grow the park to act as a natural oasis within the city limits that will offer a place for families to come and connect with the land once again.\u201d\n\nWanuskewin\u2019s trails and facilities remain closed to the public due to COVID-19, they are scheduled to re-open during phase four of the Re-Open Saskatchewan Plan.\n\n(Submitted/Wanuskewin)\n\n\u2013\n\npanews@jpbg.ca\n\nOn Twitter: @princealbertnow\n\nby Alison Sandstrom\nAround the Web\nWrinkles on the Neck?

Oct. 4, 2019. (CTV News Edmonton)\n\nSHARE:\nReddit\n\n\n\n\nEDMONTON -- A special vigil was held in Edmonton Friday evening to remember Canada\u2019s missing and murdered Indigenous women.\n\nNearly 200 people showed up to the ceremony at Boyle Street Community Centre.\n\nAn RCMP report found 1,200 Aboriginal women were killed or went missing in Canada between 1980 and 2012.\n\nFriday\u2019s vigil was a way to pay respect to the affected families and raise awareness.\n\n\u201cWe see the effects in the children, we see the effects in the systems that are supposed to be set up to support them and they aren\u2019t working, so that\u2019s one of the reasons why we want everyone to hear us and try to do what they can to make changes,\u201d said Rachelle Venne with the Institute for the Advancement of Aboriginal Women.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of injustice done to those women, and there\u2019s still families that grieve for them in many, many ways,\u201d said Francis Whiskeyjack.\n\nWhiskeyjack works as a counsellor and mentor to youth, and says that these vigils are a chance for the community to get together and support the families of the murdered and missing women.\n\n\u201cA lot of the abuse whether it was sexual, physical, mental, emotional, have been left unanswered. So the memory itself\u2014that is very sacred and this is why you\u2019ll see so many people to honour them and support the families that are still grieving.\u201d\n\nWhiskeyjack says that a lot of people take the attitude of \u201cthe past is the past,\u201d but he says in order to reach reconciliation people need to talk about their experiences.\n\n\u201cWhen we speak the truth, it\u2019s very meaningful because I\u2019ve experienced it, other people have experienced it. We can forgive but we can\u2019t forget,\u201d said Whiskeyjack. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious issue, and it needs to be addressed in a kind way, and also to maintain the dignity of First Nations.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery missing or murdered Indigenous woman and girl is a person to be honoured and mourned, and belongs to a family that needs answers, and a community that needs resolution,\u201d said Minister of Culture Leela Sharon Aheer in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe commit to building an Alberta where Indigenous women and girls are valued, respected and safe to live lives filled with hope and promise.\u201d\n\nThe ceremony was one of many across the country on Sisters in Spirit Day.\n\nSHARE:\nReddit\nReport Error\nEditorial standards and\u00a0policies\nWhy you can trust CTV\u00a0News\nWATCH MORE FROM CTV NEWS\nfalse\nLIVE: Tracking the path of Hurricane Beryl\nfalse\nJosh Classen recaps the week in wild weather\nfalse\nCanadian vying to become top dog\nfalse\nHigh-speed police chase ends in collision\nfalse\nParents advocate for non-smart phones\nfalse\nFunds for transitioning from coal\nEDMONTON TOP STORIES\nWildfire burns out of control near Suncor's Firebag oilsands site\nViolent sexual offender to be released in Edmonton again: police\nAutopsy confirms death of woman found in Mill Creek Ravine was homicide\nWays to spend this weekend in Edmonton\nGunshots heard near Londonderry School during youth soccer game; police investigating\nCity suspending changes to residential parking program until 2026\nMORE FROM CTV NEWS EDMONTON\nSome parents turning to 'dumb phones' for their kids\nCTV News Edmonton's top 5 stories for June 2024\nMan shot and killed by police after crash near Fraser\nSingle-use bag fees in Edmonton set to rise on Monday\n'Bulldozing our history': Alberta man working to restore town's grain elevators\nAlberta town loses half its family doctors, declares health-care crisis\nDON'T MISS\nfalse\nPet chicken from B.C. is now a Guinness World Record holder\nfalse\nOnt. woman says black widow spider was inside bag of grapes\nfalse\nThis Calgary man is trying to climb 21 mountains in 21 days\nCTVNEWS.CA TOP STORIES\nTrying to sell or buy a home this summer?

EDWARD MILNE COMMUNITY SCHOOL\nExpand\n\nA class metalworking project at a Sooke school has turned into an opportunity to raise awareness of missing and murdered Aboriginal women in Canada.\n\nPyper Phillips, a 16-year-old Metis student at Edward Milne Community School, created a red metal dress sculpture that is both a testament to her skill using a plasma cutter \u2014 a device for cutting through metal \u2014 and a contribution to dialogue on the issue.\n\nWinnipeg-based Metis artist Jaime Black initially conceived the REDress Project, an art installation where hundreds of red dresses are hung in public places to represent the more than 1,000 missing and murdered Aboriginal women in Canada. It is a permanent exhibit at the Canadian Museum of Human Rights.\n\nOn Vancouver Island, the Lil\u2019 Dress Project grew from a conversation around the kitchen table on how the local Aboriginal community could bring more awareness to the issue in the region.\n\nThe logo for the Comox-based grassroots group, designed by First Nations artist Karver Everson, served as the template for the dress made from aluminum by Phillips.\n\n\u201cI am happy to be able to support the project,\u201d said Phillips. \u201cWorking on it has certainly increased my understanding of the issue.\u201d\n\nShe used a plasma cutter to cut out the design of the metal dress sculpture, which measures 110 centimetres tall, 66 cm wide and three millimetres thick.\n\nThe sculpture is powder-coated to give it colour and a durable finish.\n\nPhillips is enrolled in TASK (Trades Awareness Skills and Knowledge), a hands-on trades program. The program, a partnership between the Sooke School District 62 and Camosun College, gives high-school or college students the opportunity to explore five different trades.\n\nThey can choose from carpentry, electrical, plumbing, sheet metal and welding.\n\nAt Edward Milne Community School, Grade 11 and 12 students who enroll in the metal TASK program learn about metal fabrication through class, shop instruction and work experience.\n\nPhillips has created two dresses, one of which will be hung in the school, where it will be used as a learning tool. The second dress will be donated to the Lil\u2019 Dress Project, as a thank-you for allowing the school to use its design.\n\nWhile Phillips downplays her role, her instructor says she deserves recognition.\n\n\u201cShe has inspired other students by her work,\u201d said Matt Harmeson, TASK program head as well as metal fabrication teacher at the school.\n\nHarmeson said the plan is to create smaller versions of the dress for sale, donating the proceeds to the Lil\u2019 Red Dress Project.\n\nSalvation Army Christmas Kettle Campaign tops $350,000\n\nVictorians responded to the Salvation Army\u2019s Christmas Kettle Campaign over the holidays, raising more than $350,000 for local programs and services for the community\u2019s most vulnerable.\n\nThe non-profit had asked for the public\u2019s support for the annual campaign, as the COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in a significant increase in people asking for help leading up to the holidays.\n\n\u201cWe let people know there was an increase in demand and they responded,\u201d said spokeswoman Patricia Mamic. \u201cThere was an incredible outpouring of support from people in this community and those funds will stay right here to help feed, clothe and shelter those in need, while helping others escape violence and addiction.\n\nAlthough there were fewer people out and about this holiday season, they were more generous, as this year\u2019s donation total represents a $100,000 increase from last year.\n\nProvincially, the campaign raised $5.3 million.\n\nThe Canadian arm of the Salvation Army began its work in 1882 and is one of the largest providers of social services in the country. It has a presence in more than 55 communities in B.C. and 400 communities across Canada.\n\nFor more information, go to salvationarmy.ca.\n\nFriends of Uplands Park to tackle carpet burweed\n\nJoin the Friends of Uplands Park on a Carpet Burweed Crawl at Uplands Park, every Sunday from today until May.\n\nThe extremely invasive carpet burweed can destroy rare wildflowers.\n\nThe event is in partnership with Oak Bay\u2019s parks department.\n\nThe event is free to join. It runs from 1 to 3 p.m. every Sunday until May from the marine kiosk at Cattle Point in the park, off Dallas Road.\n\nFor more information, go to friendsofuplandspark.org.\n\nGot an idea for a project under Victoria\u2019s strategic plan?\n\nThe City of Victoria is accepting applications for the city\u2019s strategic plan grants, with $500,000 worth of funding available. Non-profit and community organizations are invited to submit applications for projects or programs that support the actions and outcomes of the City of Victoria\u2019s Strategic Plan and build community resilience.\n\n\u201cWe know that our community has been hit hard over the past year,\u201d said Mayor Lisa Helps. \u201cThese grants are one way that council can support local groups to create and enhance greater resilience in the community so we are better prepared and more resilient as a community as future challenges come our way.\u201d\n\nPreviously funded projects have included programs to help prevent youth homelessness, support Indigenous healing, educate renters about their legal rights and responsibilities, create a neighbourhood tool-share program, and advise newcomers on educational and financial-assistance opportunities.\n\nSince the program began in 2015, the city\u2019s annual strategic plan grants have funded 286 projects, investing $3.1 million in the community. The deadline for applications is Jan. 31.

Smoke rose over the water. Upon a closer look, you could spot dresses, all red in colour, hanging from the branches of the trees behind them.\n\nRelated: Red Dress Walk honours, remembers missing North Okanagan women\n\nRelated: Red dresses send a message\n\nTo remember all murdered and missing women, the Splatsin Nation and MMIW Drone Search Team hosted a Red Dress Walk \u2014 a nation-wide initiative that seeks to inform the public about Canada\u2019s high number of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. As part of the campaign, people within the community are asked to hang a red dress.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of missing women right across B.C. and we search for them all,\u201d said Jody Leon of the Splatsin First Nation. \u201cIt\u2019s important for people to continue to talk about the women within the Splatsin First Nation area \u2014 and for all women \u2014 and to go forward and not allow their names or their stories to be forgotten because out of that answers will come out to the RCMP and that will give closure to the families.\u201d\n\nThe women the ceremony seeks to remember include Potts, Simpson, Wertz, Bell and Traci Genereaux, whose remains were found on a Salmon River Road farm in Silver Creek in October 2017. They were all reported missing from the area in 2016 and 2017.\n\nSpeakers for the event, which began at 11 a.m. on the east side of the Len Bawtree Bridge, included the Neskonlith Indian Band Chief and Jody Leon of the Drone Search Team. A police escort in tow, the group made their way through the streets bearing signs that read, \u201cMissing but never forgotten\u201d, \u201cNo more violence against women\u201d, and \u201cNo more stolen sisters\u201d, among others.\n\nThe group eventually made their way to the Community Centre where lunch was served to participants following more speakers.\n\n\u201cWe want people to be involved and to continue to speak out,\u201d said Leon. \u201cWe want everyone to know that we will continue to look for missing women and we won\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\nRelated: Family remembers mother at Red Dress Walk\n\nRelated: Indigenous children still being treated unequally by provinces: advocate\n\nRelated: Search for missing women to continue\n\nTo report a typo, email:\nnewstips@vernonmorningstar.com.\n\n\nFollow me on Twitter @BrieChar\nEmail me brieanna.charlebois@vernonmorningstar.com\nLike us on\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tRobots, technology take care in Comox's innovative new dementia village\n\t\tComox Valley Ducky 500 winners announced\n\t\tCVRD, Clean BC to offer heat pump and electrical upgrade rebates\n\t\t'You shattered her life': 3 years for sexual assault of young Kelowna woman\n\t\tComox Valley RCMP investigating fatal overnight collision involving pedestrian\nFacebook Comments (0) \nComox Valley RCMP investigating fatal overnight collision involving pedestrian\nBlack Press Media\nDriver airlifted to hospital after Vancouver Island crash\nBlack Press Media\nStudent Discovers Genius Device to Wipe Out Mosquitoes Instantly\nTop Review Picks\n|\nSponsored\nPeople Born 1944-1984 Could Get This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nRead More\nReview: Captain Cooks Casino is the Real Deal\nTrust Pilot Rating and Review: I did what any savvy person would do.

It wasn\u2019t like her to disappear, and Herman was reported missing a few weeks later on Oct. 17.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cI was worried about her seven days a week and 24 hours a day,\u201d said Daniel. \u201cI could barely eat and I didn\u2019t even know what I was going through at the time.\u201d\n\nHerman, a member of the Chipewyan Prairie Dene First Nation, was found on March 20 at 1:49 p.m. People on a trail by the Rotary Club Gazebo at Thicket Drive and Silin Forest Road found her remains, which were brought to Edmonton for an autopsy. A cause of death was not determined, but doctors confirmed Herman\u2019s identity.\n\nDaniel said he is grateful to the people who found his daughter and has had no issues with Wood Buffalo RCMP. But, he still wants to know what happened to his daughter and wants to honour her memory.\n\n\u201cShe was a happy girl all the time just like me,\u201d said Daniel, who described Herman as a mother and daughter connected to her family. \u201cShe was a dependable, reliable and a good person and she would always reach out to anyone who ever needed help.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nHerman is one of eight Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit people (MMIWG2S), who have been reported missing or murdered in the Fort McMurray Wood Buffalo area since 2004.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that people can\u2019t ignore and pretend isn\u2019t happening,\u201d said Mayor Don Scott. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly something that affects a lot of families.\u201d\n\nTootsie Tuccaro and her son Paul comfort each other before taking media questions. Deputy Commissioner Curtis Zablocki, Commanding Officer of RCMP \u201cK\u201d Division, issued a public apology on behalf of the RCMP to the family of Amber Tuccaro on July 25, 2019.

Shirley Waquan was last seen in July 2007. Shelly Dene was last seen in July 2013. Betty Ann Deltess was last seen in Janvier in April 2018.\n\nAmber Tuccaro was reported missing in Aug. 2010 while visiting Nisku. Her remains were found in a Leduc field two years later. The RCMP admitted in July 2019 the investigation of her death was mishandled by investigators and apologized. The family refused to accept the apology.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nJanice Desjarlais was last seen climbing into a dumpster with her boyfriend near the downtown McDonald\u2019s to stay warm on Oct. 1, 2010. When her boyfriend left to get breakfast the next morning, a garbage truck emptied the dumpster. Desjarlais was likely smothered under other people\u2019s garbage and buried in the Fort McMurray landfill. Her body was never found.\n\nAudrey Bignose was found deceased outside an Eagle Ridge home on Christmas 2019.\n\nRosie Keating, executive director at Centre of Hope, said Herman, Desjarlais, Deltess and Bignose were all patrons of the organization. Keating said she had fond memories of Herman.\n\n\u201cEllie was a wonderful girl and she loved her children dearly,\u201d said Keating. \u201cShe was always pleasant and respectful when she came into the centre.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nKeating said the issue of MMIWG2S is not investigated enough and needs to be taken more seriously locally.\n\n\u201cA lot of these women seem to fall through the cracks of the justice system and we need to bring awareness to it because every person matters,\u201d said Keating.\n\nProtesters march down Franklin Avenue on Saturday afternoon, demanding a federal inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women. Vincent McDermott/Today staff\n\nLisa Marie Bourque, president of the Nistawoyou Friendship Centre, said Bignose\u2019s 2019 death was a tragedy felt by the organization. Bignose frequented the Friendship Centre and was well known by staff and patrons.\n\n\u201cShe was talented, she was an artist, she could write in ancient syllabic and she brought value to this Earth,\u201d said Bourque. \u201cShe was found dead, frozen and possibly murdered, and what have they done to look into it further? I don\u2019t think we ever got an update.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 6\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nBourque said discrimination against Indigenous women is a serious issue in the region. She hears frequent allegations of women harassed or mistreated by local law enforcement.\n\n\u201cIf something is happening to you, sometimes you don\u2019t even want to call for help,\u201d said Bourque. \u201cWhen they look at you, all they see is just another Native and don\u2019t think you need to be taken seriously.\u201d\n\nSara Loutitt, a local M\u00e9tis activist, said a large transient workforce with few ties to the region puts marginalized communities at risk of abuse. Indigenous leaders call this \u201cenvironmental violence.\u201d Rural communities also have limited resources for people fleeing domestic or sexual violence.\n\n\u201cThings have slowed down in the past few years and the number of transient workers coming to work in Fort McMurray has slowed down but we can\u2019t somehow think that the sexual exploitation of Indigenous women has disappeared,\u201d said Loutitt.\n\nAdvertisement 7\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nMay 5 is Red Dress Day, a national annual event honouring and raising awareness of MMIWG2S people. Jes Croucher, of Paw\u00e2miw Creative, is arranging a local event with First Nations, M\u00e9tis Locals and other local Indigenous organizations.\n\nThere will be a Facebook Live panel hosted by the Athabasca Tribal Council, a walk at 1 p.m. through Centre of Hope.

Smoke rose over the water. Upon a closer look, you could spot dresses, all red in colour, hanging from the branches of the trees behind them.\n\nRelated: Red Dress Walk honours, remembers missing North Okanagan women\n\nRelated: Red dresses send a message\n\nTo remember all murdered and missing women, the Splatsin Nation and MMIW Drone Search Team hosted a Red Dress Walk \u2014 a nation-wide initiative that seeks to inform the public about Canada\u2019s high number of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. As part of the campaign, people within the community are asked to hang a red dress.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of missing women right across B.C. and we search for them all,\u201d said Jody Leon of the Splatsin First Nation. \u201cIt\u2019s important for people to continue to talk about the women within the Splatsin First Nation area \u2014 and for all women \u2014 and to go forward and not allow their names or their stories to be forgotten because out of that answers will come out to the RCMP and that will give closure to the families.\u201d\n\nThe women the ceremony seeks to remember include Potts, Simpson, Wertz, Bell and Traci Genereaux, whose remains were found on a Salmon River Road farm in Silver Creek in October 2017. They were all reported missing from the area in 2016 and 2017.\n\nSpeakers for the event, which began at 11 a.m. on the east side of the Len Bawtree Bridge, included the Neskonlith Indian Band Chief and Jody Leon of the Drone Search Team. A police escort in tow, the group made their way through the streets bearing signs that read, \u201cMissing but never forgotten\u201d, \u201cNo more violence against women\u201d, and \u201cNo more stolen sisters\u201d, among others.\n\nThe group eventually made their way to the Community Centre where lunch was served to participants following more speakers.\n\n\u201cWe want people to be involved and to continue to speak out,\u201d said Leon. \u201cWe want everyone to know that we will continue to look for missing women and we won\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\nRelated: Family remembers mother at Red Dress Walk\n\nRelated: Indigenous children still being treated unequally by provinces: advocate\n\nRelated: Search for missing women to continue\n\nTo report a typo, email:\nnewstips@vernonmorningstar.com.\n\n\nFollow me on Twitter @BrieChar\nEmail me brieanna.charlebois@vernonmorningstar.com\nLike us on\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tVernon cowgirl ropes in B.C.

He is facing questions about his claim of being Metis. PHOTO BY STEVE LAMBERT /The Canadian Press\nArticle content\n\nManitoba\u2019s environment minister is facing scrutiny over his identification as a \u201cproud M\u00e9tis Canadian,\u201d the latest in a number of prominent Canadians who\u2019ve been accused of claiming Indigenous ancestry without sufficient evidence.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nKevin Klein has said he\u2019s a member of the Painted Feather Woodland M\u00e9tis, but his brother and the Manitoba M\u00e9tis Federation have questioned his claims.\n\n\u201cIt saddened me and it brought up a lot of emotions. It brought up a lot of history,\u201d said Klein, when reached Monday morning by National Post.\n\nKlein has been a provincial legislator since 2022, and before that he served on Winnipeg\u2019s city council. At various points in his political career, he has mentioned his Indigenous ancestry \u2014 specifically in relation to his mother, Joanne Winacott, who was murdered by her second husband in 1991.\n\nIn December 2021, Klein spoke in Winnipeg council, during a debate about the police budget. He said, \u201cI have very little to say on this one, but I want to speak from a place that no one else on council can speak from.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nHe went on to speak about police response times.\n\n\u201cMy Indigenous mother was murdered because the police didn\u2019t respond to the initial call. That is on record in, and it\u2019s in the court documents,\u201d Klein said at the time.\n\nKlein referenced his mother\u2019s identity again on May 5, 2022, in an Instagram video for Red Dress Day, also known as the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and Two-Spirit People.\n\n\u201cMy mother was murdered by her partner, and she was Indigenous,\u201d he said.\n\nI'm not self-identifying, nor am I using it, nor am I mentioning it every time I open my mouth\n\nKlein\u2019s brother, Christopher Rout, has firmly rejected the characterization that his family has Indigenous heritage.\n\n\u201cHe never grew up M\u00e9tis. My grandparents never told us we were M\u00e9tis. I never heard anything about us being M\u00e9tis,\u201d said Rout in an interview with the National Post. \u201cThe net bottom line is we are not Aboriginal at all.\u201d\n\nThe Winnipeg Sun's Daily Headline News\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nKlein, who\u2019s a Progressive Conservative MLA, told National Post that he first learned of his purported M\u00e9tis ancestry when speaking with his uncle Dave. They were going through old photo albums, and his uncle asked him if he had his M\u00e9tis card, Klein said.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m M\u00e9tis,'\u201d Klein recalled. \u201cHe pulled out his card and said \u2018We are. You need to get your M\u00e9tis card because your mom never had the chance to.\u2019 \u201d\n\nKlein then applied to the Painted Feather Woodland M\u00e9tis. His understanding was that they did their own research before issuing a card.\n\n\u201cIt excited me because it\u2019s a connection I never knew,\u201d he said. \u201cI went with it because of my uncle, who I loved dearly.\u201d\n\nThe uncle, said Rout, has since died.\n\nThe allegations against Klein \u2014 that his claims of Indigenous ancestry are disputed \u2014 were first reported by CBC News, which used census records to build Klein\u2019s family tree. It found no evidence of an Indigenous ancestor.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nKlein said what he knows of it came from his uncle, and that the Painted Feather Woodland M\u00e9tis did their own genealogical research.\n\n\u201cThere are many Indigenous and non-(Indigenous) who are looking for clarity on their story of origin, their family history,\u201d said Klein. \u201cAnd this is something I will continue to do as a personal journey for as long as I live.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, there have been a number of prominent Canadians who have had their claims to Indigenous identity questioned, including Ellen Turpel-Lafond, who claimed to be the first Cree judge. Her claims to be a \u201cTreaty Indian\u201d have been highly disputed.\n\nThe novelist Joseph Boyden, who\u2019s best known for writing about Indigenous culture, has long claimed Indigenous ancestry, but various news reports have since disputed his claims.\n\nAdvertisement 6\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nIn the case of Klein, his political biographies have, at various times, identified him as M\u00e9tis, although the term has recently been dropped from some of his social media accounts, CBC reported.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not self-identifying, nor am I using it, nor am I mentioning it every time I open my mouth. It is a family issue for me and a connection to my mother,\u201d Klein told CBC last fall.\n\nManitoba M\u00e9tis Federation President David Chartrand told CBC that Klein does not meet their criteria to identify as M\u00e9tis.\n\n\u201cWe do not recognize the Painted Feather Woodlands M\u00e9tis or any other group that claims M\u00e9tis identity outside our definition. This is no different than any of the other cases where groups or individuals are calling themselves M\u00e9tis when they really mean mixed heritage,\u201d Chartrand said in an email.\n\nAdvertisement 7\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nOn Monday, Klein told the Post he has dropped the identifier in some places because, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to insult anybody. It really was a proud moment for me to believe that my family had that M\u00e9tis status.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a personal journey. I don\u2019t want to insult anybody, but I am going to follow my personal journey. And that\u2019s how we got here today,\u201d Klein said.\n\n\u201cI got into public life to serve, not to offend. To help people, not degrade them. It was never, has never, was never an attempt to make a false claim.\u201d\n\nKlein, who was the publisher and CEO of the Winnipeg Sun newspaper between 2007 and 2013, which is now owned by Postmedia Network Inc., speculated that a \u201cLiberal-NDP-funded government employee\u201d raised questions about his identity in order to harm his reputation ahead of the provincial election. Manitobans go to the polls in October.\n\nAdvertisement 8\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cI can only assume it was to hurt us, to attempt to hurt us in the election when really all it did was cause more pain and sorrow for my family,\u201d Klein said.\n\nKlein\u2019s official biography, from when he was appointed to Premier Heather Stefanson\u2019s cabinet, said Klein \u201ccontinues to explore, working with Elders in Manitoba to research his connections to Indigenous community. This exploration has heightened his desire to work with Indigenous communities.\u201d\n\nA profile in What\u2019s up Winnipeg, a local magazine, reports that Klein took courses in Cree and M\u00e9tis history at the University of Alberta during COVID-19 to learn more about his roots, which he\u2019d learned about from his mother\u2019s older brother.\n\n\u201cBlond and blue-eyed Indigenous people were not uncommon among certain groups in middle America,\u201d the profile says. \u201cHis family says his roots are evident in his cheekbones, which Kevin says he could never produce a proper beard!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 9\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nWhen reached by National Post on Monday, Rout also objected to Klein\u2019s use of their mother\u2019s experience with domestic violence, and said Klein wasn\u2019t even living at home when the domestic violence and murder occurred.\n\n\u201cAs a son, you shouldn\u2019t be trying to profit or benefit from your mom\u2019s death,\u201d said Rout.\n\nKlein said he hasn\u2019t spoken to his brother in more than 25 years. He does, however, have a relationship with their other brother, Duane.\n\nIn an email provided to the National Post by Klein\u2019s office, Duane purportedly writes that he can confirm that Klein and their Uncle Dave had a M\u00e9tis card \u2014 although the email does not go so far as to confirm Indigenous ancestry in the family.\n\n\u201cNo one knows the full history of my immediate family. I am not going into any detail because I strongly believe family matters are just that, between family,\u201d the email says. \u201cI pray my mom can Rest In Peace again.\u201d\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nStop Buying Lottery Tickets & Start Doing This Instead!\nYukon\n|\nSponsored\nClick Here\nBombers' Collaros to miss first start of season vs Redblacks\nWinnipeg Sun\nCops hunt for suspect after child sexually assaulted\nWinnipeg Sun\nCasinos Hate You Doing This.

PHOTO BY UNIVERSAL PICTURES\nArticle content\n\nA sequel to The Fall Guy has already been written, but it\u2019s unlikely that it will ever get made after the film flopped at the box office this past weekend, opening below expectations with $28.5 million.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nIn an interview with Fast Company, star Ryan Gosling said he hopes to keep telling the story of his character Colt Seavers, a stuntman who is hired to track down the missing actor who is the star of his ex-girlfriend\u2019s (Emily Blunt) directorial debut.\n\n\u201cThe sequel sort of wrote itself,\u201d Gosling told the outlet. \u201cWe already know (the story) intimately. We\u2019re just hoping that people like this movie enough that we get to keep telling the story of these characters. We love them so much, and we love this world, and I feel confident that we can do it.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThese days everyone always hopes their movie can become a franchise.\u201d\n\nBut Gosling\u2019s ode to stunt performers underperformed at the box office opening with a paltry $28.5 million at North American theatres, effectively dashing his hopes for a sequel.\n\nThe Winnipeg Sun's Daily Headline News\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe Universal Pictures film kicked off summer moviegoing on the May weekend that Marvel has dominated with $100 million-plus launches for over a decade. (On the same weekend in 2023, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 debuted with $118 million.) But last year\u2019s strikes delayed Deadpool & Wolverine, which was originally slated to open on the first Friday in May.\n\nGoing into the weekend, early forecasts had The Fall Guy opening in the $30 million to $40 million range.\n\nThe action-comedy now faces a steep uphill battle to recoup its $130-million production budget.\n\n\u201cWe love these characters so much that we wanted to know, just for ourselves, what happens to Colt and (Blunt\u2019s character) Jody after the movie ends?\u201d Gosling said hopefully in his interview with Fast Company.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s the next phase for them? And we know exactly what it is. So hopefully the audience wants to know, too.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nStill, Jim Orr, distribution chief for Universal, remains bullish on the film despite its lackluster first weekend results.\n\n\u201cWe had a very solid opening,\u201d Orr told the Associated Press, trying to put a positive spin on the muted results. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to a very long, very robust, very successful run throughout the domestic box office for literally weeks if not months to come.\u201d\n\nBut despite featuring two of the stars of last summer\u2019s \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d phenomenon (Gosling starred in Barbie and Blunt appeared in Oppenheimer), The Fall Guy\u2019s faceplant likely means the film will be one-and-done. Next weekend, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes will open in theatres and a new Mad Max movie, Furiosa, is waiting in the wings later this month.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cUniversal spent money with The Fall Guy like they were delivering \u2018Barbenheimer 2.0.\u2019 But in reality what they got was a sequel to (the Sandra Bullock-Channing Tatum adventure comedy) The Lost City,\u201d Jeff Bock, a senior box office analyst with Exhibitor Relations, tells Postmedia. \u201cIt\u2019s a tall task to open the summer season in Hollywood and The Fall Guy fell noticeably short. Unfortunately, in real life, there is no second take. You get one shot at an opening weekend. Now Universal will have to pray (the film has) legs.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the high profile cast and its position as the kickoff film of the summer season, high expectations were placed on The Fall Guy, so its debut has been seen as a disappointment,\u201d says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. But he thinks there\u2019s still a chance the film can build some momentum over time.\n\nAdvertisement 6\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cFor most audiences this was seen as an original film and not based on massively known IP, particularly amongst younger moviegoers. So it will take some time for word of mouth and buzz to kick in,\u201d Dergarabedian says.\n\nIronically, during the press cycle for The Fall Guy, Gosling was asked why his 2016 action-comedy The Nice Guys also fell short of expectations and didn\u2019t land a follow-up.\n\n\u201cSo much of a sequel, I think, is decided by the opening weekend of a movie, and we opened up against Angry Birds,\u201d Gosling explained in an interview with ComicBook.com. \u201cSo Angry Birds just, just destroyed us. Angry Birds got a sequel.\u201d\n\nThe Nice Guys also faced competition on its opening weekend from Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising\u00a0and\u00a0Captain America: Civil War.\n\nAt the end of its box office run,\u00a0The Nice Guys, which co-starred Russell Crowe, managed to gross an estimated $62 million on a $50-million budget.\n\nmdaniell@postmedia.com\n\nRECOMMENDED FROM EDITORIAL\nEmily Blunt struggled doing action scenes in a corset for Amazon's 'The English'\nHow 'Barbenheimer' conquered the box office and brought moviegoers back to theatres\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nStop Buying Lottery Tickets & Start Doing This Instead!\nYukon\n|\nSponsored\nClick Here\nCops hunt for suspect after child sexually assaulted\nWinnipeg Sun\nManitoba RCMP shoot and kill man who was allegedly assaulting a woman\nWinnipeg Sun\nCasinos Hate You Doing This.

or been murdered on BC Highway 16, between Prince George and Prince Rupert, since the 1970s.\nImage Credit: Google Street View\nJanuary 28, 2017 - 9:00 PM\n\nSMITHERS, B.C. - A new bus service between Smithers and the First Nations village of Moricetown in northwestern B.C. will only take about 30 minutes, but the ride along the so-called Highway of Tears has been years in the making.\n\nThe service that starts Monday is along a small section of Highway 16, the route that stretches between Prince George and Prince Rupert where 18 women have disappeared or been murdered since the 1970s.\n\nJohn Rustad, B.C.'s minister of aboriginal relations and reconciliation, says part of the service plan involves working with First Nations communities to train bus drivers and operate transit services between their villages and major communities along the highway.\n\nFirst Nations, social-service agencies and women\u2019s groups have been calling for a shuttle bus service in the area for several years to provide safe transportation for people who live in communities along the 750-kilometre route.\n\nMoricetown Band Chief Duane Mitchell says the community is excited about the opportunity for safe and reliable transportation for their membership.\n\nThe federal and provincial governments announced a $5 million transportation plan last year that aims to improve travel and safety options along the highway and to the many remote First Nations communities in the area.\n\nRustad, who was in Smithers for the bus announcement on Friday, says the transit plan was a long time in coming.\n\nHe says further bus route expansion announcements are planned for the coming months.\n\n\"There's a real challenge in trying to provide the standard type of transit option that we think about when we think of Vancouver or Victoria,\" Rustad says.\n\n\"I know there are a lot of people who would have liked to have seen this happen more quickly, but working with families and communities to make sure we get this right was important.\"\n\nRustad says his Nechako Lakes riding in north central B.C. represents a 280-kilometre stretch of Highway 16 and includes the communities of Vanderhoof, Burns Lake and Houston.\n\nSmithers Mayor Taylor Bachrach says in a news release that the council is thrilled to see the new service.\n\n\"Not only will it help ensure the safety of residents travelling between our communities, it also marks the first partnership of its kind between the Moricetown Band and Smithers.\"\n\nNews from \u00a9 The Canadian Press, 2017\n\n\nMore News

One of these women was Krista Shore, who\u2019s mother Barbara was murdered on February 6, 1996. Shore attends the vigil every year, and for her it\u2019s an opportunity to heal.\n\n\u201cMy mother was murdered in a bad way, but I just wanted to bring some attention to all the violence and oppression my mother faced before life was taken from her,\u201d said Krista.\n\nEdmonton's breaking news sent to your email as it happens.\n\nThe ceremony ended with a reading of all of Saskatchewan\u2019s lost women. Jodie Woodward read a portion of the names. It was emotional for her because in 2012 she nearly became a part of the list.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\u201cI\u2026what happened to me was [I was] driven outside of Saskatoon on the outskirts and I was beaten and left there,\u201d said Woodward.\n\nShe had to take a \u2018compassionate leave\u2019 as a student at FNUNIV due to depression that followed her ordeal. Now she dedicates her time to battling systemic racism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the ones who are hurting. We\u2019re the ones who have to face racism on a daily basis because of our skin colour,\u201d said Woodward.\n\nThe vigil is also used as an opportunity to call on government leaders to take action and stem the tide against the number of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada.\n\nMORE ON CANADA\nHurricane Beryl forces Canadian airlines to cancel flights.

But that was only the beginning of the work,\" she said.\n\nTBnewswatch Latest News\n\nMcGuire-Cyrette said that's because it's still not safe to be an Indigenous woman in Thunder Bay, or anywhere else in Canada.\n\n\"We need to be looking at how to create community safety, changing the systems, to work collectively together. This is not just an Indigenous issue.\"\n\nShe added \"It's taken all of us to get to where we are today, and it's going to take an entire community to make this change.\"\n\nMcGuire-Cyrette believes a good place to start is with accountability, as many families are still waiting for answers and for justice for the individuals who have been lost.\n\nShe said the Sisters in Spirit Vigil allows family members to gather to discuss progress that has been made.\n\n\"When we began this work, probably 15 years ago, there was only a handful of us that were actually coming together on Oct. 4.\u00a0 Now you can see communities all across Canada coming together\u00a0and talking about the issue, wanting to make change....and looking at how we can make our communities safer.\"\n\nSee a typo/mistake?\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nGet your local Thunder Bay news briefing\nEmail\nSign Up\nTrending\n15067\t\tTrucker charged with careless driving on Highway 11/17\n6592\t\tAttempted murder charge laid after shooting incident\n4275\t\tThunder Bay residents preparing in case of LCBO strike\n3598\t\tCollision involving motorcycle leaves two seriously injured\n3268\t\tTwo tents catch fire in Thunder Bay\nComments 0\n\t\tShow\nThis story was important to me or our community:\nview results >\nNot Very\n\t\nSlightly\n\t\nFairly\n\t\nVery\n\t\nExtremely\nCOMMUNITY POLL\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nShould Thunder Bay reinstate fireworks for Canada Day?\n Yes\n No\n Don't know\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\n\t\nListings Today\n\t\nAuto\nview all\n\t13\nThis Week\n\t177\nTotal\n\nJobs\nview all\n\t14\nThis Week\n\t47\nTotal\n\nEvents\nview all\n\t10\nThis Week\n\t19\nTotal\n\nFor Sale\nview all\n\t2\nThis Week\n\t9\nTotal\n\nAnnouncements\nview all\n\t0\nThis Week\n\t0\nTotal\nUpdated: less than a minute ago\nNews\nLocal News\nBreaking News\nAround the North\nColumns\nCity Hall\nCommunity Submissions\nCity police\nOPP\nLocal Sports\nLetters to the Editor\nMonday Morning 'MUG'ing\nOntario Election\nTBT Newshour\nTBT News Stories\nTBT Sports\nNorthwest Newsweek\nCurling\nNewsletter Signup\nSubmit a News Tip\nMore\nSpotlight\nWeather\nMonday Morning 'MUG'ing\nLet's Eat\nPursuit\nBold\nPets & Animals\nWomen and Girls\nWisdom\nInspire\nPrime\nHelpers\nFollowing Up\nColumns\nEvents Calendar\nLive Music Listings\nYour Photos\nVideos\nObituaries\nObituaries\nIn Memoriam\nClassifieds\nPost an Ad\nAll Listings\nMy Ads\nMy Account\nToday's Ads\nYard Sales\nJob Postings\nAnnouncements\nLocal Flyers\nShop\nLocal Business Directory\nAutos\nReal Estate\nAdvertising\nFlyers\nReid\u2019s Furniture Flyers\nAshley Homestore Flyers\nLowery's Limited Flyer's\nLocal Flyers\nNational Flyers\nPower Centre Flyers\nHome Hardware Flyers\nHomes\nOpen Houses\nFor Sale - Houses\nFor Sale - Waterfront\nFor Rent - Apartments\nFor Rent - Houses\nFor Sale - Condos\nAll Listings and Businesses\nJobs\nPost a Job Ad\nAll Postings\nBusiness & Finance\nGovernment & Public Administration\nInformation Technology\nAuto\n*Tbnewswatch's Insurance Hotline\nToday's Gas Prices\nUsed Vehicle Listings\nUsed Dealership Directory\nNew Dealership Directory\nGames\nAbout\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nDownloads\nCommunity Guidelines\nPolitical Ads Registry\nSponsored Content\nSocial Media\nFacebook\nX\nContact Us\nAdvertising\nNews\nSubmit a news tip\n\nVisit our network of sites:\nNWOnewswatch\nSNnewswatch\nTBnewswatch\nGlobal Thunder Bay\nCKPR Thunder Bay\nRock 94\n91.5 CKPR\nEnergy 103-104\nCFNO\n\n\u00a9 2024 Dougall Media\n\n\u00d7\nBe the first to read breaking stories.

This is just north of Smithers. PHOTO BY STEVE BOSCH /Vancouver Sun\nArticle content\n\nThe last First Nation without cellular service along the infamous Highway of Tears in northern B.C. will finally get access to wireless coverage, the provincial government said Friday.\n\nA new cell tower will be built in the Witset First Nation, so people can now make phone calls along the highway between Smithers and New Hazelton.

It is one of three northern roadways along which 18 girls and women disappeared\u00a0between 1969 and 2006. Most of the cases remain unsolved.\n\nMany of the victims were hitchhiking, which prompted family and community members to advocate for better bus service and phone coverage along the remote highway, which stretches from Prince Rupert to Prince George and through to Edmonton.\n\nBus service has since been improved.\n\nBringing new wireless service to the area will also enhance the delivery of education and health care, and support businesses, Sims said.\n\nlculbert@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nRoofers Tested 17 Gutter Guards\u2026 Here\u2019s What They Discovered\nThe Actual Cost of Gutter Guards in 2024 May Surprise You\nLeafFilter Partner\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nBikers' sentencing delayed by Indigenous connections claim\nVancouver Sun\nBoy, 15, fatally attacked while walking dog with mom in north Edmonton, man in custody\nVancouver Sun\nStop scratching these, and try this instead\nDaily Pulse\n|\nSponsored\nStudent Discovers Genius Device to Wipe Out Mosquitoes Instantly!\nTop Review Picks\n|\nSponsored\nStop scanning your lottery ticket, do this instead\nDaily Pulse\n|\nSponsored\nSeniors Are Getting Free Hearing Tests (Here's how)\nConnect Hearing\n|\nSponsored\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\n\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

This is just north of Smithers. PHOTO BY STEVE BOSCH /Vancouver Sun\nArticle content\n\nThe last First Nation without cellular service along the infamous Highway of Tears in northern B.C. will finally get access to wireless coverage, the provincial government said Friday.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nA new cell tower will be built in the Witset First Nation, so people can now make phone calls along the highway between Smithers and New Hazelton. Construction began in September and is to be completed in the next few months.\n\n\u201cThis new cell tower will make it much easier for people to call for help during an emergency and is another essential element to further improve safety along Highway 16,\u201d said Minister of Citizens\u2019 Services Jinny Sims.\n\n\u201cAfter the Rogers cell tower is in service, every Indigenous community along the Highway of Tears will have access to modern cellular connectivity,\u201d Sims said.\n\nSafety along Highway 16, dubbed the Highway of Tears, has long been a concern. It is one of three northern roadways along which 18 girls and women disappeared\u00a0between 1969 and 2006. Most of the cases remain unsolved.\n\nMany of the victims were hitchhiking, which prompted family and community members to advocate for better bus service and phone coverage along the remote highway, which stretches from Prince Rupert to Prince George and through to Edmonton.\n\nBus service has since been improved.\n\nBringing new wireless service to the area will also enhance the delivery of education and health care, and support businesses, Sims said.\n\nlculbert@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nStop scratching these, and try this instead\nDaily Pulse\n|\nSponsored\nCanucks: Nikita Zadorov\u2019s agent takes blistering shot at Vancouver reporter\nThe Province\nCanucks: After coach's criticism, the Elias Pettersson question looms large\nThe Province\nHeart Surgeon Shares 3 Min Routine For Daily Bowel Movements\nGundry MD\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nStop Buying Lottery Tickets & Start Doing This Instead!\nYukon\n|\nSponsored\nClick Here\nBetter than scratching, why you should try this\nDaily Pulse\n|\nSponsored\nCasinos Hate You Doing This.

(Carrier Sekani Child & Family Services photo)\nExpand\n\nFirst Nations leaders and the parents of two missing members of the Saik\u2019uz First Nation are calling for more resources and action to find the missing young people. Indigenous leaders and family spoke at a press conference in Vanderhoof today to request information and action by government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been 24 days since my daughter Chelsea went missing, and we still don\u2019t have any answers,\u201d said a tearful Pam Heron, mother of missing woman Chelsey Quaw (Heron).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying as hard as I can. I have to fight just because his boys deserve to know where he\u2019s at,\u201d said Angie Raphael, mother of missing man Jay Raphael.\n\nChelsey Quaw (Heron) and Jay Preston Raphael are both missing members of the Saik\u2019uz First Nation, located 120 km west of Prince George, just outside Vanderhoof, B.C. and just 14 km south of Highway 16.\n\nHighway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert is known as the Highway of Tears, due to the high number of missing and murdered women in the area, the majority of whom over the years have been Indigenous.\n\nCommunity leaders also shed tears as they spoke at a press conference in Vanderhoof, urging for more resources to be brought to the investigation into the two missing young people.\n\nChief Priscilla Mueller of Saik\u2019uz First Nation thanked all the volunteers who came to participate in the search so far, and said the Saik\u2019uz community had taken the search to Prince George and Vanderhoof as well.\n\nBut she said more needs to be done and more resources are needed.\n\n\u201cThere is only so much the local RCMP can do,\u201d she said, noting they need help from government.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not too sure how we\u2019re going to move forward with the search,\u201d she said.\n\nMary Teegee, executive director of Carrier Sekani Child & Family Service expressed frustration at the lack of action on the 33 recommendations from the 2006 Highway of Tears Symposium Report, which she was also a part of.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m upset that we have to be here again,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere are things we need to think about as a society, how much value are we placing on our Indigenous women, our Indigenous men.\u201d\n\nShe called for more action from both the government, law enforcement and the media to help draw attention to the ongoing issues surrounding missing and murdered Indigenous women and the Highway of Tears. She also referenced the missing women in Manitoba whose remains are believed to be in a landfill.\n\n\u201cIn Canada we\u2019re having to check the landfills for bodies of our missing Indigenous women. Think about that. As a society we have to do better.\u201d\n\nChelsey Quaw is a 29-year-old Indigenous woman with brown hair, brown eyes who vanished from her community last month.\n\nShe stands five feet, 10 inches tall and weighs about 120 pounds. She was possibly wearing blue jeans and a purple winter jacket when she went missing in the early morning hours of Oct. 11, 2023 from a residence on the Saik\u2019uz First Nation.\n\nSeveral search and rescue teams as well as community groups formed search parties to look for Quaw with no results.\n\nJay Preston Raphael has been missing from the community just over eight months.\n\nRaphael is a 28-year-old male with black hair and brown eyes, and unique tattoos on his neck, chest and arm.\n\nHe is five feet, nine inches tall and weighs approximately 143 pounds.\n\nRaphael was last seen on Feb. 25, 2023 at Saik\u2019uz First Nation wearing a black coat, blue jeans black runners and a baseball hat.\n\nSaik\u2019uz First Nation has an on-reserve population of about 400.\n\nLeaders also frequently referenced other missing women from the area. This included Mackie Basil, missing from Tl\u2019azt\u2019en Nation Nation, since 2013, Bonnie Joseph of Yekooche First Nation, missing from near Vanderhoof since 2008, Ramona Wilson of Gitxan First Nation, who went missing in 1994 and whose remains were found near Smithers in 1995. Her murder remains unsolved. They also mentioned Madison Scott and the ongoing search for justice in her case. Scott had been missing since 2011 and her remains were found earlier this year near Vanderhoof, but no charges have yet been laid as the investigation is ongoing.\n\nAnyone with any information can contact Vanderhoof RCMP at 250-567-2222 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.\n\nREAD MORE: Mother of missing Vanderhoof woman says she would never just take off\n\nREAD MORE: RCMP renews public assistance call to locate missing man\n\nREAD MORE: Search continues for missing Vanderhoof woman Chelsey Quaw\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n\nAbout the Author: Ruth Lloyd\n\nI moved back to my hometown of Williams Lake after living away and joined the amazing team at the Williams Lake Tribune in 2021.\nRead more\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tInternist enjoys working in Williams Lake area\n\t\tPHOTOS: 96th Annual Williams Lake Stampede wraps on Canada Day\n\t\tCanada Day celebrated in Boitanio Park in Williams Lake\n\t\tPHOTOS: Day 3 96th annual Williams Lake Stampede done, dusted\n\t\tMen provide some helping hands at Williams Lake community garden\nFacebook Comments (0) \nYOUR VOTE MATTERS\nLooks like you have voted in all of our community polls.

Chris Gareau photo\n\nThe loss of cell service on the stretch of Highway 16 between Smithers and the Hazeltons will soon be a thing of the past.\n\nConstruction of a Rogers cell tower began in late September and is expected to be completed in the coming months.\n\nWitset will be the last First Nation along the northern stretch of the TransCanada Highway to not have cell service, according to a release from the B.C. Ministry of Citizen\u2019 Services.\n\nB.C. Citizens\u2019 Services Minister Jinny Sims was in Witset to make the announcement Friday.\n\n\u201cWe have to look at reducing the digital divide because without reducing the digital divide, the economic participation cannot be there,\u201d Sims told the gathered crowd.\n\n\u201cWhen I travel through areas around the province, I hear about everyday challenges about having cell service. When there\u2019s an emergency on the highway or a loved one is dealing with a crisis such as the threat of forest fires or flash flooding, the last thing they want to see \u2014 which we saw on the drive to here \u2014 was no service,\u201d added Sims.\n\nProvincial and local leaders hope this will help end the notoriety of the artery for northern B.C., dubbed the Highway of Tears because of the many women \u2014 mostly Indigenous women \u2014 who have been murdered or disappeared from Prince George to Prince Rupert.\n\nWitset Chief Victor Jim said even just having the ability to call for a ride instead of being forced to hitchhike should help make things safer.\n\nPriscilla Naziel, a first responder and social development manager in Witset, gave moving examples of how not having that connectivity affected her and the people she tries to help.\n\nShe described what they had to deal with during the search and rescue operation to try to find missing mushroom picker Frances Brown.\n\nREAD MORE: Searchers from across BC seek Frances Brown north of Smithers\n\n\u201cOur [handheld fire department] radios didn\u2019t go all the way up \u2026 and people had to travel all the way down basically to the CN tracks before we could use the cell service. And that was done for a while until the inReach [satellite communication] came in. And I was also told that because their was no cell service they couldn\u2019t use their GPS to find that cell that [Brown] had,\u201d said Naziel.\n\nWhile she acknowledged poverty was a problem in the community that kept people from having communication devices \u2014 even landline phones \u2014 there was a harrowing incident that suggested even one person in a crowd with a working cell phone could be life saving, and the over reliance on handheld radios.\n\nIn this case, people were lucky to have survived without it.\n\n\u201cThere was a possible four-person overdose, and our radios were kicking in and out. But people did get their medical attention and none passed away, for which I\u2019m thankful for,\u201d said Naziel.\n\nAnother example she listed a person who was injured and a passerby who couldn\u2019t find a working landline nearby, eventually reaching the rec centre to call for help.\n\n\u201cIt was actually an assault and the person had a broken shin. So I just don\u2019t know how long that person was bleeding out,\u201d said Naziel, pointing out this person was again lucky to get the medical attention they needed, but that time frame was a problem.\n\nThere were more specific stories to make her point, but then she discussed more general considerations.\n\n\u201cThere are 76 elders in our community, and some are disabled,\u201d she said.\n\nWitset considered getting LifeLine buttons for them, but she pointed out that requires a phone or cable hooked up.\n\n\u201cAgain, the poverty comes into it, and paying for this LifeLine,\u201d said Naziel.\n\nSafety was also top of mind to help first responders who drive around trying to get a signal if they don\u2019t have a radio on them. Another example was the flood this year that had Witset staff going door to door instead of being able to reach people quickly on their phone or via a mass notification similar to the one Smithers has through Everbridge.\n\nREAD MORE: Smithers launches emergency notification system\n\n\u201cJust last May, 11 homes were directly affected by an evacuation due to a flood \u2026 Our sewer station was down so all the other houses were affected, too. But the incident operations commander had to go up the road to do his texting, do his phoning \u2014 go back down, go back up, go back down,\u201d described Naziel.\n\n\u201cIt took time away from the actual incident.\u201d\n\nChastity Davis, chair of the minister\u2019s advisory council on Indigenous women, said in a media release that cell service will end isolation for women travelling along the highway.\n\n\u201cBetter cell phone coverage means women can reach loved ones or emergency services in times of need, and it will create security and reassurance to everyone travelling on Highway 16,\u201d Davis said.\n\nStikine MLA and Rural Development Minister Doug Donaldson acknowledged the safety aspect before giving an example of how important this is economically.\n\n\u201cA few years ago I was at the finger joint mill doing the tour and talking to some of the folks there and they were saying \u2014 I think some of the machinery is from Germany \u2014 and some of the technicians come and when there\u2019s some troubleshooting to do they actually phone in to an office \u2026 and as they\u2019re looking at the machine they\u2019re getting guidance on how to \u2026 fix the problem. They were kind of blown away that they couldn\u2019t do that. Even walking to the church to get reception doesn\u2019t work because they need the machine in front of the as they\u2019re trying to troubleshoot,\u201d said Donaldson.\n\nChief Jim said the connectivity would benefit the newly upgraded RV park and campground by the museum.\n\n\u201cThe people that stay there will be appy to hear that they can phone home and let their loved ones know that they\u2019re safe, and that they\u2019re in the best RV park in the Bulkley Valley,\u201d said Jim.\n\nWhen operational, the cell tower will enable voice, data and text services via high-speed wireless and internet coverage on 4G and LTE networks for Rogers and Fido customers. Customers using other providers will be able to dial 911 in the community and along the highway.\n\nThe new tower is providing wireless coverage to an additional 22 kilometres along the highway.\n\nRick Sellers, B.C. president for Rogers Communications, experienced the lack of service firsthand as he drove from Smithers to Witset.\n\n\u201cOn the way here, [it was] very sporadic. Eventually, we didn\u2019t have coverage during the trip from the airport, so not great. That will change in another two months,\u201d said Sellers.\n\nHe gave his perspective as a visitor on why that connection was so important.\n\n\u201cWe live in a mobile world. Reality is, gone are the days where people are stuck in their offices and have a land line that somebody\u2019s used to calling and you can pick up the phone and say hello. We\u2019re in a world now \u2026 where we now need our devices to stay connected, to stay connected to our families, etc.; so having that was something you take for granted, but when you don\u2019t have it you realize how much dependency you have on those devices,\u201d said Sellers.\n\nHe added that this is not the end of working with the Province to connect northern B.C.\n\n\u201cWe understand it\u2019s important, obviously, to do our part as a corporate citizen. At the same time with the provincial government, it\u2019s one of their clear mandates to make sure we connect remote communities; so we\u2019re making sure we work with them, identifying areas that make sense for us to work together and then roll out as much as we can to connect remote communities,\u201d said Sellers.\n\nThe project is being funded with a $1.2-million grant from the Province through Northern Development Initiative Trust.\n\nUp to six local jobs will be created during construction of the cell tower.\n\neditor@interior-news.com\n\nB.C.

We wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation,\u201d Teegee told CTV News Tuesday. \u201cEveryone would have been up in arms\u2014the community, the municipality, businesses\u2014everyone would have been rallying around. That isn\u2019t the same response we have when there\u2019s a young Indigenous woman.\u201d\n\nTeegee called on the government to implement the 33 calls for actions outlined in 2006 by the Highway of Tears Symposium, which remain unfulfilled, as do the 231 calls for justice delivered by the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in 2019.\n\n\u201cThe issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls is not a B.C. problem \u2013 it\u2019s a Canada-wide one,\u201d says Teegee. \u201cWe really need to come together to address what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nQuaw was one of two community members missing from the First Nation this year.\n\nJay Raphael, 28, was reported missing on Feb. 26 after walking away from a residence.\n\nThe Heron-Quaw family addressed his absence in their statement, urging the public to contact Vanderhoof RCMP with file #2023-477 with any information on his whereabouts.\n\n\u201cWe support all search efforts to bring Jay home,\u201d wrote the family.\n\nAnyone with information about Quaw\u2019s disappearance and death is asked to contact Mounties at the same number and quote file #2023-2794.\n\nAnonymous tips can be made to Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.\n\nHer family is thanking everyone who helped with the search, including the Nechako Search and Rescue Team; the chiefs, councils and communities of Saik\u2019uz and Stellat\u2019en First Nations; CSFS and the RCMP.\n\nWith files from CTV News Vancouver's Spencer Harwood and The Canadian Press\u00a0\n\nRELATED IMAGES\n1 / 1\nThis photo of Chelsey Quaw was shared on Facebook with a statement from her family.

Wear a red dress or red shirt to remember Missing or Murdered Indigenous Women in Canada. Photo provided\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt is that time of year again when First Nations and supporters draw together to remember the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women in Canada as part of the REDress Project.\n\nAlgoma-Manitoulin Kapuskasing MP Carol Hughes says the movement started in Colombia and has spread to other countries including Canada and now the United States.\n\nShe says since its inception, she was impressed by how the advocates used such a simple object, a red dress, to symbolize loss and grief and the importance of not forgetting the women lost to violence.\n\nHughes points out it is now being used to amplify the other voices of those who are marginalized including those in the LGBTQ2+ and Indigenous communities.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHughes adds she will do her part to mark Red Dress Day this Wednesday, May 5th.\n\nThe brainchild of visual artist Jamie Black, the REDress Project is rooted in political action that the artist witnessed in Colombia in 2010.\u00a0That\u2019s when she saw a group of women wearing red dresses and demonstrating over missing family members who have been \u2018disappeared\u2019, a consistent feature of that country\u2019s decades-long struggle with armed conflict.\n\nBlack recognized the parallel between those Colombian women and the families of Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women (MMIW) in Canada.\n\nThis was also at the same time as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was starting to hold events across the country.\u00a0The project dovetailed nicely with the spirit of the times and soon grew beyond Black\u2019s installations taking on a life of its own in public spaces and on social media.\n\nSince its inception, I have been more than impressed with the energy and determination attached to the REDress Project. This important and symbolic campaign uses a simple object to convey so many concepts along with strong emotions.\n\nNow, it is also being used to amplify other voices that have been marginalized, specifically two-spirit, lesbian, gay, trans, bisexual, queer, questioning, intersex and asexual individuals who have faced similar discriminatory and violent behaviour.\n\nThe project is also transcending borders with red dresses being displayed in this manner in the United States too.\u00a0The MMIW crisis is similar in that country with Indigenous women being murdered at a rate of ten times the national average.\n\nGiven America\u2019s long history, it is incredible to consider that the current administration is the first to include a Native American, Deb Haaland who is serving as Secretary of the Interior.\u00a0She recently announced the US will set up a special unit to investigate MMIW.\n\nIn Canada, we have undertaken a National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls which only concluded with its report a few years back in 2019.\u00a0The legacy of that work can be tied to the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and may represent a real turn in the road for our country.\u00a0The website for the National Inquiry is a treasure trove of information and includes a Gallery of Artistic Expression which showcases an incredible range of talent and multiple works rooted in loss and the MMIW phenomenon.\n\nWhile viewing the gallery I was reminded of the work of Espanola resident Christie Belcourt. Already recognized as a talented artist, she is the creator and lead coordinator of Walking With Our Sisters, a 2012 art installation commemorating the MMIW of Canada and the United States. Like Black\u2019s work, this project has toured North America with the help of local activists and continues to inspire action.\n\nPart of the ingenuity of the REDress project is its simplicity and the use of the dress as a motif has certainly grown to the point that we mark Red Dress Day on May 5.\u00a0\n\nIn 2018, it was central to the inception of the Lil\u2019 Red Dress Campaign that sold red dress-shaped pins to raise money towards the costs of creating and installing missing person signage on Vancouver Island.\u00a0The dresses also show up in beadwork, paintings, photographs, and other forms of artistic expression.\u00a0\n\nBy hanging red dresses in public spaces, we can challenge society to come to terms with violence that should never be allowed to define us.\u00a0In a sense, these dresses are revoking permission from abusers and reclaiming public spaces, one dress at a time.\n\nThis is an important step on our journey towards reconciliation, which can\u2019t even begin without understanding.\n\n- Advertisement -\nFacebookTwitterReddItWhatsAppEmail\n- Advertisment -\n- Advertisment -\n- Advertisement -\nContinue Reading\nNews\nAncient burial grounds found on Blind River golf course\nNews\nDollar Tree opens in Espanola today\nNews\nNew regional medical van unveiled\nNews\nNOSDA AGM being held in Sudbury\nNews\nPride Parade to be held in Serpent River First Nation\nNews\nCommunity Living Espanola hosting a walk\nNews\nEspanola\u2019s Christi Belcourt featured on stamp\nNews\nMedical van unveiling today in Espanola\nLOAD MORE\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\nIN THE NEWS\n\nAncient burial grounds found on Blind River golf course\n \nDollar Tree opens in Espanola today\n \nNew regional medical van unveiled\n \nNOSDA AGM being held in Sudbury\n \nPride Parade to be held in Serpent River First Nation\nCommunity Living Espanola hosting a walk\n \nEspanola\u2019s Christi Belcourt featured on stamp\n \nMedical van unveiling today in Espanola\n \nGo Fund Me set up for Manitoulin Island family\n \nFlags lowered in Elliot Lake in remembering Algo Mall collapse\nCrash closes HWY 17 near Nairn Centre\n \nManitoulin manor opens new garden for residents\n \nNairn Park opening \u2013 baseball field revamped\n \nBlessing of the Bikes well attended \u2013 assists Massey girl\n \n2024 Veteran Banner Applications are now being accepted\nCanadian Indigenous Music\n \nNews Alerts Sign Up!\n \nMoose Mornings with Ty Demerah\nNews\nWin\nEvents\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nWe\u2019re Hiring!"},

In response, Instagram released a tweet saying that this was \u201ca widespread global technical issue not related to any particular topic,\u201d followed by an apology explaining that the platform \u201cexperienced a technical bug, which impacted millions of people\u2019s stories, highlights and archives around the world.\u201d\n\nCreators, however, said that not all stories were affected.\n\nAnd this is not the first time social media platforms have been under scrutiny because of their erroneous censoring of grassroots activists and racial minorities.\n\nMany Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists were similarly frustrated when Facebook flagged their accounts, but didn\u2019t do enough to stop racism and hate speech against Black people on their platform.\n\nSo were these really about technical glitches? Or did they result from the platforms\u2019 discriminatory and biased policies and practices? The answer lies somewhere in between.\n\nTowards automated content moderation\n\nEvery time an activist\u2019s post is wrongly removed, there are at least three possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, sometimes the platform deliberately takes down activists\u2019 posts and accounts, usually at request of and/or in co-ordination with the government. This happened when Facebook and Instagram removed posts and accounts of Iranians who expressed support for the Iranian general Qassem Soleiman.\n\nIn some countries and disputed territories, such as Kashmir, Crimea, Western Sahara and Palestinian territories, platforms censored activists and journalists to allegedly maintain their market access or to protect themselves from legal liabilities.\n\nSecond, a post can be removed through a user-reporting mechanism. To handle unlawful or prohibited communication, social media platforms have indeed primarily relied on users reporting.\n\nApplying community standards developed by the platform, content moderators would then review reported content and determine whether a violation had occurred. If it had, the content would be removed, and, in the case of serious or repeat infringements, the user may be temporarily suspended or permanently banned.\n\nThis mechanism is problematic. Due to the sheer volume of reports received on a daily basis, there are simply not enough moderators to review each report adequately. Also, complexities and subtleties of language pose real challenges. Meanwhile, marginalized groups reclaiming abusive terms for public awareness, such as BLM and MMIWG, can be misinterpreted as being abusive.\n\nFurther, in flagging content, users tend to rely on partisanship and ideology. User reporting approach is driven by popular opinion of a platform\u2019s users while potentially repressing the right to unpopular speech.\n\nSuch approach also emboldens freedom to hate, where users exercise their right to voice their opinions while actively silencing others. A notable example is the removal by Facebook of \u201cFreedom for Palestine,\u201d a multi-artist collaboration posted by Coldplay, after a number of users reported the song as \u201cabusive.\u201d\n\nThird, platforms are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to help identify and remove prohibited content. The idea is that complex algorithms that use natural language processing can flag racist or violent content faster and better than humans possibly can. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media companies are relying more on AI to cover for tens of thousands of human moderators who were sent home. Now, more than ever, algorithms decide what users can and cannot post online.\n\nAlgorithmic biases\n\nThere\u2019s an inherent belief that AI systems are less biased and can scale better than human beings. In practice, however, they\u2019re easily disposed to error and can impose bias on a colossal systemic scale.\n\nIn two 2019 computational linguistic studies, researchers discovered that AI intended to identify hate speech may actually end up amplifying racial bias.\n\nIn one study, researchers found that tweets written in African American English commonly spoken by Black Americans are up to twice more likely to be flagged as offensive compared to others. Using a dataset of 155,800 tweets, another study found a similar widespread racial bias against Black speeches.\n\nWhat\u2019s considered offensive is bound to social context; terms that are slurs when used in some settings may not be in others. Algorithmic systems lack an ability to capture nuances and contextual particularities, which may not be understood by human moderators who test data used to train these algorithms either. This means natural language processing which is often perceived as an objective tool to identify offensive content can amplify the same biases that human beings have.\n\nAlgorithmic bias may jeopardize some people who are already at risk by wrongly categorizing them as offensive, criminals or even terrorists. In mid 2020, Facebook deleted at least 35 accounts of Syrian journalists and activists on the pretext of terrorism while in reality, they were campaigning against violence and terrorism.\n\nProtesters gather in Winnipeg the day after the jury delivered a not-guilty verdict in the second degree murder trial of Raymond Cormier, the man accused of killing Tina Fontaine. MMIWG activists had their posts removed from Instagram on a day to raise awareness. THE CANADIAN PRESS/John Woods\n\nMMIWG, BLM and the Syrian cases exemplify the dynamic of \u201calgorithms of opression\u201d where algorithms reinforce older oppressive social relations and re-install new modes of racism and discrimination.\n\nWhile AI is celebrated as autonomous technology that can develop away from human intervention, it is inherently biased. The inequalities that underpin bias already exist in society and influence who gets the opportunity to build algorithms and their databases, and for what purpose. As such, algorithms do not intrinsically provide ways for marginalized people to escape discrimination, but they also reproduce new forms of inequality along social, racial and political lines.\n\nDespite the apparent problems, algorithms are here to stay. There is no silver bullet, but one can take steps to minimize bias. First is to recognize that there\u2019s a problem. Then, making a strong commitment to root out algorithmic biases.\n\nBias can infiltrate the process anywhere in designing algorithms.\n\nThe inclusion of more people from diverse backgrounds within this process \u2014 Indigenous, racial minorities, women and other historically marginalized groups \u2014 is one of important steps to help mitigate the bias. In the meantime, it is important to push platforms to allow for as much transparency and public oversight as possible.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI)\nFacebook\nSocial media\nAlgorithm\nInstagram\nBlack Lives Matter\nBLM\nMonitoring\nmissing and murdered Indigenous women and girls\nMMIWG\nWant to write?\n\nWrite an article and join a growing community of more than 186,300 academics and researchers from 4,990 institutions.\n\nRegister now\n\nEditorial Policies\nCommunity standards\nRepublishing guidelines\nAnalytics\nOur feeds\nGet newsletter\nWho we are\nOur charter\nOur team\nOur blog\nPartners and funders\nResource for media\nContact us\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nPrivacy policy\nTerms and conditions\nCorrections\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010\u20132024, Academic Journalism Society"},

B.C. already has its answer\nJUSTINE HUNTER\nVICTORIA\nPUBLISHED NOVEMBER 8, 2015\n\nThis article was published more than 8 years ago. Some information may no longer be current.\n\nCOMMENTS\nSHARE\n\nTodd Stone, the B.C. Minister of Transportation, wants to hear from residents who live along the Highway 16 corridor in the north. His ministry is hosting a symposium in Smithers, B.C., on Nov. 24 to ask First Nations communities to help him find solutions to the well-documented challenges of keeping women and girls safe along what is known as the Highway of Tears.\n\nThe reasons for this round of consultation are inexplicable.\n\nMr. Stone already has a shelf full of reports and documents \u2013 internal and public \u2013 to guide him, much of it based on extensive consultation over the past decade.\n\nHe could start by looking at the findings of his ministry's 2006 Transportation Symposium. The resulting report is dedicated to nine young women and teenaged girls who disappeared or were found murdered along the highway. Most were aboriginal and most were last seen hitchhiking along Highway 16. The total number of victims is unknown but at least 18 women and girls have vanished in the region since 1969.\n\nNine years ago, the transportation ministry was urged to provide a free shuttle-bus system to connect nearby communities so that vulnerable women would have an alternative to hitchhiking.\n\nMr. Stone could also find some answers in the 2012 Missing Women Commission of Inquiry report. The inquiry held seven meetings in the region. The commission heard a \"generalized frustration about the government's lack of action to address the factors that contribute to the vulnerability of girls and young women along Highway 16: poverty and lack of transportation. We were told that the government continually conducts studies and surveys, but nothing is ever done with the information.\"\n\nIn its final report tabled three years ago, the commission called for urgent action by the B.C. government \"to develop and implement an enhanced public-transit system to provide a safer travel option connecting the Northern communities, particularly along Highway 16.\"\n\nWhile most British Columbians have access to public transit, the ministry seems confounded by the challenges of serving this remote region. There are 23 First Nations communities living along that 724-kilometre stretch of highway struggling to access recreation, medical treatment or other services.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, the ministry launched another round of consultation. From that, Mr. Stone concluded that public transportation was not a practical solution.\n\n\"We knew this couldn't be true because my colleagues and I drove that highway, met with community members along that highway and were told first-hand the very opposite of what the minister has said,\" NDP MLA Maurine Karagianis told the legislature last week. The NDP filed a Freedom of Information request, which took a year to extract from the government. \"Guess what? We were correct. The FOI shows that the people in the northwest actually did tell this government that they wanted public transportation.\"\n\nTerry Teegee, chief of the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council, also questioned the ministry's claims about what the community wants. He said the message from First Nations in the region has been consistent: They believe a reliable, safe transportation system is an essential service. But the ministry insisted the region no longer considered public transit a priority. His organization asked for the consultation report but got nothing back.\n\nMr. Stone's ministry deserves the skepticism. The province's independent privacy commissioner has asked the RCMP to investigate how his ministry responded to information requests on the Highway of Tears by deleting documents.\n\nWhy is it so hard to accept that the community along Highway 16 wants access to some form of public transit? The only reasonable conclusion is that the stakeholders in the region haven't said what Mr. Stone wants to hear.\n\nThe government has estimated the cost of running a free shuttle service at $1-million a year. Coming from a government that has cooked up a $3-billion plan for the George Massey tunnel replacement in Metro Vancouver without bothering to produce a business plan, it is disgraceful that the province is applying such rigorous penny-pinching while young women are at risk.\n\nSign up for the B.C.

(Brittany Caffet/650 CKOM)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Chanelle Gamble, Red Dress Day is far more than just another day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very passionate about this, because I\u2019ve had some of my family members who have gone missing and who have been murdered as well,\u201d she said.\n\nThe National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People \u2014 otherwise known as Red Dress Day \u2014 is held annually on May 5.\n\nA Statistics Canada report from last year showed that Indigenous women and girls were murdered at a rate six times higher than those who were not Indigenous.\n\nGamble, a 23-year-old Plains Cree woman who works at Wanuskewin Heritage Park as an Interpretive Guide and a fancy shawl dancer, said the statistics surrounding missing and murdered Indigenous women have left a sense of fear hanging over her as she navigates life.\n\n\u201cIt makes me fearful to even go anywhere by myself,\u201d she said.\n\nShe led her very first workshop at Wanuskewin on Sunday, honouring the cause that is so close to her heart by sharing her knowledge and teaching a group of people how to create beaded red dress earrings.\n\n\u201cI taught myself how to make this design in support of the cause, and I wanted to be able to teach other people,\u201d she said, adding that the earrings are great conversation starters.\n\n\u201cWearing a piece of jewelry that shows the red dress makes people curious. They wonder \u2018What does that mean? Why the red dress?'\u201d\n\nChanelle Gamble, 23, works at Wanuskewin Heritage Park as an Interpretive Guide and a Fancy Shawl Dancer. On Sunday she led her very first workshop at the park, teaching attendees how to make beaded red dress earrings. (Brittany Caffet/650 CKOM)\n\nThe first Red Dress Day took place in 2014, inspired by the work of Canadian M\u00e9tis artist Jaime Black.\n\nBlack took hundreds of red dresses and hung them in public places to represent missing and murdered Indigenous women. The art installation turned the red dress into a symbol that represents the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women.\n\n\u201cIt represents how the women should be wearing that dress,\u201d said Gamble. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be missing. They shouldn\u2019t be murdered.\u201d\n\nOver the years, many people have expressed their support on Red Dress Day by hanging red dresses outside of their homes or wearing articles of clothing or jewelry to commemorate the day.\n\nThanks to Gamble, the group of women who attended the workshop now have their own red dress earrings to wear.\n\nThose taking part in the workshop said they were grateful for the opportunity to learn, and will be wearing their new earrings with pride.\n\nThe group made beaded red dress earrings in honour of the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People. (Brittany Caffet/650 CKOM)\n\nGamble said she believes items created in recognition of Red Dress Day are for everyone to wear, not just those of Indigenous heritage.\n\n\u201cIf you want to wear red dress earrings or a ribbon skirt, by all means wear a ribbon skirt. Just showing that support is really what\u2019s important,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also said these items should be worn year round \u2014 not only on May 5 \u2014 to help raise awareness of the issue.\n\n\u201cThose women should be honoured every single day,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the goal of this project.\u201d\n\nDiscover more on CKOM.com\nSask.

Along with many others who\u2019ve lost their loved ones, she spends the day remembering her sister who went missing in 2008.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of women that are going missing and being murdered. And we know that there\u2019s a lot of men as well, Indigenous men going missing,\u201d said Smith. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for Canadians \u2026 to know that no one\u2019s immune to this.\u201d\n\nRed Dress Day is an annual event that is dedicated to honouring Canada\u2019s missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirited people. Red dresses are hung to symbolize the lives lost.\n\nCarol McBride, head of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, said this is an ongoing emergency.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a mother. I\u2019m a sister. I\u2019m an aunt,\u201d said McBride. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just imagining some of our families and our women are suffering right now.\u201d\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a report last year, Statistics Canada reported that 63 per cent of Indigenous women experienced violence while nearly half experienced sexual assault.\n\nEdmonton's breaking news sent to your email as it happens.\n\nWinnipeg has been called ground zero for many of these incidents.\n\n1:04\nMMIWG2S+ Walk for Justice\n\nHere in the city, people gathering for a round dance at Portage Avenue and Main Street, and later marched down to the Forks.\n\nSimilarly, at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, a special display was set up consisting of hundreds of items from Indigenous survivors, families, and even artists. The display can be viewed for free until May 7.\n\nThe items on display include red dresses, quilts, and banners, and are part of a bundle from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn order for this to change, it\u2019s going to take societal change in how we treat one another, support one another, and make sure that those supports are there for folks that need (them),\u201d said Smith.\n\nSmith is a member of provincial parliament representing Point Douglas and is one of the founders of Drag the Red, a volunteer organization that searches in and around the Red River for missing and murdered Indigenous women.\n\nA report that looked into those who were missing and murdered was released in 2019.

PHOTO BY KEVIN KING /Winnipeg Sun\nArticle content\n\nWhat started as a one-off community event that organizers hoped would attract a few hundred runners, the Foodfare-Winnipeg Police Service Half Marathon celebrated its 20th running on Sunday, blessed by perfect weather.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cIt got to 400, 500, 600 and we stopped selling (registrations) at 1,000 and then we realized that it was such a good fundraiser for the cancer society that we just needed to keep going,\u201d recalled race director Nick Paulet, who organized the first race with his wife and a couple of friends. \u201cWhat really keeps us all going is this day. In the week leading up (to race day), it\u2019s a very long week for the team with a lot of long days and I tell the new guys, \u2018Just wait until Sunday.\u2019 Sunday comes and everybody is hugging, they\u2019re happy with each other. Year One I definitely didn\u2019t think so (that it would last) but it all makes sense now.\u201d\n\nThe Foodfare-WPS Half Marathon, Two-Person Relay and 5K event officially kicks off Manitoba\u2019s running season. This year, more than 2,000 runners took part.\n\nThe Winnipeg Sun's Daily Headline News\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nParticipants are shown support during the 20th running of the Winnipeg Police Service half marathon on Sunday, May 5, 2024. PHOTO BY KEVIN KING /Winnipeg Sun\n\n\u201cThe 20th is obviously an incredible mile marker for us, no pun intended being that it\u2019s a half marathon,\u201d said Paulet. \u201cBut I think what we really look at right now is the fact that we have 2,000 runners post-COVID coming back. The entire running community is strong and for us especially as police officers it\u2019s a great reminder and a chance to engage with the community to show just how positive a community and support we have. It\u2019s also for the cause of cancer research and that\u2019s what really binds us all together.\u201d\n\nAll monies raised from this year\u2019s event go to the Canadian Cancer Society to support research in Manitoba to help children affected by brain cancer.\n\n\u201c(Cancer is) unfortunately one of those things that ties us all together and it\u2019s fortunately one of those things that ties us all together,\u201d said Paulet. \u201cIt allows us to come together on a day like today and unify behind a cause.\u201d\n\nRunners are shown support during the 20th Winnipeg Police Service half marathon on Sunday, May 5, 2024. PHOTO BY KEVIN KING /Winnipeg Sun\n\nFoodfare has been a main sponsor from the very beginning.\n\n\u201cWe were honoured to be asked in the beginning,\u201d said Foodfare\u2019s Munther Zeid. \u201cBeing one of small guys to be asked to participate in something like this, we were very honoured. We sort of understand the feeling of somebody starting new and wanting support and being backed for something like this. After 20 years, it\u2019s good to know that this event from the start of it to now has been supported and funded by Winnipeggers and Manitobans only.\u201d\n\nLike many of the runners and many families in Manitoba, Zeid\u2019s family has been touched by cancer. Back in 2011, Zeid\u2019s eldest son Wajih was diagnosed and treated for testicular cancer.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\nToggle full screen mode\nPrevious Gallery Image\nParticipants are shown support during the 20th running of the Winnipeg Police Service half marathon on Sunday, May 5, 2024.

One pipe is equivalent to smoking 40 to 100 cigarettes, he said.\n\n\u201cThe issue is with the actual act of combustion in terms of burning and heating the shisha product,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though it doesn\u2019t necessarily contain nicotine, we still see all those harmful combustion products from the heating of the shisha, as well as the charcoal that is used for the heating process.\u201d\n\nDr. Jack Pang, north zone medical officer of health for AHS, said public smoking increases smoking\u2019s appeal for youth and young adults. The shared use of a waterpipe also leads to higher risk of infectious diseases.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cWe recognize the numerous challenges we\u2019ve all had to face for the past two years and are still facing today,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we certainly should not sacrifice health of the public for economic recovery and growth.\u201d\n\nVentilation systems with the technology to eliminate contaminants such as environmental smoke do not exist, said Norma Bruins, a public health inspector with AHS North Zone.\n\nOnly one presenter supported the motion, though.\u00a0Fort McMurray resident Zakaria Tahlil argued there is demand for hookah lounges in the community and wants to open one. He said restrictions like age limits could be put in place to protect the public.\n\n\u201cThose risks\u2026 they\u2019re there, but these are for people who come into facility and purchase these shisha\u2026 these are people who want to smoke,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nCouncillor Ken Ball said he is a smoker and cannot smoke in any indoor public places. He asked why a hookah lounge should be exempt if shisha smoking carries the same risks to public health.\n\nCouncillor Shafiq Dogar argued the product is a cheaper alternative to tobacco. Despite testimony from healthcare workers, he argued shisha smoking is not dangerous.\n\n\u201cIt has a cultural background\u2026 people sit around it, share their good feelings, share knowledge, spend some good time,\u201d he said.\n\nThe motion was defeated, with only Dogar voting in favour.\n\nPeople march down Franklin Avenue for Red Dress Day in Fort McMurray, Alta. on Thursday, May 5, 2022. The day marks a national day of mourning and awareness for missing, murdered and exploited Indigenous peoples (MMEIP). Vincent McDermott/Fort McMurray Today/Postmedia Network\n\nFunding approved for MMEIP programs\n\nCouncil also approved $230,000 in funding to support the municipality\u2019s work with a local Missing, Murdered and Exploited Indigenous Peoples (MMEIP) taskforce.

We need to learn how to help each other and how to be able to support our neighbouring communities because we\u2019re all connected.\u201d\n\nStephanie Harpe of the MMEIP working group told council the region is behind other communities she has visited when it comes to fighting the MMEIP crisis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that you understand that unity is a part of all of this too and that\u2019s what we need to do is come together, that will be a big part of this lead,\u201d she said.\n\nlbeamish@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\nLATEST NATIONAL STORIES\nNEWS NEAR GRANDE PRAIRIE\nTHIS WEEK IN FLYERS"},

It also includes supports for social profits, mental health and addiction programs, and family violence counselling.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always more work that needs to be done in raising awareness, but I do thing that the tide is turning,\u201d said Peckham. \u201cIn general, a lot of people don\u2019t understand that these systems still exist.\u201d\n\nThe Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada reports Indigenous women are more likely to report physical and sexual violence as a child than men (14 per cent versus five per cent) and three times more likely to report spousal violence than non-Indigenous women.\n\nThe National Inquiry into the MMIWGS2 crisis found perpetrators are often \u201cpartners, casual acquaintances and serial killers.\u201d\n\nStatistics Canada found even with other risk factors, \u201cIndigenous identity itself remained a risk factor for violent victimization of women which was not found for men.\u201d Indigenous LGBTQ2S+ peoples also report high rates of physical and sexual violence.\n\n\u201cThis is all happening across the country and right here in our community,\u201d said Allan Adam, chief of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation and president of the Athabasca Tribal Council. \u201cThis is about making sure people aren\u2019t ignoring it.\u201d\n\nPeople march down Franklin Avenue for Red Dress Day in Fort McMurray, Alta. on Thursday, May 5, 2022.

Joy Flett is the knowledge keeper for her close and extended relatives, but pieces of her family tree have been stolen, and she feels a heartache that is shared by countless other Indigenous families across Canada. Both women will be wearing red on May 5.\n\nAlso known as Red Dress Day, May 5 marks a day to honour, remember and create awareness and action for Missing, Murdered and Exploited Indigenous Peoples (MMEIP) in Canada. The statistics are startling -Indigenous women in Canada today are seven times more likely than non-Indigenous women to be a murder victim, and three times more likely to be violently or sexually assaulted.\n\nLana, originally from Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan, and Joy, from the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation in Alberta, are part of Suncor's Indigenous and Community Relations team in Fort McMurray, Alta. They both agree that more action is needed to end the MMEIP crisis.\n\n\"Since the time of residential schools and everything leading to today, we've been stripped of our names, our languages, our hair. To be able to take back our power and voice, we need to keep speaking out against what is happening,\" says Joy. \"There are so many Indigenous people who've gone missing or have been murdered in our own city. We need to continue to say their names. They are important to somebody. We can all play a role in ending the violence.\"\n\nOne of the national organizations helping to move the needle with this progress is the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC). For almost 50 years NWAC has played a lead role in advocating for the rights of Indigenous women, girls, two-spirit, transgender and gender-diverse people, which includes critical advocacy on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG2S+) and reconciliation. The organization has been pressing the federal government to act since the National Inquiry issued the 231 Calls for Justice in 2019.\n\nWhen reflecting on Red Dress Day, NWAC urges Canadians to consider the many aspects of colonization that continue to affect Indigenous people. NWAC's Chief Executive Officer, Lynne Groulx, believes that a critical component to reconciliation is acknowledging the past.\n\n\"We invite everyone across the country to play an active role in reconciliation through education and raising awareness, as well as learning about Indigenous knowledge systems and the impacts of colonialism and racism that face many Indigenous people,\" says Lynne. \"We have taken urgent and significant action to increase awareness and address the 231 Calls for Justice and have been working hard to implement our own MMIWG2S+ Action Plan.\"\n\nNWAC's Action Plan includes 66 concrete actions they will take to help end the MMEIP. Last year NWAC reported progress on over 85 per cent of the proposed actions. This includes the Safe Passage Platform - a national reporting tool that maps cases of MMIWG2S+ and provides information on resources and services available across the country.\n\nLynne also suggests reading books, listening to podcasts or participating in educational programs created by Indigenous authors and media to see the world through their lens. She also encourages people to help amplify messages and initiatives from Indigenous voices to ensure they are being heard.\n\nOn May 5 and beyond, both Lana and Joy will be found honouring and remembering - the missing, murdered and exploited Indigenous peoples - in their own way of healing and active support.\n\n\"Through my mom's experience growing up of being called a dirty Indian, to now my 15-year-old daughter who is able to stand proud and march to the beat of her own drum, we can see there has been a lot of progress for Indigenous people to feel seen and accepted,\" says Lana. \"But we also must acknowledge the pain and trauma that is still prevalent today. We are not victims, we are survivors.\"\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Suncor Energy on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\nSpokesperson: Suncor Energy\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/suncor-energy\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: Suncor Energy\n\nView source version on accesswire.com:\nhttps://www.accesswire.com/754300/Suncor-Indigenous-Employees-Lana-and-Joy-Want-Everyone-To-Be-an-Ally-on-Red-Dress-Day-and-Beyond\n\n\n\u00a9\u00a02023\u00a0ACCESSWIRE\nSie erhalten auf FinanzNachrichten.de kostenlose Realtime-Aktienkurse von  und .\nFNRD-2.627.0\nWie bewerten Sie die aktuell angezeigte Seite?\nsehr gut123456schlechtProblem melden\nWerbehinweise: Die Billigung des Basisprospekts durch die BaFin ist nicht als ihre Bef\u00fcrwortung der angebotenen Wertpapiere zu verstehen.

Photo supplied.\nArticle content\n\nJust under 200 people showed up to The Legion on Sunday, March 19 for the Fort Saskatchewan Community Round Dance, hosted by the Indigenous Society of Fort Saskatchewan, Family and Community Support Services (FCSS) and the City of Fort Saskatchewan.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nCommunity members filled the Normandy Room at the Legion to listen, learn, and participate in the Community Round Dance. In addition to the round dance the Indigenous Society held a Pipe Ceremony and a feast of soup and bannock.\n\n\u201cIt went really well,\u201d said Colleen Dollfusz, Indigenous Society of Fort Saskatchewan. \u201cOne of our volunteers went around and counted 181 people at one point in the night. We had prepared to serve for 200 people and all of the soup and bannock was eaten, so that was awesome. It was well received and a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nDollfusz says that events like the Community Round Dance help Indigenous people living in the City to connect with their culture.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m new to this, and that\u2019s why we are trying to bring this into our community, because there are a lot of people here like myself, who we call \u2018Urban Native\u2019, and we\u2019ve lost our culture. So this pipe ceremony that we brought together on Sunday was the first pipe ceremony that I\u2019ve been to for many, many years.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing it back into our community for the Urban Native,\u201d explained Dollfusz. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a lot of our culture because we moved into the cities and away from our communities so that we could get a better education and a better lifestyle \u2014 and a lot of us actually weren\u2019t even raised in Aboriginal communities, like myself. There wasn\u2019t an everyday cultural thing, so we lost it. We lost our language, we lost our culture, and we lost our way of life. So to bring it back into the Fort Saskatchewan community where there wasn\u2019t a real aboriginal culture, us Urban Natives can reconnect with our culture and to Creator.\u201d\n\nThe Indigenous Society of Fort Saskatchewan was founded by Colleen Dollusz and Tamara Pawlick to create a space in the community for Indigenous people to come together and have space to practice their culture.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cTammy approached me with idea to start the Society because there was a gap in our community,\u201d said Dollfusz. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything significantly going on with the culture, and we wanted to bring it back into our community.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we really wanted to do was get a cultural centre and space into our community. We\u2019ve been working with the City on trying to find a permanent space where Aboriginal people can come together\u201d\n\nThe Indigenous Society of Fort Saskatchewan is currently hosting Pow Wow dancing celebrations every Wednesday, 6pm at the \u00c9cole Parc \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire gymnasium, and ribbon skirt and shirt sewing classes every Sunday, 2pm at the Bridge Wellness Hub.

She takes her life's lessons seriously, and considers them gifts she is compelled to share. In The Hearts of You & Me carries that weight, but she doesn't swing it like a hammer. The same could be said for her compositions looking at residential schools, domestic abuse, the simple being of aboriginal descent in a colonial society, and all the other issues that come to her in song because they come to her in life.\n\n\"Whenever I am performing and I see people crying in the audience, or when people come up to me to talk about how something I sang moved them somehow, that's when I know for sure I am a messenger,\" said Gouchie. \"I take care of myself, I try to live a healthy life and make good life decisions so I can do this work, because it opens up a lot of doors, a lot of subject matter, that people don't want to talk about. I'm not here to sing happy sunshiny ditties. There is happiness in my songs, the message is always positive, but I'm here to tell stories, I'm here to talk about real topics, using my music.\"\n\nThis authenticity, and her well honed talent (she is a member of a Lheidli T'enneh First Nation family famous for their music. Her brothers Buddy and Mike are also accomplished singer-songwriters) caught the attention of some angel investors. Dean and Diane Ravelli saw her perform in concert and were so impressed, the brother-sister investors became the sponsors of her next album. That album is being recorded now with a fall release as her target.\n\nThe recording process is being done with acclaimed sound engineer Thurein Myint at the controls, in his analog studio in Summerland. In The Hearts of You & Me is the first one completed, and it is already getting radio and download action despite being released to the world only recently.\n\nGouchie will perform the song, give a sneak peek of the upcoming album, and bring in some of her past favourites at a concert on Thursday night at Knox United Church. The church self-sponsored the event, along with UNBC's campus station CFUR, Gouchie herself who is donating most of the proceeds to the Highway Of Tears Initiative, and a grant from the Lheidli T'enneh First Nation.\n\nThe master of ceremonies at the concert will be Highway Of Tears co-ordinator Brenda Wilson, sister of one of the victims of the highway's tragic history, Ramona Wilson. In honour of her sister, and all the other women who have gone missing or been confirmed murdered over the years, Wilson held a walk from Prince Rupert to Prince George and Gouchie, without knowing her, volunteered to walk some of the distance on that journey.\n\n\"A drum song came to me on that walk, and I will be performing it on Thursday with the Khast'an Drummers. Brenda Wilson also helped contribute some of the words to the song, so she will be there too,\" Gouchie said.\n\nOther performers on stage sharing the artistry of the evening will be singer/rapper Tessa Fraser and singer-songwriter Julia Young.\n\n\"I saw Tessa perform at Aboriginal Day and she blew me away,\" Gouchie said. \"She has such an energy. She's not only beautiful, but captivating. She has this powerful presence and you can't take your eyes off her. So I hope this is the beginning of something; I want to work on songs with her.\"\n\nYoung is the daughter of a dear friend Gouchie recently lost to cancer. She pledged to help the aspiring 15-year-old.\n\n\"Music for me has been healing and I strongly feel it will play a big role in Julia's life,\" she said. \"I was a pretty lost teenager myself, I didn't know how to find help or what help even looked like, so now I want to take Julia under my musical wing.\"\n\nFood and refreshments are served at 6 p.m., the music begins at 7 p.m. tomorrow night at the historic church hall at 1448 Fifth Ave. \"There's not a bad seat in the house and the acoustics are amazing,\" Gouchie said.\n\nTickets are available in advance from Angelique's Native Arts (335 Dominion Street) and Carrier Sekani Family Services (987 Fourth Ave), or at the door while supplies last. Prices are $15 in advance or $20 at the door.\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nReport a mistake\nThis has not been shared.

SUBMITTED BY STEPHANIE RIVERS ELICKUS\n\nFor Stephanie Rivers Elickus, a driving force behind the many red dresses hanging along Island highways, Red Dress Day is about reminding people why she hangs those dresses.\n\nToday is National Day of Awareness of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in Canada, or Red Dress Day. The dresses have become a symbol of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in North America.\n\nViolence against Indigenous women and girls is \u201csystemic and a national crisis,\u201d says the Assembly of First Nations, which represents about 900,000 First Nations people in Canada.\n\nIndigenous women and girls are five times more likely to experience violence than any other population in Canada, and Indigenous women make up 16 per cent of all female homicide victims and 11 per cent of \u00admissing women, despite representing just 4.3 per cent of the population, the organization says.\n\nMay 5 is also a day of personal significance for Elickus \u2014 the 29th anniversary of her sister\u2019s murder.\n\n\u201cSo this is really important to me. And it\u2019s really near and dear to me that people get their justice, or they get some action,\u201d she said.\n\nElickus hung 45 red dresses in Campbell River to make a statement marking the day and has planned a vigil in a downtown park to remember the women who never came home.\n\nElickus said she hung her first red dress in the early 2000s and has placed more than 100 along highways from \u00adVictoria to Port Hardy just this year.\n\nWith the help of a network of volunteers, dresses have also been hung on the Gulf Islands and the Sunshine Coast.\n\nThe red dresses act as a symbol of solidarity and are intended to raise awareness.\n\nWhen she hangs a dress, Elickus says a prayer and asks the spirits to call the missing women home.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s speaking for the ones that can\u2019t speak anymore, you know, the silenced,\u201d she said.\n\nShe started a Facebook page this year dedicated to the cause, where she shares stories of women who are missing and photos of red dresses \u00adhanging all over the Island, and tries to raise awareness about the meaning behind the dresses.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still so many that don\u2019t have a clue,\u201d she said.\n\nregan-elliott@timescolonist.com\n\nSee a typo/mistake?\nHave a story/tip?\nThis has been shared 2 times\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nMore Local News\n\tRental truck impounded after speeding driver turns out to be impaired\n\tNanaimo RCMP find illicit drugs, weapons after stopping suspected prohibited driver\n\tPolice seize 20 guns, 20,000 rounds of ammo in raid on Bear Mountain home\nTimes Colonist - Featured\nInjuries reported in Highway 4 crashes on Canada Day weekend\nRead More\nTRENDING TODAY\n6303\t\nFirst heat wave of the summer on the way to Vancouver Island and B.C.\n\n2625\t\nFairway grocery store closing at Westshore Town Centre\n\n2555\t\nSuspect's pants catch fire in arson attempt gone wrong: B.C.

On Thursday, Radek will honour the 12th anniversary of the disappearance of her niece, Tamara Lynn Chipman, by walking the route once again.\n\n\"You can feel the pain of the families when they're walking with you,\" she said. \"It's really, really hard to describe.\"\n\nThe annual journey, made by Radek and others who have lost loved ones, will span five days this year and cover 350 kilometres between Prince Rupert and Smithers. Vehicles will accompany the walkers who will cover sections of the route in a relay fashion.\n\nCommissioners of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls are set to join the walk on Sept. 25 before community hearings are held from Sept. 26 to 28 in Smithers. This is the second set of hearings held to date by the inquiry, after it visited Whitehorse in May.\n\nSince then, the inquiry's executive director, Michele Moreau, and one of its commissioners, Marilyn Poitras, have quit and the Native Women's Association of Ontario has pulled its support. The inquiry has faced growing calls for resignations and a restart.\n\nAsked whether commissioners feel added pressure to ensure these hearings are successful, Chief Commissioner Marion Buller said they feel that obligation regardless.\n\n\"They have to be (successful), not only for our purposes, but more so for the families who come forward and share their stories with us. It's the success from their perspective that's the most important aspect for us,\" she said.\n\n\"We're always under scrutiny. Always. And we always will be,\" she added. \"I'm always open to constructive, informed criticism, as are the other commissioners. It's part of our work.\"\n\nThe federal government launched the inquiry last year to examine the systemic issues behind the high number of Indigenous women who have been killed or disappeared over the last four decades in Canada. It is expected to take two years and cost almost $54 million.\n\nBuller said the commission will ask for more money and time but it is still conducting an internal analysis before making the request.\n\nAbout 25 people, including family members and survivors of violence, are expected to testify publicly or privately at the Dze L K'Ant Friendship Centre next week. A statement-taker will be available for anyone who wishes to speak, with no pre-registration needed, said Buller.\n\nRadek will testify about Chipman, who disappeared while hitchhiking in Prince Rupert on Sept. 21, 2005. The 22-year-old was a beautiful, charming free spirit who had a young son, she recalled.\n\nCritics of the inquiry don't understand how much ground it has to cover, said Radek, who sits on its national family advisory circle.\n\n\"It's not as simple as two years of work. These people, these commissioners and the staff that they have working right now, they are uncovering the stones that should have been turned a long time ago,\" she said.\n\nPeople living along the Highway of Tears had to wait years for the provincial government to carry out a key recommendation of the B.C. inquiry into missing and murdered women, said Terry Tegee, tribal chief of the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council.\n\nThe recommendation \u2014 reliable public transit along the route \u2014 was finally implemented earlier this year. But the experience has led Teegee to call for the federal inquiry to have more teeth. Like the missing inquiry in B.C., the recommendations from the national inquiry will be non-binding.\n\nTeegee also said he's concerned that people in small communities that still lack transit won't be able to participate in the Smithers hearings.\n\nBuller said staff have visited nearby towns in recent weeks to reach out to families and it is able to help cover travel costs including mileage and meals, she said.\n\nThe hearings will be the first of nine this fall, with other stops in Winnipeg, Halifax, Edmonton, Yellowknife, Saskatoon, Sask., Maliotenam, Que., Thunder Bay, Ont., and Rankin Inlet, Nunavut.\n\n\u2014 Follow @ellekane on Twitter.\n\nNews from \u00a9 The Canadian Press, 2017\n\n\nMore News ...\niN RESPONSE: Readers have their say\nFollowing are emailed reader responses to stories or letters to...\nChefs mourn for Okanagan's peaches but adapt to stone fruit wipeout\nKelowna woman loses legal fight with housing co-op over medical cannabis\nFrom no strata fees to discounted golf, Okanagan developers using promos to sell homes\nPopular Kelowna News\nOkanagan contractors fined $19,000 for unsafe building sites\nJuly 02, 2024 6:00 PM\nKamloops homeless day services set to close with no promised replacement\nJuly 03, 2024 6:00 AM\nKelowna breeder wins after being sued over sick Labradoodle\nJuly 03, 2024 7:00 AM\nVernon cabinetmaker ordered to pay $2,500 for shoddy work\nJuly 01, 2024 6:00 AM\n'Merchants of death': Lengthy sentence for Vernon fentanyl dealer\nJuly 01, 2024 6:00 PM\nTop News\nKamloops police investigating targeted gangland shooting\niNwheels\nJuly 04, 2024 1:05 PM\nNo more lengthy delays in Highway 97 rock slide zone near Summerland\niNwheels\nJuly 04, 2024 11:55 AM\nHow to stay cool at work during southern Interior heat wave\nJuly 04, 2024 10:50 AM\nChefs mourn for Okanagan's peaches but adapt to stone fruit wipeout\niNwine\nJuly 04, 2024 9:41 AM\nMan broke into Kelowna construction site, climbed crane\nJuly 04, 2024 7:37 AM\nTrending Now\nTRENDING NOW: Stormtrooper party balloon chaos\nKamloops\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nKamloops Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nKelowna\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nKelowna Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nPenticton\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nPenticton Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nVernon\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nVernon Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\n\u00a9 2024 InfoTel News Ltd\nContact iNFOTEL MULTIMEDIA |\u00a0\nContact iNFOnews |\u00a0\nSubmit News Tips |\u00a0\nPrivacy Policy & Disclaimer |\u00a0\nSitemap |\u00a0\nNewsletter Signup\nView Site in: Desktop | Mobile"},

The day honours missing, murdered and exploited Indigenous people. Vincent McDermott/Fort McMurray Today/Postmedia Network\nArticle content\n\nAt Red Dress Day ceremonies in Fort McMurray, Stephanie Harpe feels there\u2019s still plenty of work to fight the crisis of missing, murdered and exploited Indigenous people (MMEIP). It\u2019s a crisis that many organizers of Sunday\u2019s event said is still not being taken seriously by many people.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cThis day is for our murdered, our missing, our human trafficked, our loved ones that are surviving,\u201d said Harpe, a member of the Fort McKay First Nation and an advocate for MMEIP. \u201cHere in the daytime we exist, but nighttime is when our people have to survive. Red Dress Day is every single day until we are safe and can walk down the street and feel OK.\u201d\n\nHarpe wishes more people would talk about human trafficking in Canada, and what police and governments are doing and not doing about the crisis. She also wishes more grassroots movements allowed larger leadership and advisory roles for survivors and families of victims.\n\nIt\u2019s a cause that has impacted her personally. Harpe struggled with addictions at 14, and was stalked and nearly murdered in Edmonton. Her mother, Ruby Anne McDonald, was murdered in Edmonton in 1999.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cWhen I got well, I just knew I had a responsibility to share this truth of surviving the streets, gangs, crime syndicates. As a survivor, I can speak to it,\u201d said Harpe. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things we\u2019re still not talking about. This is a day of awareness of elevating the voices that are silenced.\u201d\n\nStephanie Harpe, an activist for missing, murdered and exploited Indigenous people, at a Red Dress Day round dance at Kiyam Community Park in downtown Fort McMurray on May 5, 2024. Vincent McDermott/Fort McMurray Today/Postmedia Network\n\nRed Dress Day is held every year on May 5. It began as a way to honour the memories of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people (MMIWG2S). In the Fort McMurray Wood Buffalo region, some organizers have embraced the MMEIP acronym.\n\nIn Fort McMurray, people met at Kiyam Community Park. Hundreds of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people marched up Morrison Street, along Selby Avenue and down Hardin Street towards Franklin Avenue. The rest of the day included a public community lunch and a memorial round dance with drummers.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe names of victims were on signs, banners and clothing. Red dresses could be found hanging from trees, buildings and signs across the region.\n\nPeople march through downtown Fort McMurray on May 5, 2024. Red Dress Day honours missing, murdered and exploited Indigenous people. Vincent McDermott/Fort McMurray Today/Postmedia Network\n\nMMEIP bigger local crisis than people realize\n\nJes Croucher, president of the Nistawoyou Association Friendship Centre,\u00a0says the crisis is much larger in Fort McMurray Wood Buffalo than people realize. A local database dating back to the early 1970s has the names of 55 Indigenous people who are murdered or missing in the region.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done. This crisis is the result of historical, intergenerational and present-day trauma. We need supports in all different ways to allow us to be who we are and heal in our own way,\u201d she said.\n\nThe most recent Statistics Canada data from 2022 found Indigenous people represented 27 per cent of homicide victims reported that year. The National Inquiry into the MMIWGS2 crisis found perpetrators are often \u201cpartners, casual acquaintances and serial killers.\u201d\n\nStatistics Canada also notes \u201cIndigenous identity itself remained a risk factor for violent victimization of women which was not found for men.\u201d Indigenous 2SLGBTQI+ peoples also report high rates of physical and sexual violence.\n\nThe Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada reports Indigenous women are more likely to report physical and sexual violence as a child than men (14 per cent versus five per cent) and three times more likely to report spousal violence than non-Indigenous women.\n\n\u201cI hope people realize how much of a hotspot Fort McMurray is for this,\u201d said Mitchel Bowers, chair of Pride YMM and a two-spirit Metis person. \u201cThere\u2019s always more work to be done.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\nToggle full screen mode\nPrevious Gallery Image\nA woman marches through downtown Fort McMurray while carrying the names of with the names of Amber Tuccaro, Sherri Flett and Ellie Herman on Red Dress Day on May 5, 2024.

(Special to The News)\nListen to this article\n00:03:15\n\nStudents at Garibaldi Secondary School collectively walked about the distance between Prince George and Terrace to raise money for women and those who identify as women on the Downtown Eastside.\n\nThe fundraiser was in honour of Red Dress Day, a national day of awareness for murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls on May 5, and included a presentation on the history of the day, and a history of the Highway of Tears.\n\nSystemic failures and barriers that many Indigenous women and their families experience when reporting and dealing with police were also discussed.\n\nStudents researched the names of women, girls, those who identify as two-spirit, and others who are part of the murdered and missing Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit crisis. They wrote the names of the people they researched on little red dresses which they pinned to their clothing as they walked 1,352 laps around the school\u2019s track \u2013 about 550 kilometres.\n\n\u201cWe included a video of one of the walks on the Highway of Tears to ensure the students could hear directly from the community. Due to the significance of the day, it was important to us to meaningfully front-load the classes and students to assist with an overall understanding of why we are choosing to work together as a community to bring awareness to the national issue, said Sofie Van De Keere, a French teacher at the school and one of four organizers of the event. Other organizers included Beth MacDougall, Emma Daignault, and Becky Chappell-Moss \u2013 all members of the school\u2019s Anti-Racism and Equity Committee, formed in October 2022. The committee works to create initiatives throughout the school year in hopes of celebrating the diverse natures of students and staff like Cultural Days, guest speakers, and awareness for problems of inequity in our community.\n\nRELATED: First Nations leaders in B.C. call for action on Red Dress Day\n\nVan De Keere said both the research and walk helped students understand the crisis on a human level, as opposed to focusing on the numbers of women who have gone missing or been murdered.\n\nThis was the first year that Garibaldi Secondary had a mandatory school-wide initiative.\n\n\u201cThis was an especially significant day for many of our staff, as some of us are personally connected to this crisis \u2013 teachers in our school have taught girls who are now a part of the MMIWG2S crisis. It was also a healing experience for many staff and students through a drumming circle led by one of our colleagues, in which they sang the Women\u2019s Warrior Song, and Men\u2019s Warrior Song,\u201d explained Van De Keere.\n\nALSO: Red dresses honour murdered and missing Indigenous women\n\nThe walk took place over the course of a week and students were able to raise more than $500 for the Downtown Eastside Women\u2019s Centre, which provides staff support, meals, counseling, advocacy, and programs for self-identifying women who live on the Downtown Eastside.\n\nVan De Keere said the centre was a perfect place to donate the money because the centre empowers and uplifts women, girls and two-spirit individuals.\n\n\u201cNot only this, but the centre also provides very specific programming to Indigenous women through the Indigenous Women\u2019s Project,\u201d said Van De Keere.\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n\nAbout the Author: Colleen Flanagan\n\nI got my start with Black Press Media in 2003 as a photojournalist.\nRead more\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tMaple Ridge woman sentenced to probation for fatal crash\n\t\tPolice have Maple Ridge stabbing suspect in custody\n\t\tMaple Ridge Walmart closed by teen stabbing on Canada Day\n\t\tMaple Ridge doctors honoured with annual awards\n\t\tMetro Parks department brings forest bathing to Maple Ridge\nFacebook Comments (0) \nShare this content:\nBlack Press Media\nPeople Born 1944-1984 Could Get This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nRead More\nUse This and Never Have to Change Your Whipper Snipper Line Again\nUltraCut\n|\nSponsored\nWrap Foil Around Door knobs When Alone, Here's Why\nLifeHackGuru\n|\nSponsored\nCanadians Born 1944 - 1983 Could Get This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nHang A Bag Of Water With Pennies Outside Your Front Door\nLifeHackGuru\n|\nSponsored\nThe Best Comfort Push-up Bra for Elderly Women to Wear All Day.\nIt provides a perfect fit and optimal support, it doesn't slip, it doesn't leak, it doesn't bulge, it doesn't chafe,ensuring the breasts are cared for and beautifully shaped.\nSmoothl\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nYOUR VOTE MATTERS\nLooks like you have voted in all of our community polls.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-Gladys Radek MANDATORY CREDIT\nRepublished September 20, 2017 - 8:56 AM\nOriginal Publication Date September 20, 2017 - 7:56 AM\n\nVANCOUVER - When Gladys Radek walks the Highway of Tears, she says she can feel the spirits of women who are missing or have been murdered walking beside her.\n\nDozens have vanished or been killed along the notorious stretch of Highway 16 in central British Columbia. On Thursday, Radek will honour the 12th anniversary of the disappearance of her niece, Tamara Lynn Chipman, by walking the route once again.\n\n\"You can feel the pain of the families when they're walking with you,\" she said. \"It's really, really hard to describe.\"\n\nThe annual journey, made by Radek and others who have lost loved ones, will span five days this year and cover 350 kilometres between Prince Rupert and Smithers. Vehicles will accompany the walkers who will cover sections of the route in a relay fashion.\n\nCommissioners of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls are set to join the walk on Sept. 25 before community hearings are held from Sept. 26 to 28 in Smithers. This is the second set of hearings held to date by the inquiry, after it visited Whitehorse in May.\n\nSince then, the inquiry's executive director, Michele Moreau, and one of its commissioners, Marilyn Poitras, have quit and the Native Women's Association of Ontario has pulled its support. The inquiry has faced growing calls for resignations and a restart.\n\nAsked whether commissioners feel added pressure to ensure these hearings are successful, Chief Commissioner Marion Buller said they feel that obligation regardless.\n\n\"They have to be (successful), not only for our purposes, but more so for the families who come forward and share their stories with us. It's the success from their perspective that's the most important aspect for us,\" she said.\n\n\"We're always under scrutiny. Always. And we always will be,\" she added. \"I'm always open to constructive, informed criticism, as are the other commissioners. It's part of our work.\"\n\nThe federal government launched the inquiry last year to examine the systemic issues behind the high number of Indigenous women who have been killed or disappeared over the last four decades in Canada. It is expected to take two years and cost almost $54 million.\n\nBuller said the commission will ask for more money and time but it is still conducting an internal analysis before making the request.\n\nAbout 25 people, including family members and survivors of violence, are expected to testify publicly or privately at the Dze L K'Ant Friendship Centre next week. A statement-taker will be available for anyone who wishes to speak, with no pre-registration needed, said Buller.\n\nRadek will testify about Chipman, who disappeared while hitchhiking in Prince Rupert on Sept. 21, 2005. The 22-year-old was a beautiful, charming free spirit who had a young son, she recalled.\n\nCritics of the inquiry don't understand how much ground it has to cover, said Radek, who sits on its national family advisory circle.\n\n\"It's not as simple as two years of work.

Like the missing inquiry in B.C., the recommendations from the national inquiry will be non-binding.\n\nTeegee also said he\u2019s concerned that people in small communities that still lack transit won\u2019t be able to participate in the Smithers hearings.\n\nBuller said staff have visited nearby towns in recent weeks to reach out to families and it is able to help cover travel costs including mileage and meals, she said.\n\nThe hearings will be the first of nine this fall, with other stops in Winnipeg, Halifax, Edmonton, Yellowknife, Saskatoon, Sask., Maliotenam, Que., Thunder Bay, Ont., and Rankin Inlet, Nunavut.\n\n\u2014 Follow @ellekane on Twitter.\n\nSubmit a Correction\nAccessibility Feedback\nLive Radio\nConnect with CityNews\nTrending Now\nImpaired youth arrested after ATV ended up in a ditch, passenger injured\nFire at popular Halifax deli\nThe todd veinotte show july 4th 11am\nFailing to show up to court, police track man down and lay charges\nHurricane Beryl churns toward Mexico after leaving destruction in Jamaica and eastern Caribbean\nTop Stories\nImpaired youth arrested after ATV ended up in a ditch, passenger injured\n\n1h ago\n\nWentworth man wanted on two province-wide arrest warrants\n\n1h ago\n\nFire at popular Halifax deli\n\n52m ago\n\nBirch Cove and Shubie Park beaches closed to swimmers\n\n5h ago\n\nMost Watched Today\n2:32\nCanada risks \u201cmuch more censored & surveilled\u201d internet\n\nThe suite of internet regulation bills in Parliament are intended to protect people - but activists warn it could mean a much more surveilled & censored internet.

On Thursday, Radek will honour the 12th anniversary of the disappearance of her niece, Tamara Lynn Chipman, by walking the route once again.\n\n\u201cYou can feel the pain of the families when they\u2019re walking with you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really hard to describe.\u201d\n\nThe annual journey, made by Radek and others who have lost loved ones, will span five days this year and cover 350 kilometres between Prince Rupert and Smithers. Vehicles will accompany the walkers who will cover sections of the route in a relay fashion.\n\nCommissioners of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls are set to join the walk on Sept. 25 before community hearings are held from Sept. 26 to 28 in Smithers. This is the second set of hearings held to date by the inquiry, after it visited Whitehorse in May.\n\nCanucks Report\n\nEssential reading for hockey fans who eat, sleep, Canucks, repeat.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nSince then, the inquiry\u2019s executive director, Michele Moreau, and one of its commissioners, Marilyn Poitras, have quit and the Native Women\u2019s Association of Ontario has pulled its support. The inquiry has faced growing calls for resignations and a restart.\n\nAsked whether commissioners feel added pressure to ensure these hearings are successful, Chief Commissioner Marion Buller said they feel that obligation regardless.\n\n\u201cThey have to be (successful), not only for our purposes, but more so for the families who come forward and share their stories with us. It\u2019s the success from their perspective that\u2019s the most important aspect for us,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always under scrutiny. Always. And we always will be,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m always open to constructive, informed criticism, as are the other commissioners. It\u2019s part of our work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe federal government launched the inquiry last year to examine the systemic issues behind the high number of Indigenous women who have been killed or disappeared over the last four decades in Canada. It is expected to take two years and cost almost $54 million.\n\nBuller said the commission will ask for more money and time but it is still conducting an internal analysis before making the request.\n\nAbout 25 people, including family members and survivors of violence, are expected to testify publicly or privately at the Dze L K\u2019Ant Friendship Centre next week. A statement-taker will be available for anyone who wishes to speak, with no pre-registration needed, said Buller.\n\nBillboard warning girls not to hitchhike on the Highway of Tears (Highway 16) where many young women have gone missing.

And in the small community that I\u2019m from, we would never see that,\u201d said John.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard that she got murdered, and it was a horrific act of violence, it changed us forever.\u201d\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\nJohn says there are as many as 4,000 Indigenous women that have gone missing or have been murdered across Canada, including ongoing cases across the country.\n\n\u201cWe have these ladies, these sisters, in Winnipeg that were found in a landfill. And the families are the ones out there on the ground.\u201d\n\nThe latest health and medical news emailed to you every Sunday.\n\nDenise Pictou-Maloney is another advocate who knows what it\u2019s like to lose someone \u2014 her mother was murdered 47 years ago in South Dakota.\n\nView image in full screen\nDenise Pictou-Maloney is remembering her mother on Red Dress Day, who was murdered 47 years ago. She now fights for accountability and change for Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people. Megan King / Global News\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many shelters we put up, it doesn\u2019t matter how many alert systems we put out there. If we\u2019re not addressing the violence in our own back yards and the reason why our women are leaving our communities and becoming high risk, then we\u2019re always going to continue to go missing and murdered,\u201d Pictou-Maloney said.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn June of 2021, the federal government launched its national action plan to end violence against Indigenous women and girls which contained 231 calls for justice.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be quite organizationally transactional, politically based and, unfortunately, economically challenged,\u201d Pictou-Maloney says. \u201cSo that, unfortunately, impacts our women\u2019s lives because we continue to go missing and murdered, as long as we have those parameters in place.\u201d\n\nJohn continues to worry for her loved ones as the issue persists.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an auntie.

(Bailey Moreton/News Staff)\nExpand\n\nStudents from three Langford schools marched to commemorate Red Dress Day, a national day of awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people, on Friday (May 5).\n\nThey sang and banged drums as they walked along Goldstrem Avenue from Ruth King Elementary School to Savory Elementary School. Students from the two elementary schools and Spencer Middle School took part.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time that our younger kids learn more about Indigenous people and their issues,\u201d said Marlene Clifton, a Gitksan woman who works with the Sooke School District. \u201cI think by teaching them in schools, and not watering it down\u2026 (it) is a great thing. I think it\u2019s important because when I went to school, when my children went to school, there was absolutely nothing about Indigenous people. I think the time is right and that\u2019s the way Indigenous people are, everything is a time for things, a time for everything. So this is the right time.\u201d\n\nAfter arriving at Savory there was a ceremony held where elders told stories before bannock was served.\n\nJo-Ina Young, Metis elder with SD62, said she hoped by seeing diversity and inclusion taught in schools there wouldn\u2019t be a need for Red Dress marches in the future.\n\n\u201cSeeing the children come out no matter what nationality they are, they all are expressing their concern for the Indigenous women of Canada. It just raises our hearts and our emotions and our complete pride in being Indigenous people.\u201d\n\nRed Dress Day started in 2010 after artist Jaime Black\u2019s REDress project inspired the movement to pay respect to the Indigenous victims of racialized and gendered violence in Canada.\n\n\u201cWe also want to share and celebrate the strength of Indigenous women and relay how honoured women are in Indigenous culture and communities,\u201d principal of Savory Elementary School Renee Hislop said in a previous interview with Black Press Media.\n\n\u201cIt is important in our work towards truth and reconciliation, that we teach this to our young people in a way that tells the story of Indigenous peoples both past and present. It\u2019s really important to us that we share this truth in a way that honours but does not traumatize children. Our children are our future, and they are going to make the difference.\u201d\n\n- With files from Ella Matte\n\nREAD MORE: Langford students to hang red dresses to honour missing and murdered Indigenous women\n\n@moreton_bailey\n\n\nbailey.moreton@goldstreamgazette.com\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tGroup of Langford kids taking Greater Victoria music scene by storm\n\t\tVIDEO: Whales off Greater Victoria captivate shoreline photographers\n\t\tNew group aims to take a run at Sooke's traffic woes\n\t\t5 earthquakes reported off Vancouver Island: USGS\n\t\tUniversity of Victoria to shut down campus pool after a half-century\nFacebook Comments (0) \n'You shattered her life': 3 years for sexual assault of young Kelowna woman\nBlack Press Media\nMan charged in ponzi scheme identified as Okanagan drowning victim\nBlack Press Media\nPeople Born 1944-1984 Could Get This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nRead More\nScatter Soap in Your Yard, Here's Why\nLifeHackGuru\n|\nSponsored\nDiscover the Last Trimmer Head You\u2019ll Ever Need\nUltraCut\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nMan dies throwing candy during Alberta Canada Day parade\nBlack Press Media\nJuly verdict expected for Island woman accused of murdering, cutting up ex\nBlack Press Media\nAlways Keep a Bread Clip in Your Wallet, Here's Why\nLifeHackGuru\n|\nSponsored\nCanadians Born 1944 - 1983 Could Get This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nThis German Nozzle Makes the Water Pressure 15x Stronger\nPowerJet\n|\nSponsored\nFairway Market in Westshore is closing, say staff\nBlack Press Media\nHead-on crash kills 2, blocks access to BC Ferries terminal\nBlack Press Media\nYOUR VOTE MATTERS\nLooks like you have voted in all of our community polls.

The school community includes several students from Aamjiwnaang First Nation, she said.\n\nIt\u2019s the school\u2019s first time participating, said Grondin, also an Aamjiwnaang member, who spearheaded adopting the initiative at Great Lakes.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of our healing, part of our past,\u201d she said about the importance of taking part.\n\nThe empty dresses symbolize lives lost and those who are missing.\n\nThe national inquiry finished hearing testimony in October and a final report and recommendations are expected to be submitted to the federal government in April.\n\nStudents in Grondin\u2019s class, she said, helped her gather dress donations, used morning announcements to talk about Red Dress Day, and created a presentation highlighting the disproportionate number of Indigenous women and girls murdered in Canada, despite making up a small part of the overall population.\n\nStudents are getting the message, Grondin said.\n\n\u201cWe watched documentaries, (learned about) specific cases, followed it through the news, the media \u2013 it\u2019s been great,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe Lambton Kent District School Board (LKDSB), of which Great Lakes is part, announced Friday its students and staff will be marking Treaties Recognition Week Nov. 5-9, learning about treaties and treaty relationships in Canada.\n\n\u201cThe LKDSB remains committed to supporting the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada: Calls to Action as they relate to education, including furthering our understanding and education about Indigenous histories and perspectives,\u201d board director Jim Costello said, in a statement.\n\nHopes are to grow the REDress project at Great Lakes every year, Grondin said.\n\nGreat Lakes is also encouraging students and staff to wear moccasins on Rock your Mocs Day Nov. 15, she said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big push for \u2026 recognizing and spreading awareness through different initiatives through the school board,\u201d she said.\n\ntkula@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\nLATEST NATIONAL STORIES\nNEWS NEAR SARNIA\nTHIS WEEK IN FLYERS"},

When Tamara went missing, there were many others who were already missing, many others who had been murdered.\u201d\n\nDozens of women have disappeared or been killed along the highway between Prince Rupert and Prince George in central B.C.\n\nRadek and other family members and advocates left Prince Rupert on Thursday and arrived Monday in Smithers, where the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls will hold hearings starting Tuesday.\n\nThe walkers were accompanied by vehicles and have covered sections of the route in a relay fashion, allowing them to complete the walk of hundreds of kilometres over the span of a few days.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nDuring the final stretch through the town of Smithers, Radek, who is missing a leg, drove a car covered in photographs of women who have disappeared or been killed.

The hearings will be powerful, she said.\n\n\u201cI feel it since I arrived; there\u2019s a lot of emotion, lots of anxiety also or stress, because it\u2019s the first time for them,\u201d she said. \u201cJust being there beside them and listening, maybe it\u2019s helped.\u201d\n\nThe inquiry has been plagued by controversy, including the resignation of commissioner Marilyn Poitras this summer and complaints from families about poor communications and delays.\n\nBuller told a Senate committee last week that the inquiry\u2019s work has been hampered by federal bureaucracy.\n\nRhonda Lee McIsaac, who lives in Haida Gwaii and has Ojibway heritage, participated in the walk for the first time and said it was a moving experience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m walking for everybody who cannot walk,\u201d said McIsaac. \u201cI have lost a loved one. I grew up in foster care and I was adopted out. This is part of my story.\u201d\n\nMore than 40 people have signed up to speak at the Smithers hearings, which run through Thursday.

(Lisa Schick/980 CJME)\nBy Lisa Schick/CJME News\nIndigenous declaration passes, families pack gallery for Red Dress Day\nMay 5, 2022 | 4:54 PM\n\n\n\nThe gallery at the Saskatchewan Legislative Building was filled with women wearing red and ribbon skirts Thursday morning.\n\nThey were there to push the government for action on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People \u2014 and they got it, in a way.\n\nIn an emergency debate, the Assembly voted unanimously to pass and adopt the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations\u2019 Declaration to Honour Indigenous Women and Girls.\n\nAhead of the proceedings, the women and leaders gathered to share their stories.\n\n\u201cMy daughter was only 19 years old when she was taken. It took two years and 10 months for us to find her remains and we only found 42 per cent of her remains,\u201d said Gwenda Yuzicappi, her voice full of emotion.\n\nYuzicappi\u2019s daughter was Amber Redman.\n\n\u201cTwo years and 10 months not knowing where your daughter is? That\u2019s a lot of pain, that\u2019s a lot of emotions \u2014 depression, (thoughts of) suicide. I went through so many emotions, it was very, very hard (and) difficult,\u201d explained Yuzicappi.\n\nLoretta Henderson\u2019s daughter, Krista Kenny, went missing in May 2009 and was found dead a few days later.\n\n\u201cShe was kind, she was loving (and) she helped out so many people,\u201d Henderson said of her daughter. \u201cEven though it was 13 years ago, it\u2019s still so hard. Every day we talk about her (and) always mention her because she was my only daughter.\u201d\n\nJoyce Keepness is Tamara Keepness\u2019 grandmother; the five-year-old went missing without a trace in 2004.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that you never forget; it stays with you. Every day there\u2019s something that comes up that reminds you that this little person was never found. This little person, are we ever going to find her? Is she out there?\u201d Joyce Keepness said.\n\nLooking at the women around her, Keepness said she was glad to see the gathering and was proud of the leadership for putting together the show of support on Red Dress Day.\n\nFSIN Vice-Chief Aly Bear stood tall in her headdress and ribbon skirt in front of the other women, her voice full of purpose.\n\n\u201cWe have women going missing every day and it\u2019s not taken seriously,\u201d Bear said.\n\nBear said they were standing in solidarity with all the families of those missing and murdered and what they\u2019re going through. She said they were at the legislature to support and uplift the families, but also to push for the adoption of the declaration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to continue to stand up and let you know that we are still here, and we\u2019re here to continue to protect each other and we want you to stand with us as well in solidarity,\u201d said Bear.\n\nBear said the conversation needs to continue longer than just one day, that talking about the problem is the only way to find solutions to it.\n\n\u201cEvery day is Red Dress Day. We Indigenous women endure disproportionate levels of violence that are affected far too often by government\u2019s failure to act, a failure to intervene, a failure to stand up for those who need it most,\u201d said Betty Nippi-Albright, the NDP\u2019s critic for Indigenous issues.\n\nNippi-Albright said if communities keep losing Indigenous women to murder and disappearances, they\u2019re losing a very important member of society.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to Indigenous women, we don\u2019t get the attention that non-Indigenous women get when we go missing, or when we go murdered. And we need to change that and it changes by imploring our elected officials to act and stop giving lip service,\u201d said Nippi-Albright.\n\nThe declaration\n\nThe Saskatchewan Party and NDP voted in favour of adopting the FSIN\u2019s declaration, which consists of five articles.\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations and its governing and organizational structures will take responsibility and action to address the disproportionate victimization of Indigenous women and girls.\n\n\u2014 \u201cIn matters of governance and politics, Indigenous women have the right to participate at all levels of governance, including the Nation, tribal council, provincial and national levels, free from discrimination, physical, verbal, spiritual or emotional abuse and harassment, and with respect for both individual autonomy and democratic principles.\n\n\u2014 \u201cIndigenous women and girls have the right to partake in ceremonial practices, access safe and accessible childcare, education, health, recreation, resource stewardship, economic development, land protection and livelihood activities with full consideration for their important roles and responsibilities as life-givers of our Nations, free from disparagement, racism, sexual innuendo, harassment or assault; and with reasonable expectations of physical, mental, spiritual and emotional safety.\n\n\u2014 \u201cIndigenous women and girls have the right to physical, mental, emotional and spiritual protection. It is incumbent upon all persons to ensure the safety of women and girls.\n\n\u2014 \u201cIndigenous women and girls have the right to access independent and culturally relevant and safe processes to investigate and meaningfully address any and all complaints of gender-based violence. Indigenous women and girls who experience gender-based violence have the right to redress and accountability from those responsible.\u201d\n\nDuring the emergency debate, Don Morgan \u2014 the minister responsible for First Nations, Metis and Northern Affairs \u2014 said there was nothing in those five articles a person could disagree with. He talked about the government\u2019s commitment to lessening violence against everyone in the province, including Indigenous women and girls.\n\nIn her remarks during debate, Nippi-Albright talked about past action from the government on such issues.\n\n\u201cThis government has sent the message to us as Indigenous women (that) they do not care. This government does not care,\u201d said Nippi-Albright.\n\nAnd the NDP critic talked about needing the government to not just give lip service to this issue and asked whether there would be clear reporting on measurements of success.\n\n\u201cOr is it just a document you\u2019re going to say, \u2018Yeah, we approved it. We put it on the website\u2019?\u201d Nippi-Albright said as she slammed her hand down on the desk. \u201cAnd remember, not all Indigenous people have access to internet.\u201d\n\nAmong actions requested were for the government to adopt the 231 recommendations from the National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, and to offer more support to relevant community-based organizations.\n\nby Lisa Schick/CJME News\nAround the Web\nAll Canadians Aged 40-80 May Qualify for This $250,000 Tax-free Life Benefit\nDollarGuardian\nWrinkles Around the Mouth?

The First Nations clothing designer specializes in the colours black and red.\nFrank Peebles\nJun 11, 2019 9:26 PM\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nHeather Potts and the public art red dress display she has installed on her front yard at her Hart Highlands home.Brent Braaten, Photographer\n\nHeather Potts is a fibre artist who knows the power of a dress. The First Nations clothing designer specializes in the colours black and red.\n\nAfter the final report was released from the National Inquiry Into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, Potts felt moved to create. She was already well aware of the Red Dress Campaign (also known as the REDress Project), a visual touchstone across Canada that draws attention to the issue of too many female victims of violence. As someone who works with fabrics and fashions dresses, this billowed in her mind along with the personal grief she suffers.\n\nIt all blew out onto her front yard this week. Her Killarney Drive home is now a backdrop for a piece of public art, acting as a visual response.\n\n\"I have been thinking about this, turning it over in my mind, for quite some time,\" she said, and even purchased a red dress she saw one day that had the elegance she was looking for to accomplish her artistic purpose. \"It finally came to me. I put the red dress out on a stand I had for displaying clothing. I put it between two birch trees. One arm is outstretched, lifted up to the Creator. The Canadian flag is wrapped behind her because Trudeau said he would help. I'm taking him at his word. He has to respond. The Canadians have suffered, too, not just First Nations. It's mostly First Nations victims, but not all, and it affects us all. We are all together in our suffering. We must be all together in solutions. I put all this out there, then lo and behold, I looked down and saw that it was all above some lily of the valley. Jesus has sometimes been symbolized by the lily of the valley, so I took that to mean Jesus was holding all of this up.\"\n\nThe public art expression has a mental meaning to Potts as an Indigenous elder and longtime fibre artist, but it also has a direct streak of pain that comes from her heart. Her niece Amber Potts-Jaffary was last seen in 1988 after a teenaged conflict with her parents. The Etobicoke teen flagged down a stranger for a ride, following a rebellious argument and was never again seen or heard of by her loved ones.\n\nIt happened right in the midst of a serial rapist spree in that same area that turned out to be perpetrated by Paul Bernardo. Was Potts-Jaffary one of this killer's victims?\n\nOr, as in the case of the Highway of Tears experience, it is possible there were multiple predators at work.\n\n\"Both her father and her mother have passed on, now,\" said Potts. \"She has been heavy in my heart. She was so young when she went missing, and it has been more than 30 years now.\"\n\nThe empty red dress represents the missing girl who would now be a woman in Potts' life, just as the red dresses all across Canada in the national campaign represent the shocking numbers of missing and murdered women and girls, all too predominantly Indigenous.\n\nThe project began in 2014 in Winnipeg by Metis multimedia artist Jaime Black who asked for 600 red dresses be donated to her creative vision that involved them being placed in numerous public spaces around that city, and beyond.\n\n\"It is an installation art project based on an aesthetic response to this critical national issue,\" said Black, who sought to establish an unforgettable \"visual reminder of the staggering number of women who are no longer with us. Through the installation I hope to draw attention to the gendered and racialized nature of violent crimes against Aboriginal women and to evoke a presence through the marking of absence.\"\n\nIt was given nationwide life when it was taken on as an ongoing call to action by the Public Service Alliance of Canada.\n\nPotts has given it its most personal and intimate voice here in Prince George. It was coincidental, said Potts, that the Prince George Fibre Arts Guild was hosting the Association of Northwest Weavers' Guilds conference here in this city, opening on the same day as her unveiling of the red dress. Potts considered it a happy accident that underscores the power of fibre, fabric and fashion to make statements on life's most important issues and concerns.\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nReport a mistake\nThis has not been shared.

The aim of her installations was to provide,\u201ca visual reminder of the staggering number of women who are no longer with us ... and evoke a presence through the marking of absence.\u201d\n\nThe song is being released Thursday, May 5 on Fretsore Records and a portion of the proceeds will be donated to charity. Red Dress Day is observed on Thursday, May 5, in Canada.\n\n\u201cTragically, the abuse and exploitation of women remains an international problem,\u201d Henderson said.\u201c'Red Dress' extends the symbol of the red dress used in Black's work to raise awareness of murdered and missing indigenous women to raise a voice for women who have been abused, trafficked or murdered everywhere.\u201d\n\nHenderson was gigging to promote his most recent album, Where's The Revolution, released on Fretsore Records, when the label's managing director Ian Sephton heard Jack perform\u201cRed Dress\u201d in the set.\n\n\n'I was immediately moved by the melody and lyrics when I heard it. I insisted we recorded it at the earliest opportunity. It had not been recorded during the Where's The Revolution sessions, so his solo powerful live performance of the song was my first exposure to it. The audience loved it too,' Sephton said.\n\nThe initial mix, recorded at his studio in Scotland, had Henderson singing all the vocals. On reflection, he decided to ask his friend Karin Bergquist of Cincinnati band Over The Rhine to contribute backing vocals.\n\n\nBergquist's backing vocals had to be recorded remotely in the U.S. and sent to Jack due to pandemic travel bans.\n\nHenderson, best known for his years touring with Over The Rhine and Canadian outfit Cowboy Junkies, sings, plays guitars and Hammond B3 on the haunting, contemporary ballad. The recording also features Canadian Mattie Foulds (Karine Polwart, Kate Rusby), on drums and Scottish bass player Kevin McGuire (Eddi Reader, Karen Matheson).\n\n\u201cI'm only too pleased if in some small way this song helps keep the issue in the public awareness. I'm not trying to be sanctimonious and am acutely aware that violence and abuse against women is a serious cultural issue within many of our societies. A red dress has specific implications to Indigenous American cultures, but I also want to extend Jaime Black's powerful symbolism to the wider cultural issue,\u201d Henderson said.\n\nThe video for Red Dress can be viewed here: .\n\nFor more information about Jack Henderson, visit .\n\nFor more information about Fretsore Records, visit fretsorerecords.com .\n\n-30-\n\nJay Nachman\nPress Releases, Etc.\n+1 215-868-8057\nemail us here\n\nMENAFN05052022003118003196ID1104165393\n\n\n\n\nLegal Disclaimer:\nMENAFN provides the information \u201cas is\u201d without warranty of any kind.

A public dialogue was held and the report was the written representation of that discussion.\n\nIt said, \"Many of the First Nation Communities (Reserves) along Highway 16 are situated many miles from town and city centers. A majority of these First Nation communities do not have the business, recreation, or other services that are available in the towns and cities. Poverty, coupled with the need to buy essential items such as food and clothing, requires travel from these communities to the nearest town or city.\"\n\nThe report also said in another excerpt, \"The first and most significant contributing factor for many of the aboriginal women being on the highway is poverty. Young aboriginal women are placing themselves at risk by hitchhiking because they simply have no other transportation options. They have very little money, and vehicles are considered a luxury item that many families cannot afford. The percentage of families living at, or below, the poverty line in First Nations communities is disproportionately higher than any other population segment in Canadian society. Moreover, poverty in some aboriginal families is intergenerational and is persistently present through many generations of the families. Some predators know that profound poverty exists within First Nation family units.\"\n\nNoting that only the thin Greyhound bus service exists as a public transit option anywhere between Prince Rupert and Prince George, the Victim Prevention section of the report's first recommendation was \"That a shuttle bus transportation system be established between each town and city located along the entire length of Highway 16, defined as the 'The Highway of Tears.'\"\n\n\"This is an accountability piece,\" said Wild, who is using this documentary as her Masters of Journalism thesis at the University of Regina. \"It's looking at the B.C. government's inaction.\"\n\nWild is originally from Houston and is aware that a tendering process has been underway for many months to establish transportation links in these areas. No single transportation agency offered to take on the job, as far as has been publicly disclosed from this process so far. The east-west distance is more than 700 kilometres, and the north-south branches off that Highway 16 tree are legion, making transportation logistics a significant challenge.\n\nThe provincial government has publicly stated in the past that the preferred method of addressing people in poverty turning to hitchhiking as a travel alternative is by raising people out of poverty. Hence, intense focus was put on gaps in the system leading to imbalances in aboriginal education outcomes, economic enhancement projects and programs, etc.\n\nWild said these points weren't enough. \"Definitely not. That definitely doesn't change the focus at all.\"\n\nShe intends to speak with the premier on camera and felt dodged so far, since the requests for an interview were made \"months ago\" to no avail so far.\n\nThe government member with the most literal hands on the issue is MLA John Rustad, being the elected member for the largest stretch of that Highway 16 span, a lifelong resident who knows of the Highway Of Tears cases from personal memory and is also the Minister of Aboriginal Relations and Reconciliation. Wild said she felt sure she could get an interview with Rustad but said \"he's not en pointe\" for the purposes of her film and only the premier's presence would satisfy her.\n\nWhen asked if the documentary was balanced journalism, in keeping with the university degree to which it is associated, she said it was not.\n\n\"Objectivity is a requirement in journalism,\" she said, \"In documentary, there are allowances made for subjectivity.\"\n\nMany documentaries - both filmed and written - have been done on the Highway Of Tears topic. The first was directed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy (winner of two Oscars and six Emmy Awards, named by Time Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world) in 2006. The most widely viewed was directed by Matt Smiley, co-produced by Carly Pope and Prince George's Mary Teegee in 2015. It was narrated by Nathan Fillion, made its debut at the Toronto International Film Festival, and is available on Netflix.\n\n\"Oh yes, I've seen all of them,\" said Wild. She considered hers to be different. The bulk of the past work was \"documenting the history, the circumstances, but not evoking change. We are still at a stalemate on what these communities require, what these communities are asking for.\"\n\nShe and Antoneshyn both expressed gratitude and inspiration at all the support their project has received. The filming portion still needs some footage from Vancouver and Victoria, than it's into the post-production phase. Editing the raw footage into the story she wants to tell will be an onerous task, she said, but her confidence in the advocacy she is doing will be a sure guide.\n\nThe film's deadline for her thesis purposes is Aug. 15 for a complete 22-minute television-style program. After that - a process she anticipates being a year to 18 months - she will explore the possibilities of getting it into film festivals, online viewing platforms, or even expanding it to a longer form.\n\nShe especially hopes to return to the area to show the finished film in the places that helped create it.\n\n\"I want to spark more interest in this topic, help influence others to strive towards these goals,\" she said. \"I hear a lot of 'I'm just one person, what can I do?' but we want to show people that you can do something as one person. This could be my life's work. It has that potential.\"\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nReport a mistake\nThis has not been shared.

Head Start executive director Trena Larocque said the goal is to teach children how to spot danger and make safe choices.\n\n\u201cOur kids are very young, so I\u2019m hoping they don\u2019t have that issue, but we\u2019re instilling that knowledge in them right now,\u201d Larocque said. \u201cHopefully that will (continue) with them when they become teenagers and have a little bit more freedom.\u201d\n\nRed Shirt Day, also known as Red Dress Day or the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, is held annually on May 5. This year, that date falls on a Sunday, when children who are part of the program will be at home with their families.\n\nLarocque said they wanted to recognize the day on Thursday to emphasize the importance of safety.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that these children know that they need to be safe, so we decided that we would do a walk to honour and make sure they were aware of how important this day is,\u201d she explained.\n\nChildren involved in the head start program were part of march around downtown Prince Albert Thursday morning. They then took part in activities designed to teach them what to do if they feel threatened or in danger.\n\nLarocque said they hope students will learn that it\u2019s okay to ask for help when they are in trouble. Staff also emphasize the importance of knowing who to go to when they feel threatened. That list includes parents, relatives, and police officers.\n\nLarocque said knowing where your children are, especially at night, is also important for keeping them safe.\n\n\u201c(It\u2019s) being aware that when they are outside if they feel threatened and they\u2019re young, to stay close to mom and dad, to stay close to their grandparents, to their relatives, (and) that they shouldn\u2019t be wandering off too far on their own,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they do feel in danger and if they are on their own, yell and get attention from someone so hopefully they can be taken care of and be brought back home.\u201d\n\nThe Prince Albert Aboriginal Head Start Program is a non-profit preschool program that focuses on language development and cultural engagement. The program has space for 20 students at its 10th Street East location, plus another 25 spaces available as part of its home visit program.\n\nThe organization plans to host a community BBQ on Monday to give families a chance to check out the program.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to remove a sentence about families knowing where their children are that was incorrectly transcribed. The Daily Herald apologizes for the mistake.\n\n-Advertisement-\nTAGS\nIndigenousWomen\nMissingAndMurderedIndigenousWomen\nNDMMIW\nNonProfit\nPAAboriginalHeadStart\nPADailyHerald\nPrinceAlbert\nPrinceAlbertAboriginalHeadStart\nPrinceAlbertNews\nRedShirtDay\nYPA\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nCopy URL\nPrevious article\nUnexpected Kindness\nNext article\nPrince Albert Catholic Division preparing for Catholic Education Week\nJason Kerr\nhttps://paherald.sk.ca/latest-posts-jason-kerr/\nJason Kerr is the editor at the Prince Albert Daily Herald.

Commissioner Qajaq Robinson was supposed to attend the hearings but had to bow out due to a family emergency.\n\nAudette said she walked to honour the resilience and strength of the families who will be speaking for the first time to the inquiry. The hearings will be powerful, she said.\n\n\u201cI feel it since I arrived; there\u2019s a lot of emotion, lots of anxiety also or stress, because it\u2019s the first time for them,\u201d she said. \u201cJust being there beside them and listening, maybe it\u2019s helped.\u201d\n\nGladys Radek becomes emotional as she speaks after a group of family members and advocates of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls arrived in Smithers.

I grew up in foster care and I was adopted out. This is part of my story.\u201d\n\nMore than 40 people have signed up to speak at the Smithers hearings, which run through Thursday.

Participants will then march from Brunel Road to Main Street and back.\n\nCrone says the walk was named for traditional Indigenous Moccasins, and although they\u2019re the recommended footwear, showing up is more important.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had so many people come up to me to say \u2018what can I do, how can I help\u2019,\u201d says Crone. \u201cSo this is really an act of solidarity, an act toward stepping up to that line and saying \u2018I\u2019m going to support this\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe event is in honour of Red Dress Day, with Crone also encouraging participants to wear red or carry a red dress, symbolic of the missing and murdered women. \u201cWe all bleed red. On the outside, we are all different colours but on the inside, we are all the same,\u201c says Crone.\n\nAccording to Crone, Indigenous Women are 12 times more likely to go missing or be murdered, and four times more likely to be the victim of physical or sexual abuse. She notes that from 1980 to 2012, nearly 2,000 Indigenous women were murdered in Canada, with 225 of those remaining unsolved.\n\n\u201cIt seems like we\u2019re treading water because we know this isn\u2019t just historical, that this continues to happen,\u201d says Crone. \u201cWe have women and girls who have gone missing, and women who have been murdered. Their families are still mourning their deaths because their bodies are still out there somewhere.\u201d\n\nHowever, Crone says with adversity comes resilience. On May 7, Hope Arises will host a \u201cCircle of Strength\u201d ribbon skirt workshop at the Huntsville Public Library from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.\n\n\u201cIn a circle, we are all equal,\u201d says Crone. \u201cWhich means whether you\u2019re Indigenous or not, we should be inclusive, accepting, and we should stand together in moving forward.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\nFacebookTwitterReddItWhatsAppEmail\n- Advertisment -\n- Advertisment -\n- Advertisement -\nContinue Reading\nNews\nIRONMAN 70.3 Muskoka Triathlon to impact traffic and parking\nNews\nSeasonal residents donate $100,000 to Huntsville Hospital Foundation\nNews\nSurvey shows 93 new jobs created in Bracebridge in 2023\nNews\nHuntsville supports the donation of land for affordable housing project\nNews\nBracebridge rethinking its $10 million hospital redevelopment commitment\nNews\nSection of Taylor Rd. in Bracebridge set to completely close\nNews\nHospice Muskoka\u2019s Andy\u2019s House receives \u2018really important\u2019 donation from Muskoka 100 People Who Care\nNews\nHospital moving forward with \u2018detailed planning\u2019 for redevelopment proposal\nLOAD MORE\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\nIN THE NEWS\n\nIRONMAN 70.3 Muskoka Triathlon to impact traffic and parking\n \nSeasonal residents donate $100,000 to Huntsville Hospital Foundation\n \nSurvey shows 93 new jobs created in Bracebridge in 2023\n \nHuntsville supports the donation of land for affordable housing project\n \nBracebridge rethinking its $10 million hospital redevelopment commitment\nSection of Taylor Rd. in Bracebridge set to completely close\n \nHospice Muskoka\u2019s Andy\u2019s House receives \u2018really important\u2019 donation from Muskoka 100 People Who Care\n \nHospital moving forward with \u2018detailed planning\u2019 for redevelopment proposal\n \nHistoric Canso aircraft lands at Muskoka Airport\n \nMPP Smith says moving forward with current hospital redevelopment plan \u2018erodes\u2019 community trust\nMoose News with Mathew Reisler\n \nMoose Afternoons with Michelle Somerville\n \nMoose Mornings with Remy Smith Sponsored by Bracebridge Barrelhouse\n \nMoose Is Loose Lager\nNews\nWin\nEvents\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nWe\u2019re Hiring!"},

Photo by Stephen Petrick, Moose FM.\n\nMembers and supporters of Bancroft\u2019s Indigenous Community walked through the town drumming and singing Friday morning.\u00a0\n\nWhen they hit Millennium Park they gathered around the pebble mosaic for a smudging ceremony, ate strawberries for healing and held a moment of silence. After, some of the roughly 30 people shared hugs and shed tears.\u00a0\n\nIt was to mark Red Dress Day. Many Canadians now wear red and hang red dresses in public places on the day to express concern that a disproportionate number of missing persons and murder cases in Canada are linked to Indigenous women, girls and two-spirited people. \u00a0\n\nDiane Martin, of the Algonquin Inodewiziwin Centre, says public displays like this are important to raise awareness.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cWe still need to educate people that this is a crisis in Canada,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s still ongoing; there are still Indigenous women, girls and two-spirited Indigenous women that go missing on a regular basis. I think it\u2019s important that we still bring awareness and have demonstrations that are peaceful.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMartin says we can play a role in addressing the crisis, by writing letters to politicians that express our concern and holding Red Dress Day ceremonies every year, to ensure \u201cthe women are not forgotten.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n- Advertisement -\nFacebookTwitterReddItWhatsAppEmail\n- Advertisment -\n- Advertisment -\n- Advertisement -\nContinue Reading\nNews\nOpening reception for scratchboard artist Nathan Cole\u00a0\nNews\nWattle and Daub celebrates opening of new courtyard\nNews\nWork begins on Papineau Creek Bridge North of Maynooth\nNews\nPolice investigate major collision south of Tory Hill\u00a0\nNews\nCanadian Tall Boys playing at Millenium Park tonight\u00a0\nNews\nHow a peace-keeping mission 20 years ago lead to the Paudash Boat Parade\u00a0\nNews\nA second case of Mischief at Killaloe school\nNews\nMusic and more at\u00a0tonight\u2019s \u2018Strawberry Social\u2019\u00a0\u00a0\nLOAD MORE\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\nIN THE NEWS\n\nOpening reception for scratchboard artist Nathan Cole\u00a0\n \nWattle and Daub celebrates opening of new courtyard\n \nWork begins on Papineau Creek Bridge North of Maynooth\n \nPolice investigate major collision south of Tory Hill\u00a0\n \nCanadian Tall Boys playing at Millenium Park tonight\u00a0\nHow a peace-keeping mission 20 years ago lead to the Paudash Boat Parade\u00a0\n \nA second case of Mischief at Killaloe school\n \nMusic and more at\u00a0tonight\u2019s \u2018Strawberry Social\u2019\u00a0\u00a0\n \nSwim for free on opening day of the Cardiff pool\u00a0\n \nBarry\u2019s Bay and Combermere\u00a0 \u2018fitness swimming\u2019 program starts soon\nRockers, Pythons and a great big washout: The week in pics\n \nSudden drop in Negeek Lake near Combermere concerns residents\n \nCanada Day: Where to find the fun, the fireworks and the free poutine\n \nGoing wild in the last week of school\n \nNew Fire Hall celebrated in Coe Hill\u00a0this weekend\u00a0\nMiddays with Jo\u00ebl\n \nCanadian Indigenous Music\n \nNews Alerts Sign Up!\n \nMoose News with Mary Milne\n \nMoose Mornings with Sarah Kipp\n \nWeekends with Dan\nNews\nWin\nEvents\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nWe\u2019re Hiring!"},

NEW PRESS RELEASE CATEGORIES\nYour current selected language is German\nClick below to switsch to English\n \n\ufeff \n\ufeff \nMedia & Entertainment\n\nSuncor Indigenous Employees, Lana and Joy Want Everyone To Be an Ally ...\nPR-Inside.com: 2023-05-11 17:17:30\nNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / May 11, 2023 / Suncor Energy\n\nOriginally published on May 5, 2023\n\nLana Hill, who is a trusted advisor to many young Indigenous people in Fort McMurray Wood Buffalo, holds her own teenage daughter closer each time the name of another missing Indigenous person is released. Joy Flett is the knowledge keeper for her close and extended relatives, but pieces of her family tree have been stolen, and she feels a heartache that is shared by countless other Indigenous families across Canada. Both women will be wearing red on May 5.\n\n\nAlso known as Red Dress Day, May 5 marks a day to honour, remember and create awareness and action for Missing, Murdered and Exploited Indigenous Peoples (MMEIP) in Canada. The statistics are startling -Indigenous women in Canada today are seven times more likely than non-Indigenous women to be a murder victim, and three times more likely to be violently or sexually assaulted.\n\nLana, originally from Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan, and Joy, from the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation in Alberta, are part of Suncor's Indigenous and Community Relations team in Fort McMurray, Alta. They both agree that more action is needed to end the MMEIP crisis.\n\n\"Since the time of residential schools and everything leading to today, we've been stripped of our names, our languages, our hair. To be able to take back our power and voice, we need to keep speaking out against what is happening,\" says Joy. \"There are so many Indigenous people who've gone missing or have been murdered in our own city. We need to continue to say their names. They are important to somebody. We can all play a role in ending the violence.\"\n\nOne of the national organizations helping to move the needle with this progress is the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC). For almost 50 years NWAC has played a lead role in advocating for the rights of Indigenous women, girls, two-spirit, transgender and gender-diverse people, which includes critical advocacy on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG2S+) and reconciliation. The organization has been pressing the federal government to act since the National Inquiry issued the 231 Calls for Justice in 2019.\n\nWhen reflecting on Red Dress Day, NWAC urges Canadians to consider the many aspects of colonization that continue to affect Indigenous people. NWAC's Chief Executive Officer, Lynne Groulx, believes that a critical component to reconciliation is acknowledging the past.\n\n\"We invite everyone across the country to play an active role in reconciliation through education and raising awareness, as well as learning about Indigenous knowledge systems and the impacts of colonialism and racism that face many Indigenous people,\" says Lynne. \"We have taken urgent and significant action to increase awareness and address the 231 Calls for Justice and have been working hard to implement our own MMIWG2S+ Action Plan.\"\n\nNWAC's Action Plan includes 66 concrete actions they will take to help end the MMEIP. Last year NWAC reported progress on over 85 per cent of the proposed actions. This includes the Safe Passage Platform - a national reporting tool that maps cases of MMIWG2S+ and provides information on resources and services available across the country.\n\nLynne also suggests reading books, listening to podcasts or participating in educational programs created by Indigenous authors and media to see the world through their lens. She also encourages people to help amplify messages and initiatives from Indigenous voices to ensure they are being heard.\n\nOn May 5 and beyond, both Lana and Joy will be found honouring and remembering - the missing, murdered and exploited Indigenous peoples - in their own way of healing and active support.\n\n\"Through my mom's experience growing up of being called a dirty Indian, to now my 15-year-old daughter who is able to stand proud and march to the beat of her own drum, we can see there has been a lot of progress for Indigenous people to feel seen and accepted,\" says Lana. \"But we also must acknowledge the pain and trauma that is still prevalent today. We are not victims, we are survivors.\"\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Suncor Energy on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\n\nSpokesperson: Suncor Energy\n\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/suncor-energy\n\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: Suncor Energy\n\n\nPress Information\n\n\nPublished by\nACCESSWIRE News Network\n888.952.4446\ne-mail\nhttp://www.accesswire.com\n\n\n\n# 713 Words\n\nRelated Articles\n\nDisclaimer: If you have any questions regarding information in this press release please contact the company added in the press release.

Working with us ahead of time as opposed to just laying it on us a week before the day, I think would be super helpful.\"\n\nPettit has tried her best to accommodate last-minute orders, but she and other members of the Indigenous business community see the trend as a sign of how much more work corporate Canada has to do to turn support for Indigenous communities into a 365-day-a-year effort.\n\nWhile many businesses encourage staff to don orange shirts \u2014 a tradition started by residential school survivor Phyllis Webstad in 2013 \u2014 or to sell wares in the bright hue on Sept. 30, those efforts quickly fade. Companies often don't do much more to elevate Indigenous voices and causes.\n\n\"It is positive that we are seeing education happen and awareness-building happen, but it can be quite triggering and harmful for Indigenous Peoples who see it as one day of performative action and nothing throughout the rest of the year,\" said Tabatha Bull, president and chief executive of the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business.\n\nBull and Pettit say if an employer is looking to make a mark on truth and reconciliation goals, they should also be doing that work all year round.\n\nThose efforts should begin with educating staff about both long-standing and new traumas Indigenous Peoplesface and how to support those affected.\n\nPettit recallsbeing at work in 2021, when the remains of 215 children were found at a former residential school site in British Columbia.\n\n\"My boss at the time was like, 'Oh, well, everybody knew about that already' and just like kind of brushed it off, but I was feeling very emotional that day for obvious reasons, so there's tons of work that has to be done,\" she said.\n\nThat's borne out in studies too.\n\nA 2021 report from equity organization Catalyst Canada found about 52 per cent of the 86 Indigenous respondents surveyed are \u201con guard\u201d at work and about 60 per cent feel psychologically unsafe on the job.\n\nThe study was based on a survey of 820 Canadian workers from various under-represented groups, but Catalyst isolated results from Indigenous respondents for this report because their need to feel on guard was so significant.\n\nKrystal Abotossaway, president of the Indigenous Professional Association of Canada, said she has seen more companies move toward reflecting on what they can do to improve their corporate culture and support Indigenous communities in recent years.\n\nLand acknowledgments, which note which Indigenous Peoples lived and took care of a site events are being held on, are an increasingly common and good start, she said.\n\nBull counts at least 200 companies, including Bank of Montreal, Uber, Walmart and Rogers, as members of the CCAB's Progressive Aboriginal Relation program \u2014 an initiative helping them build cultural awareness and make progress on reconciliation plans.\n\nOthers have yet to take on such work. Bull thinks they're slower to act because they feel overwhelmed and afraid of having difficult conversations.\n\n\"Some corporations are just not even knowing what the right question is to ask,\" she said. \"I think we need to move beyond that, if we're going to really progress as a country.\"\n\nAbotossaway said they can start by marking other Indigenous days and use them as an opportunity to educate.\n\nAmong those she suggested are Red Dress Day, which commemorates the lives of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, and International Inuit Day, National Indigenous Peoples Day and Louis Riel Day, which celebrates the life of the late M\u00e9tis leader.\n\nThe efforts shouldn't stop there, she added. Companies should reflect on how their governance structures, hiring policies, talent pipelines and workforce education programs align with Indigenous needs, she said.\n\n\"We've seen a lot of learning and development content come out, but that's usually just one course and it might be just an hour long,\" she said.\n\n\"Is it mandatory or is it not mandatory? And then how many of your employees or workforce are participating in it?\"\n\nAbotossaway and Bull agree any corporate actions on National Day for Truth and Reconciliation or other days should involve Indigenous Peoples at every step \u2014 even if the action is selling orange apparel.\n\nBull said, \"If you're going to create an orange shirt, ensure that you're working with an Indigenous artist, ensure that the Orange Shirt Society or an Indigenous organization benefits from that and you're not making a profit off of the orange shirt or Sept. 30.\"\n\nBack to Homepage\n\nTypos\nNews Tips\nForums\n\nMUST-READ STORIES\n\nGet all the day's most vital news with our newsletter, sent every weekday.\n\n\n\nMore Business News\n\n\n\nOkanagan Companies\nCantex\t0.135\t0.01\nMetalex Ventures\t0.01\t0\nRussel Metals\t36.76\t-0.05\nDecisive Dividend Corp\t7.43\t0.18\nDiamcor Mining\t0.045\t0\nGGX Gold Corp\t0.025\t0\nCryptocurrencies\nBitcoin\t79435.7\t-3.21%\nEthereum\t4274.77\t-4.83%\nDash\t30.74\t-7.94%\nLitecoin\t91.81\t-6.56%\nRipple\t0.6053\t-4.87%\nEOS\t0.703\t-8.11%\nDogecoin\t0.1477\t-8.09%\nCardano\t0.5147\t-7.22%\nData from CryptoCompare\nRECENT STORIES\nAmbushed in failed hit job\nKamloops - 1:46 pm\nHeat warnings issued\nBC Coast - 1:43 pm\nLife in prison for murder\nAbbotsford - 1:39 pm\nA parade of aches and pains\nCalgary - 1:27 pm\nPower restored in Aberdeen\nKamloops - 1:16 pm\nMore Top Stories >\nReal Estate\nUnit #105, 2250 Majoros Road\n2 bedrooms 2 baths\n$440,000\nmore details\n\n\u00a9 2024 Castanet.net Make Castanet Your Homepage News Tips Advertising Contact Us"},

Today is also International Day of the Girl, a day to support increased awareness of global gender inequalities. On this convergence, it seems only appropriate to shine a light on Native American girls and the erasure of Native women across mainstream media.\n\nAs part of my work with Protect the Sacred, a program from Harness to educate and empower the next generation of Native American leaders, I listen carefully to the priorities of our youth. Considering a lack of protection at local, state, and federal levels, our young leaders have expressed grave concern about the safety of our Native girls. In light of the national coverage of Gabby Petito\u2019s case, more of the Native community is doubling down on demands around this concern and asking: What about us?\n\nTwo weeks after going missing while on a road trip with her fianc\u00e9, Petito was found murdered. I send my prayers and condolences to her family and loved ones; I prayed for a different outcome. While the investigation into her death continues, her case still dominates headlines. The attention and amount of coverage Petito\u2019s case has received over the last month certainly reveals racial disparities that we, as Indigenous peoples, have known and felt repeatedly for years\u2014and it continues to be heartbreaking for our community.\n\n\nXINHUA NEWS AGENCY//GETTY IMAGES\nDemonstrators gathered in Vancouver, British Columbia, to honor National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, also known as Red Dress Day, on May 5, 2021.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nIn Wyoming, the state where Petito\u2019s body was found, a Missing and Murdered Indigenous People Task Force report found that 710 Indigenous people\u2014mostly girls\u2014have gone missing since 2011. Their stories receive little to no coverage, and hardly ever lead the news cycle. When a case does get coverage, it is often filled with stereotypes and victim-blaming language. Indigenous victims and other victims of color should receive the same level of coverage and support as Gabby Petito, because all girls on this planet are daughters, granddaughters, sisters, nieces, and cousins. No family should ever have to deal with the trauma of losing their children without support.\n\nBeyond Wyoming, there is a much larger #MMIWG (Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls) and #MMIR (Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives) movement to call attention to horrific statistics that are, unfortunately, a reality for many Native communities across the country: Indigenous women and girls are ten times more likely to be killed than the national murder rate; Murder is the third leading cause of death for Native American and Alaskan Native women; Native American women under the age of 35 experience a higher murder risk than any other demographic.\n\n\nNative women and girls know these numbers like the backs of our hands. We\u2019re raised to be cautious and hyperaware. We\u2019re told stories about our mothers, aunties, and sisters who went missing and were later found murdered\u2014or who went missing and were never found at all. Even though we journey through life with acute awareness, many of us still experience situations that send our nerves into the stratosphere.\n\n\nI can\u2019t tell you how many times alarms have gone off in my head because of ignorant men whose ideas of Native women are clearly set in fantasy. In not-so-original fashion, I\u2019ve been shouted at by men who wanted me to be their Pocahontas. The ones who didn\u2019t realize I was Native and then found out I am would say things I didn\u2019t know people were even allowed to say in the 21st century. Sadly, I know I\u2019m not alone. Nearly all of the women in my family can recount similar stories of their own.\n\nEven though we journey through life with acute awareness, many of us still experience situations that send our nerves into the stratosphere.\n\nThis treatment can stem from stereotypes portrayed in pop culture and mainstream media. Often, instead of positive portrayals, Native women are hyper sexualized and victim-blamed. A prime example is Adam Sandler\u2019s The Ridiculous 6, a 2015 film that degrades Native women, starting with the female character names: Smoking Fox, Beaver Breath, and Never Wears Bra. That sort of narrative has a detrimental effect on Native girls. We become targets. In addition to high murder rates, more than one in two Native women will be raped or sexually assaulted in their lifetime, according to the Indian Law Resource Center. I\u2019m part of that statistic, and so are many women in my family. In fact, the majority of Native women I know are part of that statistic.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nOne of the solutions to protect Native girls is to always stand against this kind of representation and advocate for accurate, positive representation of Native women. Another solution is to create space for Native women to share and uplift their stories, and to amplify and support the cases of missing Native women.\n\nSARAH MORRIS//GETTY IMAGES\nActivists march for missing and murdered Indigenous women at the Los Angeles Women\u2019s March in 2019.\n\nAccording to a report by the Urban Indian Health Institute entitled \u201cMissing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls,\u201d 5,712 cases of MMIWG were reported in 2016 and only 116 of them were logged in the Department of Justice database. It is for this reason that one of Sec. Deb Haaland\u2019s first acts as Secretary of the Interior was to establish and launch the Missing and Murdered Unit to pursue justice for missing or murdered Native Americans and Alaska Natives. The Indigenous community commends Sec. Haaland for the formation of this unit to support Native women and girls who continue to be left out of conversations and decisions, and whose stories aren\u2019t uplifted by the media.\n\n\nI hope you\u2019ll join me today, on this first Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day and International Day of the Girl, in saying the names and sharing the stories of some of these Native women and girls who are either still missing or whose cases haven\u2019t been solved:\n\n\nMisty Upham: A rising Hollywood actress whose body was found in Auburn, Washington, in 2014, after she went missing while visiting her sister. The 32-year-old died of blunt-force injuries to her head and torso, according to a report. The Native community has supported Misty\u2019s family as they continue to search for answers in her untimely death.\nKaysera Stops Pretty Places: An 18-year-old who was murdered in August 2019 in Big Horn County, Montana.\n\nCecelia Barber Finona: A U.S. Army Veteran, whose body was located in Clark County, Nevada, in February 2021 after a nearly two-year search.\n\nPepita Redhair: A 27-year-old who was reported missing in March 2020. She is still missing, and her family continues to search for her. She was last seen in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\nElla Mae Begay: A 62-year-old a professional weaver who went missing from Sweetwater, Arizona, on June 15, 2021. Navajo Nation Police Department made contact with their person of interest, Preston Tolth, who was reportedly arrested on charges unrelated to Begay\u2019s disappearance. There has been no update in her case since the summer, and our Din\u00e9 (Navajo) community is seeking justice. Begay has brown eyes, weighs 110-120 pounds, and stands at just over five-feet-tall. She may be in a Silver 2005 Ford F-150 with Arizona license plate AFE7101. The Navajo Nation Police Department Shiprock District is asking anyone with information to call 505-368-1350 or 505-368-1351.\n\nTo support the ongoing search for many of our missing relatives and to help increase awareness of the #MMIWG and #MMIR movement, you can follow these accounts on Instagram: Missing & Murdered Dine\u0301 Relatives, MMIP | Who Is Missing, Missing & Murdered Native Americans, SacredMMIWG / FFADAsacr\u00e9es, Rising Hearts, and the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center.\n\nMore information on the the #MMIWG and #MMIR movement can be found on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women USA, National Indigenous Women\u2019s Resource Center, and Urban Indian Health Institute.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nNews & Politics\n\nJane\u00e9 Kassanavoid Found Her Purpose Off the Field\n\nSen.

Well over 100 attended the walk to lend support to the cause. Friendship Centre executive director Carol Hanlon read a statement before the walk. \u201cOct. 4 is a day we honour the lives of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, men, boys, and gender diverse people by showing our support for grieving families and creating a safe space to share and come together. The day reminds us all that we must continue to stand up in solidarity to prevent violence and create safer communities. Today we participate in a nationwide endeavour to raise awareness and ends this national tragedy. By having the conversations Sisters in Spirit creates, together we can make a difference by putting an end to violence against Indigenous women, girls, men, boys and gender diverse.\u201d The statistics from 2015 do not lie and tell a solemn tale. Indigenous women account for four per cent of the female population but 24 per cent of female homicides in Canada. Indigenous women report rates of violence 3.5 times per cent times higher than non-Indigenous women and girls, and incidents of violence and death from violence occurs at rates five times higher than the national average.\n\nGrandmother Lorna Grammer poses with three of her grandchildren.

We offer support to the families and communities who bear the grief of their loss and to the survivors whose lives have been forever changed.\n\nEnding this violence is a shared responsibility of all levels of government, as well as of law enforcement agencies, the justice system and civil society. Guided by the 2021 National Action Plan: Ending Violence Against Indigenous Women, Girls And 2SLGBTQQIA+ People, including the Federal Pathway,\u00a0we will continue working together with families and Survivors, as well as with Indigenous\u00a0and federal, provincial and territorial governments to protect the rights, freedoms and safety of Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people.\n\nWe are thankful for the tireless work of all the families and Survivors and the Indigenous organizations that\u00a0began to raise awareness in 2005 of this ongoing violence. The annual October 4 Sisters in Spirit vigils continue to grow across the country, bringing Canadians together to support the fight to end racially and sexually based violence.\n\nToday, join us by reflecting on the concrete actions we can take to raise awareness and end this national tragedy. Light a candle in your window this evening; talk about it with your family, friends and neighbours; and post about it on social media. Together, we can make a difference and put an end to the systemic violence against Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people.\"\n\nStay connected\n\nJoin the conversation about Indigenous Peoples in Canada:\n\nTwitter: @GCIndigenous\u00a0\nFacebook: @GCIndigenous\u00a0\nInstagram: @gcindigenous\n\nYou can subscribe to receive our news releases and speeches via RSS feeds.

Doors open at 5:30 p.m., with the show starting at 6 p.m.\n\nLeigh is an Indigenous singer-songwriter, educational consultant, and activist.\n\nWhen Leigh talks about overcoming hardships and challenges, she knows that of which she speaks.\n\nGrowing up in a remote community in Northern B.C., Leigh endured a childhood fraught with abuse.\n\n\u201cEarly on, there was domestic violence,\u201d she said. \u201cI have childhood trauma, brain injuries and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nWhen she was 14, Leigh was groomed by a family in Prince Rupert who targeted her for human trafficking.\n\nLeigh said she was on her way to Vancouver, likely to be shipped overseas, when \u201cwe were intercepted (by authorities) and I didn't actually end up being raped and trafficked. I was found in time. I wouldn't have survived.\u201d\n\nThe road they were on was B.C.'s notorious Highway 16, better known as the Highway of Tears, where many women have gone missing.\n\nThe feature movie at Tuesday's showcase is Adaawk, which shines a light on Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women along the Highway of Tears.\n\n\u201cBeing 34 now, that happened to me 20 years ago and there were girls going missing back then,\u201d Leigh says. \u201cThe family that targeted me were a Vietnamese family, and there were girls going missing all the time.\u201d\n\nLeigh will share her story to let others know they are not alone and don't have to suffer in silence.\n\nLeigh has written many songs about her challenges.\n\nLeigh says she realized \u201cwomen are scared to come forward because they don't know that they will be supported. When I was a counsellor, I was hoping that people would know that it is safe to come forward, but I needed to walk the talk. So I took a step back from counselling to immerse myself into my music.\u201d\n\nAt the showcase, she will perform several of her original songs as she spreads her message of hope.\n\n\u201cMy music is in response to wanting to create safe spaces in group environments,\u201d she says, adding music is a way to address difficult topics like abuse and addiction.\n\n\u201cJust the power of listening to others who are sharing can help to plant seeds or water an element of courage and safety rather than shame, because usually those with trauma have shame coupled in with that, and that's what makes it so hard for people to come forward.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives from various agencies that can offer support will also be at the showcase\n\n\u201cKnow if you are just starting this journey there are people out there,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are not alone.\u201d\n\nTickets are $11. Along with Leigh and the movie Adaawk, there will be guest speakers and an artisan market.\n\nSupport for this initiative has been provided by Glohaven Community Hub, Tourism Vernon and the Province of BC.\n\nBack to Homepage\n\nTypos\nNews Tips\nForums\n27\nShares\n\nMUST-READ STORIES\n\nGet all the day's most vital news with our newsletter, sent every weekday.\n\n\n\nMore Vernon News\n\n\n\nRECENT STORIES\nAmbushed in failed hit job\nKamloops - 1:46 pm\nHeat warnings issued\nBC Coast - 1:43 pm\nLife in prison for murder\nAbbotsford - 1:39 pm\nA parade of aches and pains\nCalgary - 1:27 pm\nPower restored in Aberdeen\nKamloops - 1:16 pm\nMore Top Stories >\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal Estate\nUnit #105, 2250 Majoros Road\n2 bedrooms 2 baths\n$440,000\nmore details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalmon Arm SPCA Featured Pet\n\n\nPiper\nSalmon Arm SPCA >\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBody transformation journeys\nGalleries | July 04, 2024\nVanessa Hudgens gives birth\nShowbiz | July 04, 2024\nBaseball playing pup\nMust Watch | July 04, 2024\nMischievous Beagle caught tearing up the toilet paper\nMust Watch | July 04, 2024\nVintage bathrooms\nGalleries | July 04, 2024\n\n\n\nNorth Okanagan Quick Links\nCity of Vernon\nVernon Discussion Forum\nDistrict of Coldstream\nVillage of Lumby\nCity of Armstrong\nCity of Enderby\nDistrict of Sicamous\nInterior Health\nOkanagan Regional Library\n\u00a9 2024 Castanet.net Make Castanet Your Homepage News Tips Advertising Contact Us"},

Abotossaway, president of the Indigenous Professional Association of Canada, and other Indigenous business leaders want corporate support around National Day for Truth and Reconciliation to extend all year round and transform companies, so they're more supportive of Indigenous staff every day. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Tijana Martin\nSeptember 30, 2022 - 8:32 AM\n\nTORONTO - Chelsee Pettit spent much of the summer collaborating with designers to create and manufacture apparel reflective of the Indigenous values she hoped would be on people's minds when Canada marks its second National Day for Truth and Reconciliation.\n\nBut in the days leading up to Sept. 30, she noticed many companies had not had the same forethought and were scrambling to place bulk orders with her store, Aaniin.\n\n\"It's just a little funny how last-minute other organizations that are all non-Indigenous are, and they're pushing that (work) back onto Indigenous people,\" said Pettit, an Anishinaabe woman.\n\n\"We're not like big box stores that just have disposable T-shirts and are at everybody's beck and call. Working with us ahead of time as opposed to just laying it on us a week before the day, I think would be super helpful.\"\n\nPettit has tried her best to accommodate last-minute orders, but she and other members of the Indigenous business community see the trend as a sign of how much more work corporate Canada has to do to turn support for Indigenous communities into a 365-day-a-year effort.\n\nWhile many businesses encourage staff to don orange shirts \u2014 a tradition started by residential school survivor Phyllis Webstad in 2013 \u2014 or to sell wares in the bright hue on Sept. 30, those efforts quickly fade. Companies often don't do much more to elevate Indigenous voices and causes.\n\n\"It is positive that we are seeing education happen and awareness-building happen, but it can be quite triggering and harmful for Indigenous Peoples who see it as one day of performative action and nothing throughout the rest of the year,\" said Tabatha Bull, president and chief executive of the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business (CCAB).\n\nBull and Pettit say if an employer is looking to make a mark on truth and reconciliation goals, they should also be doing that work all year round.\n\nThose efforts should begin with educating staff about both long-standing and new traumas Indigenous Peoplesface and how to support those affected.\n\nPettit recallsbeing at work in 2021, when the remains of 215 children were found at a former residential school site in British Columbia.\n\n\"My boss at the time was like, 'Oh, well, everybody knew about that already' and just like kind of brushed it off, but I was feeling very emotional that day for obvious reasons, so there's tons of work that has to be done,\" she said.\n\nThat's borne out in studies too.\n\nA 2021 report from equity organization Catalyst Canada found about 52 per cent of the 86 Indigenous respondents surveyed are \u201con guard\u201d at work and about 60 per cent feel psychologically unsafe on the job.\n\nThe study was based on a survey of 820 Canadian workers from various under-represented groups, but Catalyst isolated results from Indigenous respondents for this report because their need to feel on guard was so significant.\n\nKrystal Abotossaway, president of the Indigenous Professional Association of Canada, said she has seen more companies move toward reflecting on what they can do to improve their corporate culture and support Indigenous communities in recent years.\n\nLand acknowledgments, which note which Indigenous Peoples lived and took care of a site events are being held on, are an increasingly common and good start, she said.\n\nBull counts at least 200 companies, including Bank of Montreal, Uber, Walmart and Rogers, as members of the CCAB's Progressive Aboriginal Relation program \u2014 an initiative helping them build cultural awareness and make progress on reconciliation plans.\n\nOthers have yet to take on such work. Bull thinks they're slower to act because they feel overwhelmed and afraid of having difficult conversations.\n\n\"Some corporations are just not even knowing what the right question is to ask,\" she said. \"I think we need to move beyond that, if we're going to really progress as a country.\"\n\nAbotossaway said they can start by marking other Indigenous days and use them as an opportunity to educate.\n\nAmong those she suggested are Red Dress Day, which commemorates the lives of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, and International Inuit Day, National Indigenous Peoples Day and Louis Riel Day, which celebrates the life of the late M\u00e9tis leader.\n\nThe efforts shouldn't stop there, she added. Companies should reflect on how their governance structures, hiring policies, talent pipelines and workforce education programs align with Indigenous needs, she said.\n\n\"We've seen a lot of learning and development content come out, but that's usually just one course and it might be just an hour long,\" she said.\n\n\"Is it mandatory or is it not mandatory? And then how many of your employees or workforce are participating in it?\"\n\nAbotossaway and Bull agree any corporate actions on National Day for Truth and Reconciliation or other days should involve Indigenous Peoples at every step \u2014 even if the action is selling orange apparel.\n\nBull said, \"If you're going to create an orange shirt, ensure that you're working with an Indigenous artist, ensure that the Orange Shirt Society or an Indigenous organization benefits from that and you're not making a profit off of the orange shirt or Sept. 30.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 30, 2022.\n\nCompanies in this story: (TSX:BMO, TSX:RCI)\n\nNews from \u00a9 The Canadian Press, 2022\n\n\nMore News ...\niN RESPONSE: Readers have their say\nFollowing are emailed reader responses to stories or letters to...\nChefs mourn for Okanagan's peaches but adapt to stone fruit wipeout\nKelowna woman loses legal fight with housing co-op over medical cannabis\nFrom no strata fees to discounted golf, Okanagan developers using promos to sell homes\nPopular Kamloops News\nOkanagan contractors fined $19,000 for unsafe building sites\nJuly 02, 2024 6:00 PM\nKamloops homeless day services set to close with no promised replacement\nJuly 03, 2024 6:00 AM\nKelowna breeder wins after being sued over sick Labradoodle\nJuly 03, 2024 7:00 AM\nVernon cabinetmaker ordered to pay $2,500 for shoddy work\nJuly 01, 2024 6:00 AM\n'Merchants of death': Lengthy sentence for Vernon fentanyl dealer\nJuly 01, 2024 6:00 PM\nTop News\nKamloops police investigating targeted gangland shooting\niNwheels\nJuly 04, 2024 1:05 PM\nNo more lengthy delays in Highway 97 rock slide zone near Summerland\niNwheels\nJuly 04, 2024 11:55 AM\nHow to stay cool at work during southern Interior heat wave\nJuly 04, 2024 10:50 AM\nChefs mourn for Okanagan's peaches but adapt to stone fruit wipeout\niNwine\nJuly 04, 2024 9:41 AM\nMan broke into Kelowna construction site, climbed crane\nJuly 04, 2024 7:37 AM\nTrending Now\nTRENDING NOW: Stormtrooper party balloon chaos\nKamloops\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nKamloops Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nKelowna\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nKelowna Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nPenticton\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nPenticton Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nVernon\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nVernon Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\n\u00a9 2024 InfoTel News Ltd\nContact iNFOTEL MULTIMEDIA |\u00a0\nContact iNFOnews |\u00a0\nSubmit News Tips |\u00a0\nPrivacy Policy & Disclaimer |\u00a0\nSitemap |\u00a0\nNewsletter Signup\nView Site in: Desktop | Mobile"},

Photo by Jessica R. Durling\n\nMELFORT\u2014 Jaime Black, the creator of the red dress project, spoke about red dress displays being defaced, answering an audience question, following it happening in Nipawin.\n\n\u201cI think that when actions like that happen, we really get to see what\u2019s happening,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt sort of brings forward what\u2019s really going on underneath the surface in people\u2019s minds in our communities, and I think it\u2019s really a potential for a learning opportunity and creating a space for having conversations about why we\u2019re talking about Indigenous women and not all women. Of course all human life is valuable and important, but Indigenous women specifically are being targeted through these colonial systems in a way white women aren\u2019t. \u201d\n\nBlack visited the region during the Melfort\u2019s annual Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls conference on March 10.\n\nFirst started in 2009, the red dresses are an installation art project designed to draw attention to missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nBlack said that while the dresses are a commemoration project, they are also a call to action.\n\n\u201cThe idea of the dresses is to get people learning about what\u2019s going on if they don\u2019t know, but also to get active and change how they relate to people, and break down these barriers created by racism and colonialism.\u201d\n\nAn example of the barriers includes a low response time by the RCMP when investigating missing Indigenous women and girls.\n\n\u201cI heard from a family that they called about their missing daughter, and the police told them, \u2018they don\u2019t do family reunions\u2019 and hung up the phone on them.\u201d\n\nGlenda Yuzicappi knows this personally. Her daughter, Amber Redman went missing in 2005.\n\nYuzicappi told her daughter\u2019s story at the conference.\n\n\u201cI did face the delay with the police,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNot only the police, the media\u2026 She wasn\u2019t a priority. If it was a non-First Nations woman they would have been out there. I see it in the public\u2019s view, I see it happening.\u201d\n\nRedman went missing on a Thursday. Yuzicappi said that due to her own panic and denial she delayed contacting the police until Monday. Even then, Yuzicappi feels the police delayed the search further, not starting an active search until the family initiated one Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI phoned the police Wednesday morning and then I said \u2018we\u2019re starting a search\u2019 and that\u2019s when they came on board.\u201d\n\nYuzicappi said the issue is still continuing today. She advocates all women learn self-defensive, go in a buddy system, and let people know when they\u2019re leaving.\n\n\u201cOur women are still in danger from being taken, being abducted and I will continue to share my daughter\u2019s story. If it can help one person, then that\u2019s my purpose for today,\u201d Yuzicappi said.\n\n\u00a0\u201cAlways be observant of your area and where you\u2019re at\u2014 the parking lot, anywhere, grocery store, movie theatre\u2014 anywhere. People, men and even women can take you.\u201d\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, nine per cent of female homicide victims in 1980 were Indigenous. By 2015, Indigenous women made up 24 per cent of homicide victims in Canada. This was noted in the federal government\u2019s 2018 interim report for the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls.\n\nThe 2018 interim report shows that while homicide rates for non-Indigenous women have gone down over the decades, homicide rates for Indigenous women have been going up. Indigenous women are 12 times more likely to be murdered or missing than any other women in Canada, and 16 times more likely than Caucasian women.\n\nIn Manitoba or Saskatchewan, they are 19 more times likely than Caucasian women to be murdered or missing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on a street level, people are facing racism on a day to day basis still in our country, but it\u2019s also in the institutions,\u201d Black said.\n\n\u201cThe voices of Indigenous people are not being brought to the forefront and there\u2019s no space for Indigenous voices to be heard.\u201d\n\nBlack said often times being an ally is thought of as overcomplicated.\n\n\u201cIt can be as simple as really showing care and compassion to each other on a day to day basis and really reaching out to people when you feel like they need support. It sounds trite and sort of cute or whatever, but it\u2019s real. I think that showing care for each other is a really powerful way of fighting against these systems that are trying to tear us down.\u201d\n\nDuring the conference, Black also discussed the Wet'suwet'en First Nation in British Columbia, whose matriarchs were arrested in an RCMP raid\u2014after the women refused to leave their land for a pipeline to be built.\n\nBlack said to be an ally means being present in fighting alongside Indigenous people and protecting the land and water.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really an opportunity for non-Indigenous people to show their care for not just Indigenous culture but also the land they live on and I think we get really political with all these stuff. Yes it is political, but with me I just go back to what I stand for and what\u2019s important to me living on this land,\u201d she said\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s protecting the land and making sure it\u2019s able to provide for generations to come, and not abused through industry.\u201d\n\nBlack said it can be a scary time for Indigenous people, as the more the community stands up and speaks out the more racist backlash there is.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pushback towards us speaking out, but I think if we do that together hopefully we can remain as safe as possible as we stand up and do this work.\u201d\n\nSee a typo/mistake?\nHave a story/tip?\nGet your daily Saskatchewan news briefing\nEmail\nSign Up\nThis has not been shared.

An explanatory card is pinned to each one.\n\n\u201cI wanted it to be easy for people to know what it is about,\u201d Howell said.\n\nThe timing of the dresses\u2019 appearance is no accident, either. The installation began June 7, just four days after the federal government released the final report from its inquiry into the social, economic, cultural and historical causes of violence against Indigenous women and girls that launched in 2016.\n\nWhile one of the report\u2019s conclusions was there was no reliable way to determine how many Indigenous women have been murdered or gone missing over the years, it did say the murder rate for Indigenous women in Canada was almost six times higher from 2001 to \u201915 than it was for non-Indigenous women. The report blamed \u201cpersistent and deliberate human and Indigenous rights violations and abuses,\u201d and recommended \u201cdismantling the structure of colonialism within Canadian society.\u201d\n\nHowell said the dresses make the statistics and bureaucratic statements more real, driving the issue home to young people when they\u2019re still seeking their place in the world.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re at such a pivotal age to gain awareness and to look at the world in a different way,\u201d she said, adding she\u2019s confident at least one or two might heed the message of the dresses as a call to action to begin volunteering or even alter their career path.\n\n\u201cPeople learn quite viscerally.\u201d\n\nHowell said she hopes the dresses will remain in place through the school\u2019s summer semester, beckoning curiosity from passersby and, hopefully, sparking a dialogue, not only amongst students but across the community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s powerful.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Friday is National Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day and there are several events in the Tri-Cities, including a student festival at Rocky Point Park in Port Moody hosted by students and staff of School District 43\u2019s Aboriginal Education program. The event, which runs from 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., will also include a free drop-in lacrosse for beginners and advanced players. From 6 to 9:30 p.m., there will be a water blessing ceremony with Elder Ta7ah Amy George and Charlene Aleck from Tsleil Waututh First Nation as well as a feast at 7:30 p.m. and entertainment beginning at 8 p.m.\n\nGet your daily Coquitlam news briefing\nEmail\nSign Up\nHave a story idea?\nLetter to the editor\nReport a mistake\nMore Local News\n\tCOVID-19 taught us 'how intensely the arts\u00a0is needed': PoMoArts ED\n\tB.C. salmon are struggling.

If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email.\n\nPreviously Published at Indian Country Today.\n\nI've seen red dresses hung on trees, on campuses and elsewhere to honour murdered and missing Indigenous women. The aesthetic response is artistically stunning, but it's inanimate and pretty, and it's simultaneously disturbing when I consider the symbol isn't ascribed the value of purity or innocence. I support artistic endeavors to memorialize or create symbols, but I don't provide blind support to anything. If I'm beaten to death or go missing, don't hang a red dress for me.\n\nM\u00e9tis artist Jaime Black created the installation: \"I'm allowing people to critically think about the issue... it's amazing how... powerful it is to see these dresses just hanging there, and when you walk by them it feels like you are walking by someone but no one is in them. It really works as a kind of visceral reminder of these women.\"\n\nANDREW FRANCIS WALLACE VIA GETTY IMAGESRed dresses were seen hanging from the trees on the University of Toronto campus as part of the Red Dress Project, which brings attention to Canada's missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nThe red dress appears ghostly and impersonal, especially after it's become so familiar and synonymous -- I have come to resent when editors choose the red dress over a human face for stories about murdered and missing women, because I wonder about the danger and benefit of giving a cause to protect human life an image with no features, or life, or blood, or viscera.\n\nArt isn't enough when it's meant for an active audience.\n\nIt isn't Black's fault that there is something amiss with the way in which Indigenous women are treated in North America. It's not her fault that the tally of women missing and murdered grows as the inquiry encounters set back after set back. The work served as an aesthetic reminder that there is a blaring, unsightly, crazy-making problem and if people cannot acknowledge the inherent racism, indignity and hatred Indian women face, they will at least have to acknowledge these images: a red dress in a stagnant winter forest, or the dresses picking up a cool breeze in the spring on a peaceful day...\n\nIt's what people do with the reminder that has fallen short. It's that art isn't enough when it's meant for an active audience.\n\nArtwork like this doesn't need to be perpetuated for years without critical thought or discussion. The work is supposed to be talked about. Without that it becomes something static. The implication of a red dress signifying the absence of an Indian woman might be too much. Red doesn't symbolize promiscuity or sex work where I'm from. It's used to create positive and negative spaces, so I see the appeal in the dresses, but to majority culture the red dress doesn't signify power typically, or purity, or healing, but when have I ever cared about the average audience? Only when I'm trying to discern something's worth, or why it underwhelms me, or why I believe it might have a negative impact over its intent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt's necessary to consider these things when I know I've witnessed enough domestic violence, sexual violence and brutality to where those artistic gestures hold personal value -- this work is close to me. Someone could hang a dress for me someday, god forbid. God forbid they would choose that aesthetic response to my death.\n\nI'd prefer an effigy of my culprit to burn, hanging. I'd prefer something more than a dress, considering how rare it is I wear them. What about leggings, or a sign, \"Death to my enemies.\" I entertain these morbid things when I consider the desperation of injustice. That it doesn't come sometimes, and all I can do is wonder what will any of us do if we lose another one. Can we keep hanging red dresses? It feels like pining for justice -- it feels like laying down a rose for something unrequited, and I guess that's what symbolic gestures are, because there's absence-- something we can't exact, and we try to make something tangible to memorialize -- physicalize our grief, yearning, idea or memory.\n\nI wonder if there are enough dresses or symbols in the world to signify that pain and distress for Indigenous people.\n\nI was poolside on the Fourth of July when I received news Barbara Kentner died. The woman, my age -- a mother, too, was hit by a trailer hitch in Thunder Bay. The white man who hit her shouted, \"I got one,\" and drove away, and now she's gone. It mattered that I was enjoying my life that moment before, because I felt untouchable in some way. The news, every time another woman dies, breaks me hard.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI think about all the women who died that way, and others who worked their whole lives to the bone, and left behind debt, and deserved better; and I think about the men who died violently, too; and I think about my father, who was beaten to death, and I consider the violence he inflicted himself. I think about it all and wonder if there are enough dresses or symbols in the world to signify that pain and distress for Indigenous people.\n\nWith all the good intentions of the dress, or a tobacco tie, or any one single good thing -- I fear it pales to the willful ignorance of passersby, who won't engage -- not with a dress, or our bodies. I fear so much of our well-intended work pales, even our writing, to the men who abuse their power, or social workers who cannot be bothered to regard us, or to people who would prefer we be replaced with dresses. To what end, I think, every time I see a dress instead of the woman who should be there on that campus, or in that forest with her children, or in the breeze, anywhere but absent and unheard -- a dress.\n\nFollow HuffPost Canada Blogs on Facebook\n\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\nRELATED\nBLOGS\nINDIGENOUS RIGHTS\nINDIGENOUS WOMEN\nLIVING\nMISSING MURDERED ABORIGINAL WOMEN\nSuggest a correction\nFROM OUR PARTNER\nRecommended by\nThis HuffPost Canada page is maintained as part of an online archive.

The NWAC\u2019s CEO explains how to get it right.\n\nLynne Groulx\nSeptember 23, 2022\n\nThere is a growing interest among businesses, large and small, to add their voices to the nationwide acknowledgment of the trauma inflicted upon Indigenous children at Canada\u2019s Indian Residential Schools.\n\nThis was amplified in 2021 with the location of nearly a thousand unmarked graves at sites of the now-shuttered institutions\u2014and we know thousands more have yet to be discovered.\n\nOn National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, it\u2019s important for Indigenous people (and, frankly, for non-Indigenous people) to see businesses and brands honour those who lost their lives through the 165-year program of assimilation.\n\nIt\u2019s also important for us as Indigenous people to see them pay tribute to those who survived their years at the notorious schools.\n\nBut deploying the hashtag #TruthAndReconciliation or #EveryChildMatters can be a risky undertaking. There are many ways to make a well-meaning blunder that will prompt eye rolls throughout Indigenous Canada or, worse, to accidentally post something that\u2019s outright offensive.\n\nThat\u2019s why I wrote this blog post. I\u2019m a M\u00e9tis woman and lawyer who has been the CEO of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada (NWAC), the largest organization representing Indigenous women in Canada, since 2017.\n\nI, and other Indigenous women who follow social media, brace ourselves as September 30 rolls around, waiting for the inevitable ham-fisted attempt by non-Indigenous actors to be part of the commemoration.\n\nPlease don\u2019t misunderstand. We want you to be there with us as we grieve and as we remember and as we honour. We just want you to do so respectfully. So here are some guidelines.\n\nWhat is the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation? How is it different from Orange Shirt Day? And what should we call it on social media?\n\nThe National Day for Truth and Reconciliation was declared by the Canadian government in 2021, after the graves were found at Indian Residential Schools.\n\n(Please note: \u201cIndian Residential Schools\u201d is the official name for the schools and a construct of the colonial mindset of 19th Century Canada. In any other context, the word Indian is extremely offensive when used to refer to the Indigenous people of Turtle Island.)\n\nNational Day for Truth and Reconciliation is a day for honouring the victims and celebrating the survivors of the schools. And it\u2019s a federal statutory holiday, so it applies to all federally regulated workplaces. But it\u2019s been left to provinces and territories to choose whether it is marked within their own jurisdictions.\n\nWe note that it took Canada\u2019s federal Liberal government (which came to power in 2015 promising to act on all 94 Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission) nearly seven years to meet the relatively simple Call Number 80. It urged the creation of the holiday \u201cto ensure that public commemoration of the history and legacy of residential schools remains a vital component of the reconciliation process.\u201d\n\nThere is no doubt that the discovery of the graves\u2014which the Truth and Reconciliation report said would be found if an effort was made to look for them\u2014bolstered public support for such a day.\n\nSeptember 30 should be thought of as our Remembrance Day, and it should be referred to by its official name: the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. Any other name fails to communicate the sombreness of the occasion, just as it minimizes Remembrance Day to call it Poppy Day.\n\nSeptember 30 is also Orange Shirt Day, reminding us of the day in 1973 when six-year-old Phyllis Webstad from the Stswecem\u2019c Xgat\u2019tem First Nation arrived at the St. Joseph Mission Residential School, just outside Williams Lake, B.C.\n\nShe was wearing a vibrant orange shirt her grandmother bought her to match her excitement for her first day of school. But the shirt was immediately taken from her by school authorities and never returned\u2014an event that marked the beginning of the year of atrocities and torment she experienced at the institution.\n\nWe wear orange shirts on September 30 as a reminder of the traumas inflicted by residential schools. If you\u2019re specifically referring to Phyllis\u2019 story on social media, then it is appropriate to call it Orange Shirt Day.\n\nBut the holiday is the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, and should be referred to as such.\n\nWhat terms should you use when you refer to Indigenous people? (Terminology 101)\n\nSpeaking of terminology, when is it appropriate to refer to someone as First Nations, M\u00e9tis, or Inuit, and when is it appropriate to refer to someone as Indigenous?\n\nFirst up, here\u2019s what those different terms actually mean:\n\nFirst Nations: The largest Indigenous group in Canada, these are members of the 634 First Nations spread across the country\nM\u00e9tis: A distinct group of people who have an ancestral connection to a group of French Canadian traders and Indigenous women who settled in the Red River Valley of Manitoba and the Prairies\nInuit: The Indigenous people of the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions\nIndigenous: The First Peoples of North America whose ancestors were here before the arrival of the Europeans\n\nNext, where to use them: It\u2019s always best to be as specific as you possibly can when describing us on social media.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick reference on the best way to refer to Indigenous individuals:\n\nReference the person\u2019s specific first nation and its location\nReference the person\u2019s nation and ethno-cultural group\nReference their ethno-cultural group\nRefer to them as First Nations, M\u00e8tis, or Inuit\nRefer to the person as Indigenous\n\nSo, if someone is a Cree from the Cree First Nation of Waswanipi, say that. Second best would be to call them a Waswanipi Cree. Third best would be to call them a Cree. Fourth best would be to call them a First Nations member.\n\nAnd fifth best would be to call them Indigenous, which is a catch-all phrase that includes all First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit. But it also includes all Indigenous people around the world. The M\u0101ori of New Zealand are Indigenous.\n\nSaying someone is Indigenous is like calling a Chinese person Asian. It\u2019s true. But it misses a lot of detail.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know how best to describe someone, ask us. Preferences vary from individual to individual.\n\nBut please, despite the fact that my organization is called the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, which is a holdover from a much earlier time (NWAC was formed in 1974), please do not call Indigenous people \u2018native.\u2019\n\nWhat role should brands play on social media on September 30?\n\nAt NWAC, our hashtag for the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation is #RememberHonourAct. We think those are good guidelines for everyone\u2014individuals and businesses alike\u2014on September 30 and, indeed, year-round.\n\nRemember the survivors of the residential schools, honour them, and act to strengthen the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.\n\nIf yours is a local business, pay tribute to the Indigenous people in your area. Acknowledge their traditional territory. Recognize that your operations are taking place on the land that they have shared with you, and that you and your employees are benefitting from that.\n\nIf you are a national brand, turn the spotlight back on the First Nations communities. Highlight the achievements and the contributions that First Nations people have made to Canadian prosperity.\n\nYes, September 30 is a sombre day of remembrance. But we don\u2019t want pity. We want acknowledgments of past wrongs and promises that they will not be repeated, but we also want to embrace the promise of a better future in which Indigenous people can enjoy prosperous and happy lives free of historical trauma.\n\nAre there other notable days for brands to keep in mind for Indigenous people?\n\nYes.\n\nThere are other sombre days.\n\nLess than a week after the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, Indigenous women across Canada will gather at Sisters in Spirit Vigils to honour the women, girls, and gender-diverse people who have lost their lives in the ongoing genocide that targets us for violence. This is an annual event created to give support and comfort to the families and friends who have been left to mourn their loved ones.\n\nOn February 14, Valentine\u2019s Day, annual Women\u2019s Memorial Marches are held in cities and towns across Canada and the United States. They too are meant to honour Indigenous women and girls who have been murdered or who have gone missing.\n\nAnd on May 5, we mark Red Dress Day, a day on which red dresses are hung in windows and in public spaces around Canada, again to honour the missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nBut there are also joyous occasions.\n\nAlthough there is not a specific date set aside, summer is the time for gathering. It is powwow season. Fall is the time that we traditionally rejoice in the bounty of the hunt.\n\nOn June 21, the Summer Solstice, we celebrate National Indigenous Peoples Day. This is a day for rejoicing in our heritage, our diverse cultures, and the contributions that Indigenous people are making to the complex fabric of Canadian life.\n\nWhat social media mistakes do brands make on September 30?\n\nThe most egregious examples of brand behaviour around the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation are attempts to monetize our pain for financial gain.\n\nIf you own a clothing company, please don\u2019t print a batch of orange shirts and sell them for profit. And don\u2019t promote the sales of your shirts on social media. This happens every year and it is offensive in the extreme.\n\nOn the other hand, printing and selling orange shirts and then turning the profits over to Indigenous causes is a wonderful gesture of support.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the small brands that are doing this. Walmart, for instance, promises to donate 100% of the profits from its Every Child Matters t-shirts, which have been designed by an Indigenous artist, to the Orange Shirt Society.\n\nBe the brand that does something like that.\n\nIn all of your social media posts, be mindful that this is our history. Every Indigenous person in Canada has been touched by the residential school experience, whether or not we or our ancestors attended one of the institutions. Be mindful of the traumas that can be brought to the fore with a thoughtless twist of words.\n\nAnd again, Indigenous people are at a place where we don\u2019t need or want pity. We need people to celebrate our accomplishments. We need to feel part of a society that is eager to include us.\n\nWhat opportunities are there for intersections between Indigenous people and other social movements?\n\nIn a simple word: lots.\n\nIf there is a social justice issue being championed\u2014whether that is Pride in the gender-diverse community, or climate justice, or prisoners\u2019 rights, or racial equality\u2014you\u2019ll find Indigenous people at the forefront.\n\nMy organization is an example of that. We have whole units of staff working on all of those things.\n\nReach out to us, or other national Indigenous organizations (we list a few later on), to ask about ways you can get involved, projects you can promote, and causes you can stand behind.\n\nThis is a prime opportunity to collaborate with Indigenous creators who are passionate about the larger social issue at hand.\n\nHow can brands work with Indigenous content creators?\n\nFind them and ask them. There are plenty out there. Any search engine will quickly turn up hundreds of names of Indigenous content creators and influencers, and many will be eager to collaborate with you.\n\nHere are some examples of places to look:\n\nTikTok Accelerator for Indigenous Creators\nAPTN Profile of Indigenous Creators\nPBS Article on Indigenous Creators\nTeenVogue Roundup of Indigenous Creators\nCBC Profile on Indigenous Creators\nWhat Indigenous organizations can brands support or partner with?\n\nMost of the National Indigenous Organizations are looking for partners. We, at NWAC, have terrific partnerships with brands like Sephora, Hootsuite, and TikTok.\n\nBut there are also smaller groups out there who would be delighted to hear from you.\n\nOne example that immediately springs to mind is Project Forest in Alberta which is working in partnership with Indigenous communities to restore sacred lands so that medicinal plants and native species will thrive again in First Nations communities.\n\nThere is also a range of organizations that are working tirelessly to improve the lives of the First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit.\n\nI would point to the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, Susan Aglukark\u2019s Arctic Rose Foundation, The Martin Family Initiative, or the Indian Residential School Survivors Society.\n\nThose are just a few. And of course, there is NWAC\u2014we work tirelessly for the well-being of Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit and gender-diverse people.\n\nWhat are some examples of brands that are supporting and/or highlighting Indigenous communities the right way?\n\nMany brands are doing things right. I will again mention beauty company Sephora partnered with the NWAC to run a roundtable on Indigenous beauty to find out where they could improve. And they\u2019ve acted on their learnings.\n\nTikTok, likewise, has taken the time to reach out to us to ask for guidance on how to get engaged with Indigenous people and communities. And, over the past few years, we have worked closely with Hootsuite, providing advice and information.\n\nBut others are also making great strides.\n\nI would point to the National Hockey League which has been unreservedly vocal in denouncing the racism directed at Indigenous hockey players. The Calgary Flames opened their season with a land acknowledgement.\n\nThis would not have happened 10, or maybe even five, years ago. But society is changing, corporate behaviour is changing, the world is changing. And social media has had, and will have, much to do with that.\n\nContent creation\nBecome a better social marketer.\n\nGet expert social media advice delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nEmail address\nSign up\nBy Lynne Groulx\n\nLynne is a M\u00e9tis lawyer and Chief Executive Officer of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada (NWAC) who works 24/7 on behalf of Indigenous women in Canada.

Red Dress Day has ballooned in scale, but its message still remains as clear as it did that spring of 2010.\n\n\u201cRed Dress Day is about raising awareness and recognition of violence against women, and honouring those who didn\u2019t have a voice back then,\u201d said s\u0259lilw\u0259ta\u026c\u00a0(Tsleil-Waututh Nation) elected councillor Charlene Aleck.\n\n\u201cIt is an important day, but for First Nations communities it is especially significant because it relates to a lot of our ancestors and our relations. We are directly affected by our grandmothers and aunties being murdered, going missing, or even being mistreated,\u201d she said.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEach year rallies and marches mark the event as communities call on the government to take more action, something that has gained even further momentum since a 2019 inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women pushed for more action to end the endemic violence.\n\nThe inquiry found that Indigenous women and girls were 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than those from any other demographic, and 16 times more likely to go missing. The final, 1,200-page report included 231 actions, or \u201ccalls for justice,\u201d\u00a0that need to be taken by governments and Canadians.\n\nLocally, there are efforts being made from within First Nations communities to raise awareness on what the inquiry describes as\u00a0gender-based genocide. In previous years the Tsleil-Waututh Nation in particular has held ceremonies, marches, public events and poetry readings.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been women\u2019s groups, where women come and bring their red dress. We say our prayers and lay out mementos to give ourselves strength to move on,\u201d said Aleck.\n\n\u201cThe Red Dress movement really speaks to a lot of the work that the Tsleil-Waututh Nation does, in trying to heal the land in order to heal the people,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019re so committed as a Nation to reviving our language, continuing our ceremonies and healing the land. With that we\u2019re hoping to give our grandmother\u2019s the voice that they didn\u2019t have, to recognize the harm that was done to them and to heal.\u201d\n\nEach year the Tsleil-Waututh Nation also works in collaboration with the City of North Vancouver to bring about its Red Dress Day honouring ceremony, where the crowds gather at the Strength and Remembrance Pole in the plaza in front of North Vancouver RCMP detachment.

The event will celebrate the culture, traditions and contributions of First Nation, M\u00e9tis and Inuit people. Local schools have been invited to attend the National Aboriginal Day celebrations. The event will run at Centennial Park, located at 811 Souris Avenue in Estevan, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nThe Government of Canada has proclaimed June 21 as National Day of recognition for the Indigenous people of the country. This day also marks the summer solstice and the longest day of the year. It holds great significance to the Indigenous people of Canada and is often the day that many ceremonies and gatherings occur.\nThe Aboriginal Council is also promoting the New Dawn Sisters, a foundation that collects sanitary products for young girls who live on northern reserves who don\u2019t have access to these products, or cannot afford them. \u201cOften times, these girls are missing school because they don\u2019t have the proper products,\u201d said Gosselin. \u201cThere are many times when these girls have to make a decision of \u2018do I eat?\u2019 or purchasing these sanitary products.\u201d\nAny donations of sanitary products can be dropped off at the CUPE Local 5999 office on Third Street downtown Weyburn.\n\nSee a typo/mistake?\nHave a story/tip?\nGet your daily Saskatchewan news briefing\nEmail\nSign Up\nThis has been shared 0 times\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nMore Local News\n\tMainprize Regional Park had lots to offer on Canada Day\n\tUpdate: Severe thunderstorm warning lifted for Torquay area\n\tLongtime Weyburn golfer, volunteer named to Perry Folk Award\nAROUND SASKTODAY\nStatistics Canada says merchandise trade deficit widened to $1.9B in May\nHow to find \u2014 and use \u2014 a budgeting app that works best for you\nSaskatchewan Skies: Mars rises a little after midnight in July\nFifteen provincial parks celebrate Canada Day\nOutdoor flea market appeared like travel in time \n\nMORE AROUND SASKTODAY >\n\nYOUR VOTE MATTERS\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nAre you proud of Canada?\n Yes\n No\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nWest Central & North\nNews\nIn the Community\nBusiness\nAgriculture\nOil & Gas\nSports\nNorth Region Newspapers\nNorth Digital Editions\nEast Central\nNews\nIn the Community\nBusiness\nSports\nAgriculture\nOil & Gas\nCentral Region Newspapers\nCentral Digital Editions\nSouthwest\nNews\nBusiness\nIn the Community\nAgriculture\nSports\nSoutheast\nNews\nIn the Community\nBusiness\nAgriculture\nOil & Gas\nSports\nSouth Region Newspapers\nSouth Digital Editions\nOpinion\nSouth Opinion\nCentral Opinion\nNorth Opinion\nArts & Life\nSouth Arts\nCentral Arts\nNorth Arts\nEverybody has a story\nEvent Calendar\nThe Mix\nSouth Photos and Videos\nCentral Photos and Videos\nNorth Photos and Videos\nFeatures\nSouth Gas Prices\nCentral Gas Prices\nNorth Gas Prices\nSpotlight\nConnect\nDaily Headlines Newsletter\nAbout\nAbout SaskToday.ca\nAdvertise with Us\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of service\nPolitical Ad Registry\nVisit our network of sites:\n   \nRadio brands:\n\tEdmonton | Fort McMurray\nSaskatoon | Yorkton\n\tEdmonton | Fort McMurray\nRed Deer | Regina\n\tCalgary | Red Deer\n\tRegina\n\tRegina\n\tYorkton\n\n\u00a9 2024 SaskToday.ca"},

Contributors control their own work and posted freely to our site. If you need to flag this entry as abusive, send us an email.\n\nPreviously Published at Indian Country Today.\n\nI've seen red dresses hung on trees, on campuses and elsewhere to honour murdered and missing Indigenous women. The aesthetic response is artistically stunning, but it's inanimate and pretty, and it's simultaneously disturbing when I consider the symbol isn't ascribed the value of purity or innocence. I support artistic endeavors to memorialize or create symbols, but I don't provide blind support to anything. If I'm beaten to death or go missing, don't hang a red dress for me.\n\nM\u00e9tis artist Jaime Black created the installation: \"I'm allowing people to critically think about the issue... it's amazing how... powerful it is to see these dresses just hanging there, and when you walk by them it feels like you are walking by someone but no one is in them. It really works as a kind of visceral reminder of these women.\"\n\nANDREW FRANCIS WALLACE VIA GETTY IMAGESRed dresses were seen hanging from the trees on the University of Toronto campus as part of the Red Dress Project, which brings attention to Canada's missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nThe red dress appears ghostly and impersonal, especially after it's become so familiar and synonymous -- I have come to resent when editors choose the red dress over a human face for stories about murdered and missing women, because I wonder about the danger and benefit of giving a cause to protect human life an image with no features, or life, or blood, or viscera.\n\nArt isn't enough when it's meant for an active audience.\n\nIt isn't Black's fault that there is something amiss with the way in which Indigenous women are treated in North America. It's not her fault that the tally of women missing and murdered grows as the inquiry encounters set back after set back. The work served as an aesthetic reminder that there is a blaring, unsightly, crazy-making problem and if people cannot acknowledge the inherent racism, indignity and hatred Indian women face, they will at least have to acknowledge these images: a red dress in a stagnant winter forest, or the dresses picking up a cool breeze in the spring on a peaceful day...\n\nIt's what people do with the reminder that has fallen short. It's that art isn't enough when it's meant for an active audience.\n\nArtwork like this doesn't need to be perpetuated for years without critical thought or discussion. The work is supposed to be talked about. Without that it becomes something static. The implication of a red dress signifying the absence of an Indian woman might be too much. Red doesn't symbolize promiscuity or sex work where I'm from. It's used to create positive and negative spaces, so I see the appeal in the dresses, but to majority culture the red dress doesn't signify power typically, or purity, or healing, but when have I ever cared about the average audience? Only when I'm trying to discern something's worth, or why it underwhelms me, or why I believe it might have a negative impact over its intent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt's necessary to consider these things when I know I've witnessed enough domestic violence, sexual violence and brutality to where those artistic gestures hold personal value -- this work is close to me. Someone could hang a dress for me someday, god forbid. God forbid they would choose that aesthetic response to my death.\n\nI'd prefer an effigy of my culprit to burn, hanging. I'd prefer something more than a dress, considering how rare it is I wear them. What about leggings, or a sign, \"Death to my enemies.\" I entertain these morbid things when I consider the desperation of injustice. That it doesn't come sometimes, and all I can do is wonder what will any of us do if we lose another one. Can we keep hanging red dresses? It feels like pining for justice -- it feels like laying down a rose for something unrequited, and I guess that's what symbolic gestures are, because there's absence-- something we can't exact, and we try to make something tangible to memorialize -- physicalize our grief, yearning, idea or memory.\n\nI wonder if there are enough dresses or symbols in the world to signify that pain and distress for Indigenous people.\n\nI was poolside on the Fourth of July when I received news Barbara Kentner died. The woman, my age -- a mother, too, was hit by a trailer hitch in Thunder Bay. The white man who hit her shouted, \"I got one,\" and drove away, and now she's gone. It mattered that I was enjoying my life that moment before, because I felt untouchable in some way. The news, every time another woman dies, breaks me hard.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI think about all the women who died that way, and others who worked their whole lives to the bone, and left behind debt, and deserved better; and I think about the men who died violently, too; and I think about my father, who was beaten to death, and I consider the violence he inflicted himself. I think about it all and wonder if there are enough dresses or symbols in the world to signify that pain and distress for Indigenous people.\n\nWith all the good intentions of the dress, or a tobacco tie, or any one single good thing -- I fear it pales to the willful ignorance of passersby, who won't engage -- not with a dress, or our bodies. I fear so much of our well-intended work pales, even our writing, to the men who abuse their power, or social workers who cannot be bothered to regard us, or to people who would prefer we be replaced with dresses. To what end, I think, every time I see a dress instead of the woman who should be there on that campus, or in that forest with her children, or in the breeze, anywhere but absent and unheard -- a dress.\n\nFollow HuffPost Canada Blogs on Facebook\n\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\nRELATED\nBLOGS\nINDIGENOUS RIGHTS\nINDIGENOUS WOMEN\nLIVING\nMISSING MURDERED ABORIGINAL WOMEN\nSuggest a correction\nFROM OUR PARTNER\nRecommended by\nThis HuffPost Canada page is maintained as part of an online archive.

Four people hastily exited and began to walk briskly toward their destinations.\n\nAfter all, it was 9:38 a.m., giving them just over five hours in Smithers before the bus departed again at 3 p.m.\n\nOne of the passengers was Joe Scheck, 50, who catches the bus from Houston three times a week to do yard work in Smithers. His boss would like him to work full time, but the bus only runs on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\n\u201cIf I could, I would do it five times a week,\u201d said Scheck, standing next to his rusty Jeep bicycle, his only other form of transportation.\n\nScheck, like many residents of small communities along Highway 16 in central British Columbia, can\u2019t afford to live in Smithers but also can\u2019t find work \u2014 or even buy groceries \u2014 in his town. If he were able to work five days a week, he estimates he\u2019d take home an extra $400 a month.\n\nThe province launched the $5-a-trip bus route from Burns Lake to Smithers in June. It also started a route from Prince George to Burns Lake, which operates Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. A route that connects Smithers and nearby Moricetown has operated since January.\n\nStill, advocates say the service is only a patchwork, and it arrived more than a decade after families and Indigenous advocates called on the government to provide public transportation along a notorious stretch of Highway 16 known as the Highway of Tears.\n\nThe RCMP says 18 women have gone missing or have been murdered on the route between Prince Rupert and Prince George, but advocates argue the real number is more than 40. Many of the women disappeared while hitchhiking in remote areas with poor or no cell service.\n\nAt hearings held by the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women in Smithers last week, the lack of adequate transportation in the region came up repeatedly.\n\nGladys Radek, whose 22-year-old niece Tamara Lynn Chipman disappeared while hitchhiking in Prince Rupert in 2005, told the inquiry she knows people who have to hitchhike just to go to work. There should be a free shuttle bus service, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve even picked up a young lady, just outside of Smithers, to take her back to Moricetown because she had to go see a doctor. She was nine months pregnant,\u201d she said.\n\nThe community is also reeling from the news that Greyhound Canada has applied to provincial regulators to cancel its route from Prince George to Prince Rupert, said Radek.\n\nGreyhound said the deaths and disappearances of women in the area are tragic but that the new publicly subsidized routes have \u201cliterally put us out of business\u201d in this corridor.\n\nVIA Rail also operates a train along the route. Last August, it was widely reported the company was in talks with the B.C. government to offer $5 fares to \u201cvulnerable\u201d riders, but the idea has yet to materialize. VIA Rail said it is still discussing the matter.\n\nThe call for a shuttle bus that visits every reserve and route along the route dates back to 2006, when First Nations leaders, families and advocacy groups held a Highway of Tears Symposium that produced 33 recommendations.\n\nIn 2012, Wally Oppal completed his final report after leading a provincial inquiry into missing and murdered women. The former B.C. attorney general urged the province to immediately commit to his recommendation that it implement public transit along the highway.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until 2015 that the former Liberal government announced a $3-million plan for transportation along the Highway of Tears, including transit expansion, First Nations driver training and a community vehicle grant program.\n\nLiberal spokesman Shane Mills said the safety of women along Highway 16 was a priority for the government.\n\n\u201cImproving transportation was done in consultation with First Nations and local governments,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nThe NDP regularly criticized the government on the issue while in Opposition, but did not commit any new funds to public transit on Highway 16 in its recent fiscal update. Transportation Minister Claire Trevena couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nOppal declined to offer an opinion on the province\u2019s response to his recommendation, but he said it\u2019s clear there must be satisfactory transportation on the route that discourages hitchhiking.\n\n\u201cWe owe it to the women,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Follow @ellekane on Twitter.\n\nSubmit a Correction\nAccessibility Feedback\nLive Radio\nConnect with CityNews\nTrending Now\nNorth Vancouver family stuck in Mexico amid WestJet strike\nSurrey RCMP seeks voyeurism suspect\nKiteboarder dies in Squamish\nPolice say two shoplifters will be deported after serving time in B.C.\nVancouver police looking for 2 men after sudden death in West End\nTop Stories\nVancouver police looking for 2 men after sudden death in West End\n\nUPDATED\n\n2h ago\n\nMan sentenced to life after murdering wife in Abbotsford in 2022\n\n57m ago\n\nKiteboarder dies in Squamish\n\n1h ago\n\nECCC issues Heat Warning for eastern Vancouver Island\n\n1h ago\n\nMost Watched Today\n1:37\nVancouver's Science World dome to receive $19 million in upgrades\n\nFunding from the federal government of $19 million to retrofit an iconic Vancouver landmark, Science World, was announced Wednesday.

Students say they give the campus a haunting vibe.\n\n\u201cI was walking on campus and noticed all these red dresses. It\u2019s really eerie,\u201d one student commented.\n\nThe reaction is what artist Jamie Black was hoping for with her REDress Project. The dresses represent aboriginal women who have gone missing or have been murdered in Canada.\n\n\u201cI want people to be a little but haunted by the violence that Indigenous women are facing every day in our communities, and just the fact that they don\u2019t feel safe,\u201d said Black.\n\nAn RCMP report released in May said aboriginal women have been much more prone to violent deaths than non-native women in Canada. The last federal budget earmarked $25 million over five years to address crimes against aboriginal women and girls, and recently, calls for a public inquiry into Canada\u2019s many missing and murdered aboriginal women were renewed.\n\nUniversity staff helped bring the project to campus, noting the message hits home with at least one recent case.\n\nDaleen Bosse, an education student at the university and member of the Onion Lake First Nation, went missing in 2004. Her body was found four years later. The man accused of her murder is currently on trial.\n\nAround 130 dresses are up \u2014 all of them donated from people across the country. The project is meant to raise awareness and to motivate young people to discover more about the issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really powerful \u2014 especially the ones outside hanging from the trees,\u201d one student noted.\n\nThe dresses will be on display until Oct. 5.\n\nRELATED IMAGES\n\nArtist Jamie Black sets up a red dress inside the University of Saskatchewan's Education Building.\n\nRed dresses hang on trees on the University of Saskatchewan campus.\n\nArtist Jamie Black sets up a red dress inside the University of Saskatchewan's Education Building.\n\nRed dresses hang on trees on the University of Saskatchewan campus.\n\nSHARE:\nReddit\nReport Error\nEditorial standards and\u00a0policies\nWhy you can trust CTV\u00a0News\nWATCH MORE FROM CTV NEWS\nfalse\nMeet the first eliminated team from Amazing Race Canada\nfalse\nSask. trio head to world water ski championships\nfalse\nPM Trudeau releases Canada Day message\nfalse\nPresidential debate, SCOTUS ruling upend U.S. politics\nfalse\nPM Trudeau releases Canada Day message\nfalse\nUnknown First World War soldier honoured in N.L.\nSASKATOON TOP STORIES\nSaskatoon city councillor's leadership at private Christian school revealed in leaked document\nSask. files injunction in light of federal carbon tax dispute\nGreg Fertuck to be sentenced Thursday\nAll Co-op cardlock locations across Western Canada back online in light of cybersecurity incident\n'It was empty': Co-op stores deal with cyberattack affecting supply\nPolice seeking public help identifying suspects after Sask. man assaulted on school grounds\nMORE FROM CTV NEWS SASKATOON\nfalse\nWarnings of coyote sightings at eastside Costco\nfalse\nMore rare footage of NBA in Saskatchewan\nfalse\nThis Sask. teen taught her horse to paint\nfalse\n1930s car powers through Sask.\nfalse\nSask.woman has spent 45 years on school buses\nfalse\nFather-daughter doctor team help Sask. town\nDON'T MISS\nfalse\nPet chicken from B.C. is now a Guinness World Record holder\nfalse\nOnt. woman says black widow spider was inside bag of grapes\nfalse\nThis Calgary man is trying to climb 21 mountains in 21 days\nCTVNEWS.CA TOP STORIES\nTrying to sell or buy a home this summer?

I'm not sure if that will be where it all goes but like I say, some of the ideas that came forward were quite innovative.\"\n\nRustad, who is the provincial government's aboriginal affairs minister, attended about half of a one-day symposium held in Smithers this week where community leaders gathered to discuss options for improving transportation along Highway 16 West. The stretch has gained the moniker Highway of Tears because of the number of young women, many aboriginal, who've gone missing or were murdered while hitchhiking along the corridor. Rustad described the get-together as a \"great discussion.\"\n\nTransportation Minister Todd Stone, who did not attend the meeting, said in a press release the next step will be to \"turn the discussion into action and to work on a plan that provides an effective model for transportation as quickly as possible.\"\n\nA number of \"community-based transportation options, which could service the First Nations communities located along the Highway 16 corridor,\" were discussed according to the press release.\n\nExamples raised included the Fort St. James \"Seniors Helping Seniors,\" the First Nations community-led transportation service in Lake Babine, as well as the Northern Health Authority's Northern Health Connections bus service for out-of-town people with medical appointments.\n\nCarrier-Sekani Family Services executive director Mary Teegee, who helped give a presentation on the Highway of Tears Initiative at the gathering, was disappointed no action was taken on the work that has been done already.\n\nA shuttle service from Prince George to Prince Rupert was the top recommendation to come out of the Highway of Tears Symposium held 10 years ago and the idea was once again endorsed by Wally Oppal, the commissioner for the Missing and Murdered Women Inquiry, three years ago, Teegee noted.\n\n\"I would have liked to have seen something more concrete and some government funding and commitment tied to that,\" Teegee said.\n\nFunding for the Highway of Tears Initiative will run out at the end of December, Teegee added.\n\nAccording to a government estimate, a six-day a week service from Prince George to Prince Rupert would cost $1 million a year.\n\nNorth Coast New Democrat MLA Jennifer Rice said that's a \"drop in the bucket\" given the provincial government's annual budget is $46 billion a year.\n\n\"And considering northern British Columbia is a big part of our economy, where the resources we have here are producing so much and have historically, I think it's a small contribution that could be invested in order to help families here thrive,\" Rice said.\n\nRice suggested the event was held to divert attention away from the scandal over the \"triple-deleting\" of government emails related to the Highway of Tears but remains hopeful something productive will come out.\n\n\"I'm suspicious of the timing of the symposium, I'm thinking that it's an attempt at saving face,\" Rice said. \"If in the end that's what it takes to see concrete action, so be it...We're not holding our breath, I guess.\"\n\nIn a press release headlined \"Highway of Hope: Transportation Symposium Sets Stage for Wide-Ranging Collaboration,\" North Central Local Government Association vice president Laurey-Anne Roodenburg called the meeting a \"genesis of a new relationship, of working together in partnership.\"\n\n\"At the grassroots level, northern communities have realized for quite some time that we need to work together to solve big-ticket items,\" Roodenburg continued.\n\n\"Obviously, transportation along the Highway 16 corridor is one of those. All of us in the north, both aboriginal and non-aboriginal, need to put our heads together and come up with some practical, doable, collaborative solutions.\"\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nReport a mistake\nThis has not been shared.

Four people hastily exited and began to walk briskly toward their destinations.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nAfter all, it was 9:38 a.m., giving them just over five hours in Smithers before the bus departed again at 3 p.m.\n\nOne of the passengers was Joe Scheck, 50, who catches the bus from Houston three times a week to do yard work in Smithers. His boss would like him to work full time, but the bus only runs on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\n\u201cIf I could, I would do it five times a week,\u201d said Scheck, standing next to his rusty Jeep bicycle, his only other form of transportation.\n\nScheck, like many residents of small communities along Highway 16 in central British Columbia, can\u2019t afford to live in Smithers but also can\u2019t find work \u2014 or even buy groceries \u2014 in his town.

It also started a route from Prince George to Burns Lake, which operates Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.

PHOTO BY DARRYL DYCK /THE CANADIAN PRESS\n\nStill, advocates say the service is only a patchwork, and it arrived more than a decade after families and Indigenous advocates called on the government to provide public transportation along a notorious stretch of Highway 16 known as the Highway of Tears.\n\nThe RCMP says 18 women have gone missing or have been murdered on the route between Prince Rupert and Prince George, but advocates argue the real number is more than 40. Many of the women disappeared while hitchhiking in remote areas with poor or no cell service.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nAt hearings held by the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women in Smithers last week, the lack of adequate transportation in the region came up repeatedly.\n\nGladys Radek, whose 22-year-old niece Tamara Lynn Chipman disappeared while hitchhiking in Prince Rupert in 2005, told the inquiry she knows people who have to hitchhike just to go to work. There should be a free shuttle bus service, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve even picked up a young lady, just outside of Smithers, to take her back to Moricetown because she had to go see a doctor. She was nine months pregnant,\u201d she said.\n\nThe community is also reeling from the news that Greyhound Canada has applied to provincial regulators to cancel its route from Prince George to Prince Rupert, said Radek.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\nMegan Printz, left, wipes away tears while resting her head on her mom Lorna Brown\u2019s shoulder while listening to Chief Vivian Tom testify about her late daughter Destiny Rae Tom, who was killed in 2013.

Last August, it was widely reported the company was in talks with the B.C. government to offer $5 fares to \u201cvulnerable\u201d riders, but the idea has yet to materialize. VIA Rail said it is still discussing the matter.\n\nThe call for a shuttle bus that visits every reserve and route along the route dates back to 2006, when First Nations leaders, families and advocacy groups held a Highway of Tears Symposium that produced 33 recommendations.\n\nIn 2012, Wally Oppal completed his final report after leading a provincial inquiry into missing and murdered women. The former B.C. attorney general urged the province to immediately commit to his recommendation that it implement public transit along the highway.\n\nAdvertisement 6\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\nDennis Ross, 30, of Houston, B.C., after arriving in Smithers on a B.C.

Transportation Minister Claire Trevena couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nOppal declined to offer an opinion on the province\u2019s response to his recommendation, but he said it\u2019s clear there must be satisfactory transportation on the route that discourages hitchhiking.\n\n\u201cWe owe it to the women,\u201d he said.\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nStop scratching these, and try this instead\nDaily Pulse\n|\nSponsored\nCanucks: Nikita Zadorov\u2019s agent takes blistering shot at Vancouver reporter\nThe Province\nCanucks: After coach's criticism, the Elias Pettersson question looms large\nThe Province\nHeart Surgeon Shares 3 Min Routine For Daily Bowel Movements\nGundry MD\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nBetter than scratching, why you should try this\nDaily Pulse\n|\nSponsored\nStop Buying Lottery Tickets & Start Doing This Instead!\nYukon\n|\nSponsored\nClick Here\nRoofers Tested 17 Gutter Guards\u2026 Here\u2019s What They Discovered\nThe Actual Cost of Gutter Guards in 2024 May Surprise You\nLeafFilter Partner\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nTRENDING\nB.C.

Life Skills also did the pins (of a red dress). The large photo of the girl was done by the Indigenous Studies class. If you look up close, it is all the women in Canada who went missing that make up that picture. The (artwork) on the table was done by the English class.\u201d\n\nSchool principal Julia Corcoran was also on board, adding the project weaved its way through several different classes students are taking.\n\n\u201cThe project lends itself to lots of curricular outcomes,\u201d Corcoran said. \u201cJust being able to use art as a vehicle to share knowledge and make a change. As Rachelle said, we have a strong arts program here and a strong options program, and we do have a strong focus on Indigenous studies.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cIt was able to get a lot of kids involved, share a message and just do something that kids really could enjoy doing while learning.\u201d\n\nBell said getting teachers and students sold on the project was fairly easy.\n\n\u201cTeachers are always looking for ways to embed Indigenous culture and Indigenous ways of knowing into their classes,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSo, bringing them a project like this, where there is kind of a basis and let\u2019s see what you can do with it in your creative mind, it was great. They were able to put their own spin on it.\u201d\n\nCorcoran added plans were to have the display within the school originally.\n\n\u201cThe goal is that it would have been in our school, and people could have come in, and our kids would have been able to see it,\u201d Corcoran said. \u201cBut the fact that we are online now and we can\u2019t have the public in our building right now for extended periods of time, we did move it into an outside feature. We hope that people will take a look at the amazing work our students have done.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nWorking on the display opened up the opportunity to delve deeper into a topic that needs to come to light.\n\n\u201cIt is just starting the discussion about hard topics and being able to be comfortable having these hard conversations and being able to acknowledge that this is an issue in our country,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI think that is super important that having these conversations, even getting high school students just to discuss, is a step forward.\n\n\u201cJust being able to have a conversation about Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in a classroom is a step forward. Not everyone is going to agree, and not everyone is going to believe that this is an issue and that is okay. That is your perspective, but even just that conversation, I believe, changes a person\u2019s view on things. We are just trying to get people engaged and comfortable having hard conversations. \u201d\n\nPrincipal Corcoran believes the impact on the 100-120 students taking part will be long-term.\n\n\u201cI think every time you do a project if it opens one more person\u2019s eyes to something they didn\u2019t know about before, regardless of what project we do,\u201d Corcoran said. \u201cI am sure that there is at least one student who walked away and said, \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t know this before.\u2019 Or they had limited knowledge, and now they have a little bit more.

PHOTO BY KEVIN KING/POSTMEDIA/FILE\nArticle content\n\nManitoba\u2019s environment minister is facing scrutiny over his identification as a \u201cproud M\u00e9tis Canadian,\u201d the latest in a number of prominent Canadians who\u2019ve been accused of claiming Indigenous ancestry without sufficient evidence.\n\nKevin Klein has said he\u2019s a member of the Painted Feather Woodland M\u00e9tis, but his brother and the Manitoba M\u00e9tis Federation have questioned his claims.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cIt saddened me and it brought up a lot of emotions. It brought up a lot of history,\u201d said Klein, when reached Monday morning by National Post.\n\nKlein has been a provincial legislator since 2022, and before that he served on Winnipeg\u2019s city council. At various points in his political career, he has mentioned his Indigenous ancestry \u2014 specifically in relation to his mother, Joanne Winacott, who was murdered by her second husband in 1991.\n\nIn December 2021, Klein spoke in Winnipeg council, during a debate about the police budget. He said, \u201cI have very little to say on this one, but I want to speak from a place that no one else on council can speak from.\u201d\n\nHe went on to speak about police response times.\n\n\u201cMy Indigenous mother was murdered because the police didn\u2019t respond to the initial call. That is on record in, and it\u2019s in the court documents,\u201d Klein said at the time.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nKlein referenced his mother\u2019s identity again on May 5, 2022, in an Instagram video for Red Dress Day, also known as the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and Two-Spirit People.\n\n\u201cMy mother was murdered by her partner, and she was Indigenous,\u201d he said.\n\nI'm not self-identifying, nor am I using it, nor am I mentioning it every time I open my mouth\n\nKlein\u2019s brother, Christopher Rout, has firmly rejected the characterization that his family has Indigenous heritage.\n\n\u201cHe never grew up M\u00e9tis. My grandparents never told us we were M\u00e9tis. I never heard anything about us being M\u00e9tis,\u201d said Rout in an interview with the National Post. \u201cThe net bottom line is we are not Aboriginal at all.\u201d\n\nKlein, who\u2019s a Progressive Conservative MLA, told National Post that he first learned of his purported M\u00e9tis ancestry when speaking with his uncle Dave. They were going through old photo albums, and his uncle asked him if he had his M\u00e9tis card, Klein said.\n\nTravel Time\n\nPlan your next getaway with Travel Time, featuring travel deals, destinations and gear.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cI said \u2018No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m M\u00e9tis,'\u201d Klein recalled. \u201cHe pulled out his card and said \u2018We are. You need to get your M\u00e9tis card because your mom never had the chance to.'\u201d\n\nKlein then applied to the Painted Feather Woodland M\u00e9tis. His understanding was that they did their own research before issuing a card.\n\n\u201cIt excited me because it\u2019s a connection I never knew,\u201d he said. \u201cI went with it because of my uncle, who I loved dearly.\u201d\n\nThe uncle, said Rout, has since died.\n\nThe allegations against Klein \u2014 that his claims of Indigenous ancestry are disputed \u2014 were first reported by CBC News, which used census records to build Klein\u2019s family tree. It found no evidence of an Indigenous ancestor.\n\nKlein said what he knows of it came from his uncle, and that the Painted Feather Woodland M\u00e9tis did their own genealogical research.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cThere are many Indigenous and non-(Indigenous) who are looking for clarity on their story of origin, their family history,\u201d said Klein. \u201cAnd this is something I will continue to do as a personal journey for as long as I live.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, there have been a number of prominent Canadians who have had their claims to Indigenous identity questioned, including Ellen Turpel-Lafond, who claimed to be the first Cree judge. Her claims to be a \u201cTreaty Indian\u201d have been highly disputed.\n\nThe novelist Joseph Boyden, who\u2019s best known for writing about Indigenous culture, has long claimed Indigenous ancestry, but various news reports have since disputed his claims.\n\nIn the case of Klein, his political biographies have, at various times, identified him as M\u00e9tis, although the term has recently been dropped from some of his social media accounts, CBC reported.\n\nAdvertisement 6\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not self-identifying, nor am I using it, nor am I mentioning it every time I open my mouth. It is a family issue for me and a connection to my mother,\u201d Klein told CBC last fall.\n\nManitoba M\u00e9tis Federation President David Chartrand told CBC that Klein does not meet their criteria to identify as M\u00e9tis.\n\n\u201cWe do not recognize the Painted Feather Woodlands M\u00e9tis or any other group that claims M\u00e9tis identity outside our definition. This is no different than any of the other cases where groups or individuals are calling themselves M\u00e9tis when they really mean mixed heritage,\u201d Chartrand said in an email.\n\nOn Monday, Klein told the Post he has dropped the identifier in some places because, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to insult anybody. It really was a proud moment for me to believe that my family had that M\u00e9tis status.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 7\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a personal journey. I don\u2019t want to insult anybody, but I am going to follow my personal journey. And that\u2019s how we got here today,\u201d Klein said.\n\n\u201cI got into public life to serve, not to offend. To help people, not degrade them. It was never, has never, was never an attempt to make a false claim.\u201d\n\nKlein, who was the publisher and CEO of the Winnipeg Sun newspaper between 2007 and 2013, which is now owned by Postmedia Network Inc., speculated that a \u201cLiberal-NDP-funded government employee\u201d raised questions about his identity in order to harm his reputation ahead of the provincial election. Manitobans go to the polls in October.\n\n\u201cI can only assume it was to hurt us, to attempt to hurt us in the election when really all it did was cause more pain and sorrow for my family,\u201d Klein said.\n\nAdvertisement 8\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nKlein\u2019s official biography, from when he was appointed to Premier Heather Stefanson\u2019s cabinet, said Klein \u201ccontinues to explore, working with Elders in Manitoba to research his connections to Indigenous community. This exploration has heightened his desire to work with Indigenous communities.\u201d\n\nA profile in What\u2019s up Winnipeg, a local magazine, reports that Klein took courses in Cree and M\u00e9tis history at the University of Alberta during COVID-19 to learn more about his roots, which he\u2019d learned about from his mother\u2019s older brother.\n\n\u201cBlond and blue-eyed Indigenous people were not uncommon among certain groups in middle America,\u201d the profile says. \u201cHis family says his roots are evident in his cheekbones, which Kevin says he could never produce a proper beard!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 9\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nWhen reached by National Post on Monday, Rout also objected to Klein\u2019s use of their mother\u2019s experience with domestic violence, and said Klein wasn\u2019t even living at home when the domestic violence and murder occurred.\n\n\u201cAs a son, you shouldn\u2019t be trying to profit or benefit from your mom\u2019s death,\u201d said Rout.\n\nKlein said he hasn\u2019t spoken to his brother in more than 25 years. He does, however, have a relationship with their other brother, Duane.\n\nIn an email provided to the National Post by Klein\u2019s office, Duane purportedly writes that he can confirm that Klein and their Uncle Dave had a M\u00e9tis card \u2014 although the email does not go so far as to confirm Indigenous ancestry in the family.\n\n\u201cNo one knows the full history of my immediate family. I am not going into any detail because I strongly believe family matters are just that, between family,\u201d the email says. \u201cI pray my mom can Rest In Peace again.\u201d\n\nRECOMMENDED FROM EDITORIAL\nCanada's little-known contributions to the atomic bomb\nPierre Poilievre apologizes for calling $539K Niagara home a 'tiny little shack'\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.

Four people hastily exited and began to walk briskly toward their destinations.\n\nAfter all, it was 9:38 a.m., giving them just over five hours in Smithers before the bus departed again at 3 p.m.\n\nOne of the passengers was Joe Scheck, 50, who catches the bus from Houston three times a week to do yard work in Smithers. His boss would like him to work full time, but the bus only runs on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nTRENDING\nSask. files injunction to block feds from reclaiming missed carbon tax payments\nFlight cancelled due to the WestJet strike?

Party has turned truth telling into an election issue\nArticle content\n\n\u201cIf I could, I would do it five times a week,\u201d said Scheck, standing next to his rusty Jeep bicycle, his only other form of transportation.\n\nScheck, like many residents of small communities along Highway 16 in central British Columbia, can\u2019t afford to live in Smithers but also can\u2019t find work \u2014 or even buy groceries \u2014 in his town. If he were able to work five days a week, he estimates he\u2019d take home an extra $400 a month.\n\nThe province launched the $5-a-trip bus route from Burns Lake to Smithers in June. It also started a route from Prince George to Burns Lake, which operates Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. A route that connects Smithers and nearby Moricetown has operated since January.\n\nStill, advocates say the service is only a patchwork, and it arrived more than a decade after families and Indigenous advocates called on the government to provide public transportation along a notorious stretch of Highway 16 known as the Highway of Tears.\n\nThe RCMP says 18 women have gone missing or have been murdered on the route between Prince Rupert and Prince George, but advocates argue the real number is more than 40. Many of the women disappeared while hitchhiking in remote areas with poor or no cell service.\n\nHeadline News\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nAt hearings held by the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women in Smithers last week, the lack of adequate transportation in the region came up repeatedly.\n\nGladys Radek, whose 22-year-old niece Tamara Lynn Chipman disappeared while hitchhiking in Prince Rupert in 2005, told the inquiry she knows people who have to hitchhike just to go to work. There should be a free shuttle bus service, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve even picked up a young lady, just outside of Smithers, to take her back to Moricetown because she had to go see a doctor. She was nine months pregnant,\u201d she said.\n\nThe community is also reeling from the news that Greyhound Canada has applied to provincial regulators to cancel its route from Prince George to Prince Rupert, said Radek.\n\nGreyhound said the deaths and disappearances of women in the area are tragic but that the new publicly subsidized routes have \u201cliterally put us out of business\u201d in this corridor.\n\nVIA Rail also operates a train along the route. Last August, it was widely reported the company was in talks with the B.C. government to offer $5 fares to \u201cvulnerable\u201d riders, but the idea has yet to materialize. VIA Rail said it is still discussing the matter.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe call for a shuttle bus that visits every reserve and route along the route dates back to 2006, when First Nations leaders, families and advocacy groups held a Highway of Tears Symposium that produced 33 recommendations.\n\nIn 2012, Wally Oppal completed his final report after leading a provincial inquiry into missing and murdered women. The former B.C. attorney general urged the province to immediately commit to his recommendation that it implement public transit along the highway.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until 2015 that the former Liberal government announced a $3-million plan for transportation along the Highway of Tears, including transit expansion, First Nations driver training and a community vehicle grant program.\n\nLiberal spokesman Shane Mills said the safety of women along Highway 16 was a priority for the government.\n\n\u201cImproving transportation was done in consultation with First Nations and local governments,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nThe NDP regularly criticized the government on the issue while in Opposition, but did not commit any new funds to public transit on Highway 16 in its recent fiscal update. Transportation Minister Claire Trevena couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nOppal declined to offer an opinion on the province\u2019s response to his recommendation, but he said it\u2019s clear there must be satisfactory transportation on the route that discourages hitchhiking.\n\n\u201cWe owe it to the women,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Follow @ellekane on Twitter.\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nHeart Surgeon Shares 3 Min Routine For Daily Bowel Movements\nGundry MD\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nSask.

PHOTO BY KENT NISHIMURA /Getty Images\nArticle content\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s ill-fated 2024 presidential campaign was much criticized for being \u201ctoo online.\u201d But Democrats are no less prone to fall into that same trap. Now-Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 2020 presidential campaign, which generated considerable initial buzz before it abruptly sputtered, was infamous for listening too much to left-wing TV hosts and social media blue checkmarks \u2014 not actual Democratic primary voters. Indeed, that a loud political minority \u2014 either within a party or across the broader electorate \u2014 can drown out a less vocal political majority is now a fixture of our politics, helpfully explained by public choice theory.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nPresident Joe Biden, now seeking a second term with the worst approval ratings for an incumbent since the 1950s, is once again committing the same mistake. The doddering dolt from Delaware has been on a monthslong crusade to mollycoddle Hamas, a U.S. State Department-recognized foreign terrorist organization that slaughtered dozens of American citizens last October and still holds many hostage today in Gaza. The senile octogenarian, a mere puppet of his addlebrained ventriloquists, is now all in for Hamas.\n\nBy acceding to his young and hyper-online campaign staffers who have imbibed the woke catechism and thus view Hamas jihadists as \u201coppressed\u201d victims of Israeli \u201coppressors,\u201d the president \u2014 or \u201cDr.\u201d Jill Biden, or whoever else controls Uncle Joe \u2014 is setting himself up for failure. By making such a strong play for states like Michigan, Biden is strapping on a political suicide vest and positioning himself to be a shahid for radicals in Dearborn, Michigan, who will never be appeased and who will continue to protest \u201cgenocide Joe\u201d through election day. Meanwhile, Democrats\u2019 pampering of an Islamist death cult abroad and failure to crack down on supportive, fifth-column anarchists at home only alienate the vast majority of swing-state voters who are not virulently anti-Israel or anti-Semitic.\n\nThe Winnipeg Sun's Daily Headline News\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nBiden\u2019s initial rhetorical support for Israel in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 Hamas pogrom is now a distant memory. He has since taken countless, often unprecedented steps to throw Israel under the bus \u2014 during an hour of great wartime need, no less. Biden and his loathsome Secretary of State Antony Blinken have continuously sought to impose premature ceasefires, hamstringing the Jewish state\u2019s righteous attempt to eradicate the Hamas cancer. They have constantly threatened to withhold weapons shipments unless more \u201chumanitarian aid\u201d \u2014 inevitably gobbled up by Hamas \u2014 is delivered to Gaza. Biden has imposed sanctions on Israeli \u201csettlers\u201d in Judea and Samaria. He has even used U.S. taxpayer dollars to build an emergency pier off Gaza.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nRECOMMENDED VIDEO\n\nAnd most recently, his administration has just stood by and shrugged its collective shoulders while America\u2019s \u201cleading\u201d university campuses have been completely overrun by an infestation of riotous, anarchic Hamas sympathizers. Jewish students and faculty on campus are suffering the worst anti-Semitism in the history of the American republic, and all Biden can bring himself to do is meekly assert \u2014 as he did on Thursday \u2014 that protests must not lead to \u201cdisorder.\u201d But he has simultaneously rejected the possibility of sending in the National Guard to restore order and is openly contemplating the possibility of bringing in a new wave of Palestinian-Arab migrants.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThere is increasing evidence that the president is paying a political price for his jihad apologia. A recent CNN poll showed Trump leading Biden 49% to 43% \u2014 well outside the statistical margin of error \u2014 in a head-to-head matchup. In an incisive tweet, commentator Guy Benson took a deeper dive at the poll\u2019s crosstab data on the Israel-Hamas war: \u201cBiden is at a dreadful (28/71) on his handling of the Israel/Hamas war. Media will focus on him being deep underwater (19/81) on the issue among young voters, pushing the narrative that he\u2019s still seen as too pro-Israel. But he\u2019s relatively strong on the issue among partisan Democrats (46/53). Among Republicans and independents, who are much more pro-Israel than the Democratic base at this point, he\u2019s at (13/87) and (27/73) respectively.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 6\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nIn other words, while no one really approves of Biden\u2019s handling of the war, those outside the anti-Western/pro-jihad left-wing echo chamber are far likelier to disapprove of Biden\u2019s Hamas sycophancy. Maybe Joe can win over a few more Arab voters in Michigan or Minnesota, if he steers the course. But he definitely isn\u2019t setting himself up to win over white working-class or middle-class voters across Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona or Nevada \u2014 the vast majority of whom would prefer a clearer campaign focus on our southern border crisis and stubborn inflation metrics, and virtually none of whom prefer Hamas-style Islamofascism over Israel.\n\nBiden\u2019s political calculus, in short, is just as misguided as his moral calculus. The would-be shahid of Dearborn is in for a hard slog unless he recovers enough cognitive ability and common sense to overrule his woke staffers and change course immediately.\n\n\u2014 Josh Hammer is an American conservative political commentator, attorney, columnist and host of The Josh Hammer Show.\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nStop Buying Lottery Tickets & Start Doing This Instead!\nYukon\n|\nSponsored\nClick Here\nCops hunt for suspect after child sexually assaulted\nWinnipeg Sun\nManitoba RCMP shoot and kill man who was allegedly assaulting a woman\nWinnipeg Sun\nCasinos Hate You Doing This.

PHOTO BY STRINGER /AFP via Getty Images\nArticle content\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Hamas announced its acceptance Monday of an Egyptian-Qatari cease-fire proposal, but Israel said the deal did not meet its \u201ccore demands\u201d and that it was pushing ahead with an assault on the southern Gaza town of Rafah. Still, Israel said it would continue negotiations.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe high-stakes diplomatic moves and military brinkmanship left a glimmer of hope alive \u2014 but only barely \u2014 for an accord that could bring at least a pause in the 7-month-old war that has devastated the Gaza Strip. Hanging over the wrangling was the threat of an all-out Israeli assault on Rafah, a move the United States strongly opposes and that aid groups warn will be disastrous for some 1.4 million Palestinians taking refuge there.\n\nHamas\u2019s abrupt acceptance of the cease-fire deal came hours after Israel ordered an evacuation of some 100,000 Palestinians from eastern neighborhoods of Rafah, signaling an invasion was imminent.\n\nIsrael\u2019s War Cabinet decided to continue the Rafah operation, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said. At the same time, it said that while the proposal Hamas agreed to \u201cis far from meeting Israel\u2019s core demands,\u201d it would send negotiators to Egypt to work on a deal.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe Israeli military said it was conducting \u201ctargeted strikes\u201d against Hamas in eastern Rafah. The nature of the strikes was not immediately known, but the move appeared aimed at keeping the pressure on as talks continue.\n\nPresident Joe Biden spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and reiterated U.S. concerns about an invasion of Rafah. U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said American officials were reviewing the Hamas response \u201cand discussing it with our partners in the region.\u201d An American official said the U.S. was examining whether what Hamas agreed to was the version signed off to by Israel and international negotiators or something else.\n\nIt was not immediately known if the proposal Hamas agreed to was substantially different from one that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken pressed the militant group to accept last week, which Blinken said included significant Israeli concessions.\n\nThe Winnipeg Sun's Daily Headline News\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nEgyptian officials said that proposal called for a cease-fire of multiple stages starting with a limited hostage release and partial Israeli troop pullbacks within Gaza. The two sides would also negotiate a \u201cpermanent calm\u201d that would lead to a full hostage release and greater Israeli withdrawal out of the territory, they said.\n\nHamas sought clearer guarantees for its key demand of an end to the war and complete Israeli withdrawal in return for the release of all hostages, but it wasn\u2019t clear if any changes were made.\n\nIsraeli leaders have repeatedly rejected that trade-off, vowing to keep up their campaign until Hamas is destroyed after its Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war.\n\nNetanyahu is under pressure from hard-line partners in his coalition who demand an attack on Rafah and could collapse his government if he signs onto a deal. But he also faces pressure from the families of hostages to reach a deal for their release.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThousands of Israelis rallied around the country Monday night calling for an immediate agreement. About a thousand protesters swelled near the defense headquarters in Tel Aviv, where police tried to clear the road. In Jerusalem, about a hundred protesters marched toward Netanyahu\u2019s residence with a banner reading, \u201cThe blood is on your hands.\u201c\n\nIsrael says Rafah is the last significant Hamas stronghold in Gaza, and Netanyahu said Monday that the offensive against the town was vital to ensuring the militants can\u2019t rebuild their military capabilities.\n\nBut he faces strong American opposition. Miller said Monday the U.S. has not seen a credible and implementable plan to protect Palestinian civilians. \u201cWe cannot support an operation in Rafah as it is currently envisioned,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement 6\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe looming operation has raised global alarm. Aid agencies have warned that an offensive will bring a surge of more civilian deaths in an Israeli campaign that has already killed 34,000 people and devastated the territory. It could also wreck the humanitarian aid operation based out of Rafah that is keeping Palestinians across the Gaza Strip alive, they say.\n\nU.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk on Monday called the evacuation order \u201cinhumane.\u201d\n\n\u201cGazans continue to be hit with bombs, disease, and even famine. And today, they have been told that they must relocate yet again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will only expose them to more danger and misery.\u201d\n\nIsraeli leaflets, text messages and radio broadcasts ordered Palestinians to evacuate eastern neighborhoods of Rafah, warning that an attack was imminent and anyone who stays \u201cputs themselves and their family members in danger.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 7\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe military told people to move to an Israel-declared humanitarian zone called Muwasi, a makeshift camp on the coast. It said Israel has expanded the size of the zone and that it included tents, food, water and field hospitals.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear, however, if that was already in place.\n\nAround 450,000 displaced Palestinians already are sheltering in Muwasi. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said it has been providing them with aid. But conditions are squalid, with few sanitation facilities in the largely rural area, forcing families to dig private latrines.\n\nJan Egeland, secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, condemned the \u201cforced, unlawful\u201d evacuation order to Muwasi.\n\nAdvertisement 8\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cThe area is already overstretched and devoid of vital services,\u201d Egeland said.\n\nThe evacuation order left Palestinians in Rafah wrestling with having to uproot their families once again for an unknown fate, exhausted after months living in sprawling tent camps or crammed into schools or other shelters in and around the city. Israeli airstrikes on Rafah early Monday killed 22 people, including children and two infants.\n\nMohammed Jindiyah said that at the beginning of the war, he tried to hold out in his home in northern Gaza under heavy bombardment before fleeing to Rafah.\n\nHe is complying with Israel\u2019s evacuation order this time, but was unsure whether to move to Muwasi or elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWe are 12 families, and we don\u2019t know where to go. There is no safe area in Gaza,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement 9\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nSahar Abu Nahel, who fled to Rafah with 20 family members, including her children and grandchildren, wiped tears from her cheeks, despairing at a new move.\n\n\u201cI have no money or anything. I am seriously tired, as are the children,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s more honorable for us to die. We are being humiliated.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s bombardment and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 34,700 Palestinians, around two-thirds of them children and women, according to Gaza health officials. The tally doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants. More than 80% of the population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, and hundreds of thousands in the north are on the brink of famine, according to the U.N.\n\nThe war was sparked by the unprecedented Oct. 7 raid into southern Israel in which Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted some 250 hostages. After exchanges during a November cease-fire, Hamas is believed to still hold about 100 Israelis as well the bodies of around 30 others.\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nStop Buying Lottery Tickets & Start Doing This Instead!\nYukon\n|\nSponsored\nClick Here\nCops hunt for suspect after child sexually assaulted\nWinnipeg Sun\nChristopher Reeve's son will make a cameo in James Gunn's 'Superman'\nWinnipeg Sun\nCasinos Hate You Doing This.

{"url": "https://www.judicialwatch.org/bulletins/highway-of-tears-the-murders-in-indian-country/", "title": "Highway of Tears (The Murders in Indian Country) | Judicial Watch", "body": "Skip to content\nDONATE\nShare\nINVESTIGATIVE BULLETIN\n|\nFEBRUARY 27, 2019\nHighway of Tears (The Murders in Indian Country)\n\nIn January, Judicial Watch published a short report, \u201cThe Murders in Indian Country,\u201d outlining the shocking rate of murders and assaults inflicted on Native American and Alaska Native women. While accurate information is scarce, surveys suggest that the women are murdered at a rate ten times the national average. The response to the Judicial Watch report was tremendous. The story bounced around social media for weeks and prompted a stream of emails.\n\nWe noted that Congress had dropped the ball last year, allowing \u201cSavanna\u2019s Act\u201d to die in the House of Representatives. The bill had strong bipartisan support and would have forged new ties between law-enforcement agencies and improved data collection related to crimes against Native Americans and Alaska Natives. The bill was named for 22-year-old Savanna LaFontaine-Graywind, brutally murdered in North Dakota in 2017.\n\nNow, Savanna\u2019s Act is back, reintroduced in the Senate by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada. There is an \u201cepidemic of murdered and missing Native women and girls,\u201d the senators said in a joint press release.\n\nSpecifically, they noted, Savanna\u2019s Act \u201caims to bridge the gap of the limited data on the number of missing Native women by directing the U.S. Department of Justice to formulate new guidelines for the reporting of violent crimes against indigenous people. The bill improves tribal access to certain federal crime information databases by mandating that the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Interior consult with Indian tribes on how to further improve these databases and access to them. It also requires certain federal agencies to solicit recommendations from tribes on enhancing the safety of Native women.\u201d\n\nThe bill mandates \u201cthe creation of standardized guidelines for responding to cases of missing and murdered Native Americans, in consultations with tribes, which will include guidance on inter-jurisdictional cooperation among tribes and federal, state, and local law enforcement.\u201d It requires \u201cstatistics on missing and murdered Native women, and recommendations on how to improve data collection, to be included in an annual report to Congress.\u201d\n\nMany of the responses to the Judicial Watch story came from Canada. \u201cMy daughter is Ojibway and I am scared to death for her safety,\u201d a reader wrote. \u201cTeenage girls are most likely to go missing. The public must know the facts on the staggering number of missing or dead Native youth.\u201d This mother urged us to \u201clook into the numbers in Canada, especially out west.\u201d\n\nCanada? That was news to us. So we took a look. Our readers in Canada were right. It\u2019s a disgrace and a scandal.\n\nMany killings and disappearances in Canada center around Highway 16, the so-called \u201cHighway of Tears,\u201d a 450-mile stretch of desolate roadway in British Columbia. \u201cDozens of Canadian women and girls, most of them indigenous, have disappeared or been murdered near Highway 16,\u201d reports the New York Times, \u201ca remote ribbon of asphalt that bisects British Columbia and snakes past thick forests, logging towns and impoverished Indian reserves on its way to the Pacific Ocean.\u201d\n\nAs in the U.S., there is no clear accounting of the missing and dead. A special unit of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police connected 18 cases to the Highway of Tears, the Times reported. But community activists \u201cbelieve the total is closer to 50.\u201d A detailed chart posted on Wikipedia puts the count at over 70. The numbers controversy extends to the entire country, where estimates of missing and dead women of indigenous descent range from 1,200 to more than 4,000.\n\nThe Highway of Tears is a symbol of the evil fortune fallen to indigenous women in North America in the 21st century. It also has become \u201ca political scandal in British Columbia,\u201d the Times noted. A national inquiry was launched in 2017, but it appears to be going nowhere. Meanwhile, the disappearances and deaths continue. In August, 18-year-old Jessica Patrick went missing in Smithers, British Columbia\u2014a bucolic mountain town along the Highway of Tears. In September, her body was found in the forest. Exactly a year earlier, the national inquiry commission had been in Smithers for three days of hearings, seeking answers and hearing pain.\n\n***\n\nMicah Morrison is chief investigative reporter for Judicial Watch.

Consisting of 60 red dresses elegantly suspended from trees, this powerful exhibit symbolized the missing or murdered Indigenous individuals from Ketchikan, Saxman, Prince of Wales Island, and Metlakatla.\n\nCommencing on May 15, the installation stood as a tribute during MMIP (Missing and Murdered Indigenous People) Awareness Month, operating under a permit granted by the U.S. Forestry Service. However, as the installation's scheduled conclusion approached on May 31, distressing reports emerged-48 of the dresses had vanished without a trace. Disturbingly, social media platforms began showcasing photographs in recent days, revealing some of the dresses crumpled along the lakeside trail, partially buried, or callously abandoned near drain pipes.\n\n\"It's just disrespectful,\" Michael Toole, Ketchikan Indian Community's victim services program coordinator, told KRBD. \"It's a terrible way to discount the reality of the lives of some of these people who were missing relatives who haven't received justice.\"\n\nThe tribal council released a declaration denouncing \"a hurtful and disrespectful act that undermines the endeavors to foster understanding and increase awareness of the MMIP crisis.\"\n\nThroughout May, similar installations are showcased across Canada and the United States, intending to shed light on the excessive number of Indigenous individuals who become victims of violent crimes or disappear.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homicide ranks as the third most common cause of death among Native women, and the murder rate for those living on reservations is a staggering ten times higher than the national average. In 2021, Alaska registered 229 cases of missing and murdered Indigenous people - 149 missing and 80 murdered.\n\nGloria Burns, Vice President of KIC and Chair of the Social Services Committee, conveyed to local radio station KRBD that the tribe intentionally displayed the dresses as a symbol of remembrance and purpose, with the goal of creating a \"safe space.\"\n\n\"And so, in the midst of trying to establish a safe space, when it's deliberately made to feel unsafe, it very much feels like a violation,\" Burns told KRBD. \"I believe the challenging part is that the issue of missing and murdered indigenous people has been ongoing since colonization, but it's a topic we have largely left unaddressed. We have really not communicated these issues to the wider community.\"\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:\nThe Benefits of Nature\nJudicial Oversight Commissioner Lorraine White Sworn into Office\nCommunity Input Sought for New HAVFD Fire Station\nIroquois Museum Presents \u2013 The Mush Hole: Truth, Acknowledgement, Resilience\nAMBE Tom Longboat Run 2024!\n\u00a0\nMOST POPULAR\nThe Benefits of Nature\nJudicial Oversight Commissioner Lorraine White Sworn into Office\nCommunity Input Sought for New HAVFD Fire Station\nAlberta Residents Born Before 1984 With No Life Insurance Can Get a $250,000\nDollarGuardian\nREADER COMMENTS(0)\nLog in to add your comment \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSections\nNews\nSports\nObituaries\nHealth\nEnvironment\nCulture\nOpinion\nLifestyle\nCommunity\nClassifieds\nNewspaper\nContact\nSubscribe\nAbout\nStore\nWebsite\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nSitemap\nConnect With Us\nLocated in Akwesasne\nU.S.: (518) 358-9531\nCanada: (613) 575-2063\ninfo@indiantime.net\n\u00a9 2024 Indian Time Newspaper\nFollow Us\nRSS\n\nPowered by ROAR Online Publication Software from Lions Light Corporation\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024\n\nRendered 06/18/2024 14:33"},

The Manitoba M\u00e9tis Federation and the M\u00e9tis Nation of Ontario do not recognize the group. It is a business that makes money and is based out of a single-family home near Bancroft, Ontario, which is about 250 km northeast of Toronto.\u00a0\n\nKlein says that he claims to be M\u00e9tis because of his Indigenous mother, who died before he was born.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t self-identify, I don\u2019t use it, and I don\u2019t talk about it every time I speak. \u201cIt has to do with my mother and my family,\u201d Klein said in an interview last fall when he was running for mayor.\n\nWhen CBC News talked to Klein\u2019s brother, Christopher Rout, he said that he, his brother, and their mother are not M\u00e9tis.\n\n\u201cIn school, I learned about the M\u00e9tis. I thought I would have been taught something and told something, but neither happened. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not M\u00e9tis,\u201d Rout told CBC News in an interview. He said that if he could, he would try to become a M\u00e9tis citizen.\n\nKlein\u2019s younger brother is named Rout. Their parents are the same, but their last names are different. The marriage certificate shows that Klein changed his name from Harold Kevin Rout Jr. to Kevin Elvis Klein before his second marriage in 1994.\u00a0\n\nDavid Chartrand, the president of the Manitoba M\u00e9tis Federation, told CBC that Klein\u2019s claim to be M\u00e9tis is not true.\n\n\u201cKevin Klein does not meet any of our requirements. We don\u2019t recognize the Painted Feather Woodlands M\u00e9tis or any other group that claims to be M\u00e9tis but doesn\u2019t fit our definition. This is the same as all the other times when people or groups say they are M\u00e9tis when they really have a mixed background, Chartrand told CBC News in an email.\u00a0\n\nCBC News did research on Klein\u2019s mother\u2019s family tree, some of which went back five generations. They did not find any evidence that Klein\u2019s mother has a M\u00e9tis or other Indigenous ancestor.\n\nMost of Klein\u2019s mother\u2019s ancestors came to Canada from England or Ireland, according to the census and other historical records.\n\nHis great-grandfather, who was born in 1889 and came from Jersey, one of the British Islands, was the last person he knew who moved to Canada. Two of his great-grandmother\u2019s grandparents were born in England, and the other two were born in Ireland.\n\nKlein\u2019s great-grandmother, who was born in 1875 and whose death certificate said she was English, was the only ancestor whose roots could not be found in another country. In the 1861 census, all four of her grandparents, three of whom were born in the U.S. and one in Canada, said they were not \u201cIndian.\u201d\n\nIn an interview in January, Premier Stefanson said that Klein is one of two Indigenous MLAs in the Progressive Conservative caucus. She also talked about how important it was for her party to have Indigenous people in it so that it better reflected the province\u2019s population.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe need to get more Indigenous candidates, and we\u2019re working on that,\u201d Stefanson said. \u201cWe need more diversity in how we choose candidates.\u201d\n\nWhen told that there was no proof of Klein\u2019s M\u00e9tis ancestry and that Chartrand and Klein\u2019s brother had said things, a spokesperson for Stefanson wouldn\u2019t say if the premier still thought Klein was a member of the Indigenous PC caucus.\n\n\u201cBecause we have worked hard to become the most diverse party in Manitoba, we are proud to have the first Muslim minister of the Crown, the first Black minister, and the first woman premier in our caucus. \u201cMinister Klein has made it clear that he is on a personal journey and that he is not using his ancestry to get ahead in politics,\u201d the spokesperson wrote.\n\nThe spokesperson said that the premier is happy with how PC Party candidates are vetted, but he questioned whether New Democrats are happy with how their candidates are vetted after it came out in 2017 that NDP Leader Wab Kinew had been convicted of crimes and had domestic violence charges against him dropped from about 20 years ago.\n\nJean Teillet, a M\u00e9tis lawyer and Louis Riel\u2019s great-grandniece, says that universities, governments, and other organizations are currently trying to hire Indigenous people. This could help a candidate who says they are Indigenous in an interview.\n\nTeillet said that it helps the PC party as well.\n\n\u201cThey stand up and say, \u2018We have Indigenous people in our party, so you can see we\u2019re not against Indigenous people. Look, they speak for their people.'\u201d\n\n\u2018M\u00e9tis\u2019 disappear\n\nThis past year, Klein ran two campaigns in Winnipeg, which according to Statistics Canada data from 2021 has the most Indigenous people living there than any other city in Canada.\u00a0\n\nAfter failing to become mayor, he won the Kirkfield Park provincial byelection.\u00a0\n\nKlein called himself a \u201cproud M\u00e9tis Canadian\u201d on his X account, which used to be called Twitter, and on his website at different times during the campaigns.\n\nOver the past few months, the word \u201cM\u00e9tis\u201d has been taken out of Klein\u2019s personal accounts, first from his X biography and then from his personal website, but the government record hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nWhen Klein was named to cabinet at the end of January, the government sent out a news release with background information. It said, \u201cKlein is a proud M\u00e9tis Canadian and continues to explore, working with Elders in Manitoba to research his connections to the Indigenous community.\u201d That exact phrase is also in his bio on the government website and on the Progressive Conservative Party website.\n\nWhen CBC News asked Klein for an interview to talk about his biography in the province\u2019s news release, his press secretary said he is not available and that his \u201cbio seems to explain itself.\u201d\n\nWhen CBC News asked why the word \u201cM\u00e9tis\u201d was taken off of Klein\u2019s personal website, Klein\u2019s press secretary wrote, \u201cAs Minister Klein has said before, \u2018This is a private and personal journey.'\u201d\n\nSince then, his personal website has changed again. It now says, \u201cConnecting with my Indigenous heritage helps put life into perspective,\u201d and at the top it says, \u201cRe-elect Kevin Klein.\u201d\u00a0\n\nKlein, who is 58 years old, has talked to the media in the past about his membership card from the Painted Feather Woodland M\u00e9tis, a group that is not recognized by the Manitoba M\u00e9tis Federation or the M\u00e9tis Nation of Ontario.\u00a0\n\nThe Government of Canada says that only the M\u00e9tis Nation of Alberta, the Manitoba M\u00e9tis Federation, the M\u00e9tis Nation of Saskatchewan, the M\u00e9tis Nation of British Columbia, and the M\u00e9tis Nation of Ontario are allowed to decide who is a M\u00e9tis with rights under the Constitution.\n\nTwo candidates want to be the second Indigenous mayor of Winnipeg.\nThe M\u00e9tis Nation of Ontario votes to kick out people whose files aren\u2019t complete.\n\nTeillet won a case before the Supreme Court of Canada in 2003. The court said that a person can be considered M\u00e9tis and have rights under Section 35 of the Constitution if they pass a test called the Powley test. Section 35 recognizes the \u201caboriginal and treaty rights of the Aboriginal people of Canada,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t say what those rights are.\n\nPart of the Powley test tells you what you need to do to be eligible: you must say you are M\u00e9tis, be accepted as a member of a modern M\u00e9tis community, and have ties to a historic M\u00e9tis community.\n\nWho are the M\u00e9tis and what are their rights? This is part of a unit on identity.\n\nPainted Feather Woodland M\u00e9tis doesn\u2019t agree with what it calls \u201coverly restrictive and unfair\u201d definitions of who is M\u00e9tis. Instead, it says its definition is \u201csimple: anyone with an aboriginal ancestor,\u201d according to the company\u2019s website, which also lists fees for membership for adults ranging from $57 to $320, plus provincial sales tax.\n\nIn the past, Painted Feather turned down an interview request and sent CBC News to its website to find out more.\n\nKlein has said that he didn\u2019t say he was M\u00e9tis for political reasons, and he got his membership card before he got into politics.\n\nIndigenous ancestry is a complicated topic, so CBC News did its research with the help of Indigenous experts and journalists.\u00a0\n\nAs an elected minister in the Manitoba government, Klein\u2019s claims will be looked at by journalists in the same way they look at the claims of other high-ranking elected officials.\n\nKlein\u2019s lawyer says the matter is \u201cprivate.\n\nSince becoming a cabinet minister, Klein has turned down CBC News\u2019s request to talk to them about new information they have about his claim to be M\u00e9tis.\n\nKlein\u2019s lawyer, Sacha Paul of Thompson Dorfman Sweatman, sent a letter to CBC News in April asking them to stop asking about Klein\u2019s background and to stop talking to his family about it.\n\nPaul wrote, \u201cMr. Klein has told me that the issue of his Indigenous heritage is a personal one and that his campaign materials do not emphasize his connection to his Indigenous ancestry.\u201d\n\nRed flag\n\nJean Teillet said, \u201cOnce we can all say we\u2019re Indigenous for any reason, there won\u2019t be any Indigenous people left, because we\u2019ll all be Indigenous.\u201d\u00a0\n\nShe says it\u2019s bad because it\u2019s another step toward getting rid of Indigenous people. She calls this \u201creverse assimilation.\u201d\n\nTeillet was hired by the University of Saskatchewan as an independent investigator to figure out how to stop false claims of Indigenous ancestry. This was done after professor Carrie Bourassa was put on leave and then resigned after a CBC investigation found no proof that she was Indigenous.\n\nThe Painted Feather Woodland M\u00e9tis is one of many groups that have \u201csprung up\u201d since 2002. Teillet said that these groups \u201chave a very, very loose definition of what they call M\u00e9tis, which is basically anyone who has even a tiny bit of Indigenous ancestry.\u201d\n\nIn academia, people are encouraged to lie about being indigenous. Here\u2019s how to fix it.\n\nTeillet\u2019s report for the University of Saskatchewan, called \u201cIndigenous Identity Fraud,\u201d found similarities between different cases of false claims of Indigeneity, which she calls \u201cred flags.\u201d\n\nKlein told What\u2019s Up Winnipeg reporter Dorothy Dobbie during his run for mayor that he took an Indigenous course at the University of Alberta \u201cto learn more about his M\u00e9tis and Cree background.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome Native American groups in the middle of the country had a lot of people with blonde hair and blue eyes. His family says that you can see his roots in his cheekbones, but Kevin says he could never grow a real beard!\u201d wrote Dobbie, a former Progressive Conservative MP who wrote the profile of Klein before the civic election.\n\nTeillet wrote in her report for the University of Saskatchewan that the changing identities of Indigenous people should be a red flag.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey changed their stories when people didn\u2019t believe them. One great example is Joseph Boyden. Teillet said in an interview, \u201cI think he changed his name about 10 times over the years.\u201d\n\nAn investigation by APTN found no proof that Boyden, who has written about Indigenous people and culture in his books, has any Indigenous ancestors.\n\nTeillet said, \u201cIf [Klein] follows the pattern that everyone else has followed, he\u2019ll keep changing his stories over and over again.\u201d\n\nAfter an investigation, author Joseph Boyden stands up for Indigenous culture.\nIndigenous identity and Joseph Boyden\u2019s case;\n\nTeillet said that when people who say they are Indigenous but can\u2019t prove it speak for Indigenous people, Indigenous people aren\u2019t heard.\u00a0\n\n\u201cEvery time someone like that speaks on behalf of Indigenous people, they take the microphone away from real Indigenous people,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about my mom and family,\u201d I said\n\nKlein told CBC News last year, when he was running for mayor, that his claim to M\u00e9tis heritage was a way for him to connect with his late mother, Joanne Winacott.\n\nIn 1991, when she was 45 years old, her second husband killed her in her Oshawa home.\n\nKlein was 26 years old.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to claim any rights or think that this will help me in any way. In an interview in September, Klein said, \u201cIt\u2019s about my mom and my family.\u201d\n\nKlein has spoken out about the murder of his mother. He still has a section of his personal website, which he used to run for office, that is about his mother.\n\nOn April 5, the day of his mother\u2019s birthday, he talked about her death and domestic violence in the legislature.\n\nWhen Klein was a city councillor for Charleswood-Tuxedo-Westwood, he talked about the death of his mother during a debate about the budget for the Winnipeg Police Service:\n\n\u201cI want to talk about something that no one else in the council can talk about. \u201cMy Native mother was killed,\u201d Klein said at a meeting of the Winnipeg city council in December 2021.\n\nOn Red Dress Day, May 5, 2022, the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, Klein posted a video to Instagram saying, \u201cMy mother was killed by her partner, and she was Indigenous,\u201d in front of the red dresses that were on display at Winnipeg City Hall for the event.\n\nKlein\u2019s lawyer said in a letter from April that the media, including CBC, can ask about Klein\u2019s record and what he has done for his constituents, but not about \u201cpersonal matters.\u201d\n\nPaul wrote, \u201cFrom our client\u2019s point of view, his heritage is one of the few ties he has to his late mother, who was taken from him when he was a child.\u201d\n\nIn a second email sent in the middle of July, Paul said that Klein is \u201ca firm believer in the freedom of the press and responsible journalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, it is not responsible journalism to keep bringing up a personal matter that has to do with the sad death of my client\u2019s mother,\u201d Paul wrote.\n\nThe lawyer wanted to know for sure that CBC News \u201cwill not run this story now or in the future.\u201d\n\nTeillet\u2019s report also says that it\u2019s a red flag when people talk about Indigenous trauma in public places more than once.\n\n\u201cSomeone killed his mother. Teillet said in an interview, \u201cThat\u2019s real trauma, but it has nothing to do with Indigenous identity.\u201d \u201cIt is a sad story about how his mother was killed.\u201d\n\nTeillet doesn\u2019t understand why Klein ties his claim to M\u00e9tis heritage to his mother\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cIs he saying, \u2018Oh, she was murdered, you know, she\u2019s part of that murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls story,\u2019 and that if you can show trauma in your life, that\u2019s a good reason to identify as Indigenous?'\u201d\n\nIn her report for the University of Saskatchewan, Teillet finds a pattern in the cases she looked at.\n\n\u201cIndigenous identity thieves often rely heavily on stereotypes about being disconnected from their culture and heritage, intergenerational trauma, family violence, addictions, racism, and poverty. By doing this, the scammers are \u201cmarketing trauma\u201d by using \u201cstolen trauma and stolen valour.\u201d She used research done by Sherry Farrell Racette in her report.\n\nRout says he doesn\u2019t like how Klein talks about the death of their mother in public.\n\nKlein started his Instagram account right before he ran for city council in 2018. It has at least 15 posts about the murder of his mother, as well as ads for his campaigns for city councillor, mayor, and MLA in 2022.\n\nHe also talks about his mother\u2019s murder on his\u00a0personal site, which he also uses for campaign purposes.\n\nRout said he dislikes the way Klein uses his mother\u2019s memory in his public posts.\n\n\u201cTo me, a son\u2019s job is to defend their mom, defend their mom\u2019s story, not exploit it for any gain. So I will stand and defend it all day long,\u201d Rout, a paramedic with Alberta Health Services, said in an interview with CBC News.\n\nIndigenous identity requires connectio\n\nKlein completed the University of Alberta\u2019s Indigenous Canada course in 2020\u00a0and posted the certificate on his website. The free online instruction program covers the histories and current perspectives of Indigenous Peoples in Canada.\n\nEarly in the course,\u00a0University of Alberta professor Kim TallBear\u00a0says having an Indigenous relative does not make you Indigenous.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just have the right as an individual to go claim to be a member of a community that does not know you, within which you have not been socialized and that does not claim you,\u201d TallBear said in a module of the course.\n\nKlein is adamant that his M\u00e9tis heritage is a private and personal journey, but Teillet says that\u2019s not how it works.\n\n\u201cThis idea that it\u2019s a personal journey and no one can question it \u2026 it\u2019s BS, right? We shouldn\u2019t give it credit. And so if he\u2019s on a personal journey for six to eight years, trying to find an Indigenous identity somewhere, then personally, I think he should shut up about it until he figures it out,\u201d Teillet said.\n\nPREV\nNEXT\n\nWe covers local, national and international news and offers columns and commentary from a variety of sources.\n\nKnow More\nSince 2019, 14 whales and 1 dolphin have died at Marineland, according to documents from the ministry\nHow motion-activated cameras may reveal the secrets of a healthy herd of caribou in Manitob\nFan Expo Canada is back, and it\u2019s more important than ever that it\u2019s led by women\n2024 Ottawa Express"},

It\u2019s a day to raise awareness and remember those who have been lost over the years.\n\nRed Dress Day started in 2010 as REDress project established by Indigenous artist Jamie Black.\n\nAt the Ki-Lo-Na Friendship Society, the event included an opening prayer from an elder and singing and drumming led by Krystal Lezard.\n\nParticipants then planned to march to the Kelowna courthouse.\n\nSimilar events were held across the country and many posts on social media featured Indigenous women with red handprints across their mouths to symbolize solidarity with MMIWG and represent the thousands who have been silenced.\n\nSimilar events were held across the country.\n\nThe final report of the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls was released in June 2019.

A day where hearts hang heavy as red dresses drape with honour, and pride throughout numerous communities across the nation to remember and raise awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, and Girls (MMIWG) who were taken too soon, and lost to the hands of violence.\n\nA gathering was held at the Kwakiutl First Nation\u2019s Gukwdzi (Big House) to remember, educate, and raise awareness for all the women, girls, men, boys, and two-spirited that have gone missing. With over 200 people coming out to show their support, most of whom were wearing red, the event opened around 1:30 p.m. with introductory speeches and then cultural songs and dances.\n\nEveryone that came out for the gathering was invited to stay for food, performances, and closing remarks and prayers.\n\nRed Dress Day, also known as the Red Dress Campaign, sparked from the REDress Project which was first conceived on May 5, 2010 in Winnipeg, Manitoba through the inspired work of M\u00e9tis artist Jamie Black. When Black was told by one of her Indigenous friends that red is the only colour spirits can see, and that is actually a callback for spirits to be among us again, a red dress became the catalyst for her display at the University of Winnipeg. It featured many hung empty to honour and symbolize all Indigenous women and girls lost to violence.\n\nThe annually recognized Red Dress Day draws attention to more than 1,000 Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in Canada.\n\nThe country continues to take steps towards truth and reconciliation. It was earlier this week on May 2, that the House of Commons adopted a motion to declare ongoing violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people a national emergency.\n\n\nchadd.cawson@cowichanvalleycitizen.com\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n\nAbout the Author: Black Press Media Staff\n\nRead more\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tPort Hardy RCMP seize large quantity of drugs and cash\n\t\tSurviving the flu really makes you appreciate being healthy\n\t\t'We should be in crisis mode': B.C. wildfire ecologist\n\t\tTri-Port celebrates Canada Day\n\t\tFaster internet now available for 5 more island communities\nFacebook Comments (0) \nYOUR VOTE MATTERS\nLooks like you have voted in all of our community polls.

What is that? Is that Herbal Essence?\u201d Drake asked as the audience egged him on (per USA Today).

Cole\u2019s 2023 song First Person Shooter, in which Cole referred to the three of them as the industry\u2019s three greatest hip-hop artists. \u201cWe the big three like we started a league,\u201d Cole rapped.\n\nAdvertisement 10\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nLamar dismissed that declaration on Future and Metro Boomin\u2019s Like That, spitting back, \u201cIt\u2019s just big me.\u201d He also hit out at Drake on back-to-back diss tracks Euphoria and 6:16 in LA in which he called the lyricist \u201ca terrible person.\u201d\n\nCole waded into the fray briefly (\u201cHe still doing shows but fell off like The Simpsons,\u201d he swiped) and then apologized admitting Lamar is \u201cone of the greatest.\u201d\n\nOn Push Ups, Drake fired back by mocking Lamar for appearing on songs by Maroon 5 and Taylor Swift and made digs at the Compton freestyler\u2019s short stature, calling him a \u201cpipsqueak.\u201d \u00a0On another diss track, Taylor Made Freestyle, Drake used AI-generated rhymes by Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg to further besmirch Lamar\u2019s name. Swift also got dragged into their back-and-forth battle when Drake declared she\u2019s the \u201cbiggest gangster in the music game right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 11\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe pair\u2019s feud stretches back more than a decade when Lamar rapped on the Big Sean song Control about how he wanted to \u201cmurder\u201d the former Degrassi star.\n\n\u201cIt just sounded like an ambitious thought to me. That\u2019s all it was. I know good and well that (Lamar)\u2019s not murdering me, at all, in any platform,\u201d Drake told Billboard at the time.\n\nBut with the release of The Heart Part 6, Drake seemed to confirm that the beef is nearing an end.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t wanna diss you anymore, this really got me second-guessing,\u201d he raps, adding in the spoken-word outro, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie, this s\u2014 was some good exercise. It\u2019s good to get out, get the pen working.\u201d\n\nEven if it\u2019s not over, Rolling Stone has declared Lamar the winner of what it called the \u201cGreat Rap War.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 12\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cOverall, Kendrick\u2019s shots hit harder,\u201d the publication wrote on Monday. \u201cHe rapped about Drake\u2019s racial identity issues, his alleged vices, his lack of street smarts, his shady behind-the-scenes tactics, his transactional relationships in Atlanta, his alliance with Baka, leaks in his OVO camp, and most alarmingly, his alleged inappropriate engagements with teenage girls. It feels like he got most of his information from social media, and some of it remains to be corroborated, but he still properly executed it in the court of public opinion.\u201d\n\nmdaniell@postmedia.com\n\nRECOMMENDED FROM EDITORIAL\nDrake offers to pay for fan's divorce: 'I'm going to get you a good lawyer'\nThe Kendrick Lamar, Drake, J Cole beef explained\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nStop Buying Lottery Tickets & Start Doing This Instead!\nYukon\n|\nSponsored\nClick Here\nCops hunt for suspect after child sexually assaulted\nWinnipeg Sun\nManitoba RCMP shoot and kill man who was allegedly assaulting a woman\nWinnipeg Sun\nCasinos Hate You Doing This.

After a rainy day in Canada, which required the Duchess to (gasp) shield herself with an umbrella for her engagements in Bella Bella, the Duchess went ultra-glam Monday evening, in British Columbia, as she wore a \u00a31,000 red Preen dress, alongside Prince William, for a reconciliation ceremony with Canadian First Nations groups.\n\nKate paired the look\u2014which offered us a rare asymmetric neckline (by Kate standards, this is some wild stuff)\u2014with the royal family\u2019s diamond maple-leaf brooch, which had been given to the Queen Mother by her husband, King George VI, to commemorate their visit to Canada in 1939. (Kate has used her wardrobe to pay tribute to the host nation throughout her stay, wearing a maple-leaf brooch upon her arrival, as well as a red-and-white McQueen dress on the second day of the tour.)\n\nKate and William hobnobbed with 200 guests in the ballroom at Government House, in Victoria, after having met with about 25 representatives for a ceremony that, per the Daily Mail, was \u201cdesigned to heal the wounds of conflict between indigenous people and the government.\u201d\n\nWATCH NOW:\n\nAnne Hathaway Rewatches The Princess Diaries, The Devil Wears Prada & More\n\nOn the itinerary for today, for the couple: stops at a university, where they will watch a women\u2019s volleyball match; at a winery, for a \u201cTaste of British Columbia\u201d festival; and finally in Whitehorse, Yukon, where they will watch a performance, and stay the night.\n\nALL OF KATE MIDDLETON\u2019S LOOKS ON THE 2016 CANADA TOUR\n1 / 14\nBY SAMIR HUSSEIN/WIREIMAGE.\nFor her final tour look, Kate went classic: white (Catherine Walker) coat, immaculate hair, nude LK Bennett shoes.\nMOST POPULAR\nPOLITICS\nRFK Jr.\u2019s Family Doesn\u2019t Want Him to Run.

ANNA McKENZIE, THE DISCOURSE\n\nA Ladysmith-area First Nation joined forces with the town\u2019s council, firefighters and other residents on Saturday to replace red dresses hanging by the Island Highway that were taken down in an incident caught on video.\n\nMore than 100 red dresses had been hung along the highway on Family Day, from Victoria to Port Hardy, in honour of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, trans and Two Spirit people.\n\nNanaimo resident Tina Henderson says she had just finished work and was waiting for her sushi order at Sushi Wara in Ladysmith on April 10 when she noticed two people on the opposite side of the highway using large sticks to take down red dresses and hoisting them out of sight, into the bush.\n\n\u201cWe have to as a community, as people, stand up for our missing and murdered Indigenous women, men and children, and to me, that was like a huge violation,\u201d says Henderson.\n\nShe says she considered driving across the highway, so she could yell and honk at them, but she figured it was more important to capture what was happening on video.\n\nInitially, she wasn\u2019t sure what to do with the video, so she talked with her \u201cgo-to\u201d activist friend, Stephanie Goudie, who posted it on Facebook.\n\nThe use of the red dress was originally inspired by the REDress Project, which was initiated by Anishnaabe artist Jaime Black as an \u201caesthetic response to this critical national issue,\u201d according to Black\u2019s website.\n\nThe video has prompted anger, sadness and outrage in the community.\n\nRoxanne Harris, chief of the Stz\u2019uminus First Nation, says she was shocked and disheartened when the video clip was brought to her attention.

ANNA McKENZIE, THE DISCOURSE\n\nA Ladysmith-area First Nation joined forces with the town\u2019s council, firefighters and other residents on Saturday to replace red dresses hanging by the Island Highway that were taken down in an incident caught on video.\n\nMore than 100 red dresses had been hung along the highway on Family Day, from Victoria to Port Hardy, in honour of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, trans and Two Spirit people.\n\nNanaimo resident Tina Henderson says she had just finished work and was waiting for her sushi order at Sushi Wara in Ladysmith on April 10 when she noticed two people on the opposite side of the highway using large sticks to take down red dresses and hoisting them out of sight, into the bush.\n\n\u201cWe have to as a community, as people, stand up for our missing and murdered Indigenous women, men and children, and to me, that was like a huge violation,\u201d says Henderson.\n\nShe says she considered driving across the highway, so she could yell and honk at them, but she figured it was more important to capture what was happening on video.\n\nInitially, she wasn\u2019t sure what to do with the video, so she talked with her \u201cgo-to\u201d activist friend, Stephanie Goudie, who posted it on Facebook.\n\nThe use of the red dress was originally inspired by the REDress Project, which was initiated by Anishnaabe artist Jaime Black as an \u201caesthetic response to this critical national issue,\u201d according to Black\u2019s website.\n\nThe video has prompted anger, sadness and outrage in the community.\n\nRoxanne Harris, chief of the Stz\u2019uminus First Nation, says she was shocked and disheartened when the video clip was brought to her attention. After viewing it, she called the mayor of Ladysmith, Aaron Stone.\n\n\u201cWe have a good working relationship,\u201d she says.\n\nLadysmith town council and the Stz\u2019uminus chief and council gathered on Saturday to put red dresses up where they were taken down.\n\nHarris says other community members also lent a hand, including the Ladysmith Fire Department and the people behind the Ladysmith Festival of Lights.\n\n\u201cWe are working together to try and remedy the situation,\u201d says Harris, adding that people who want to contribute can drop off red dresses at Ladysmith City Hall.

Joy Flett is the knowledge keeper for her close and extended relatives, but pieces of her family tree have been stolen, and she feels a heartache that is shared by countless other Indigenous families across Canada. Both women will be wearing red on May 5.\n\nAlso known as Red Dress Day, May 5 marks a day to honour, remember and create awareness and action for Missing, Murdered and Exploited Indigenous Peoples (MMEIP) in Canada. The statistics are startling -Indigenous women in Canada today are seven times more likely than non-Indigenous women to be a murder victim, and three times more likely to be violently or sexually assaulted.\n\nLana, originally from Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan, and Joy, from the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation in Alberta, are part of Suncor's Indigenous and Community Relations team in Fort McMurray, Alta. They both agree that more action is needed to end the MMEIP crisis.\n\n\"Since the time of residential schools and everything leading to today, we've been stripped of our names, our languages, our hair. To be able to take back our power and voice, we need to keep speaking out against what is happening,\" says Joy. \"There are so many Indigenous people who've gone missing or have been murdered in our own city. We need to continue to say their names. They are important to somebody. We can all play a role in ending the violence.\"\n\nOne of the national organizations helping to move the needle with this progress is the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC). For almost 50 years NWAC has played a lead role in advocating for the rights of Indigenous women, girls, two-spirit, transgender and gender-diverse people, which includes critical advocacy on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG2S+) and reconciliation. The organization has been pressing the federal government to act since the National Inquiry issued the 231 Calls for Justice in 2019.\n\nLesen Sie auch\n\u00d6lpreis vor Neubewertung\nBrent \u00d6l knackt Widerstand und startet durch\n02.07.24, 17:21\nAttraktive Bewertungslage\nEnergieaktien bieten Chancen trotz \u2013 oder wegen \u2013 Rezessions\u00e4ngsten\n02.07.24, 05:32\nEnergiewende ad\u00e9\nBP verschiebt Fokus zur\u00fcck auf \u00d6l und Gas \u2013 Schock und Jubel zugleich!\n27.06.24, 10:31\nGute Aussichten f\u00fcr Nebenwerte\nKleine Unternehmen vor gro\u00dfem Aufschwung\n26.06.24, 11:44\n\nWhen reflecting on Red Dress Day, NWAC urges Canadians to consider the many aspects of colonization that continue to affect Indigenous people. NWAC's Chief Executive Officer, Lynne Groulx, believes that a critical component to reconciliation is acknowledging the past.\n\n\"We invite everyone across the country to play an active role in reconciliation through education and raising awareness, as well as learning about Indigenous knowledge systems and the impacts of colonialism and racism that face many Indigenous people,\" says Lynne. \"We have taken urgent and significant action to increase awareness and address the 231 Calls for Justice and have been working hard to implement our own MMIWG2S+ Action Plan.\"\n\nNWAC's Action Plan includes 66 concrete actions they will take to help end the MMEIP. Last year NWAC reported progress on over 85 per cent of the proposed actions. This includes the Safe Passage Platform - a national reporting tool that maps cases of MMIWG2S+ and provides information on resources and services available across the country.\n\nLynne also suggests reading books, listening to podcasts or participating in educational programs created by Indigenous authors and media to see the world through their lens. She also encourages people to help amplify messages and initiatives from Indigenous voices to ensure they are being heard.\n\nOn May 5 and beyond, both Lana and Joy will be found honouring and remembering - the missing, murdered and exploited Indigenous peoples - in their own way of healing and active support.\n\n\"Through my mom's experience growing up of being called a dirty Indian, to now my 15-year-old daughter who is able to stand proud and march to the beat of her own drum, we can see there has been a lot of progress for Indigenous people to feel seen and accepted,\" says Lana. \"But we also must acknowledge the pain and trauma that is still prevalent today. We are not victims, we are survivors.\"\n\nView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Suncor Energy on 3blmedia.com.\n\nContact Info:\nSpokesperson: Suncor Energy\nWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/suncor-energy\nEmail: info@3blmedia.com\n\nSOURCE: Suncor Energy\n\n\n\nView source version on accesswire.com:\nhttps://www.accesswire.com/754300/Suncor-Indigenous-Employees-Lana-and ...\n\n\nThe Suncor Energy Stock at the time of publication of the news with a fall of -1,26\u00a0% to 39,18CAD on Toronto stock exchange (10.

We are hopeful for a significant turnout, demonstrating a community-wide commitment to addressing and combating this violence.\u201d\n\nRed dresses of any size and style may be dropped off at the front desk of the Ashnola Building at the Okanagan College campus in Penticton.\n\nRed Dress Day was first observed in Winnipeg in 2010, when Metis artist Jamie Black hung hundreds of the garments in public places to call attention to the plight of Indigenous women.\n\nIndigenous women account for 16% of all female homicide victims and 11% of missing women, but Indigenous people make up only about 4.3% of Canada\u2019s population, according to the Assembly of First Nations.\n\nApproximately 13% of Indigenous people experience intimate partner violence, compared to 5.7% of the total population.\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nCopy article link\nSave\nTags\nClothing Ethnology Crime\nRecommended for you\nMost Popular\n Articles\nCelebrating July 1 in the South Okanagan\n700 cars in Penticton, here are the winners...\nPen-Hi Scholarships and Bursaries\nNHL star lists Lake Huron mansion for $7.9M: 'Takes your breath away'\nHave you seen this person?\nPedophilic Summerland lifeguard returned to jail after reviving 'crime cycle'\nPrincess Margaret celebrates graduates\nCanada Day Quiz: Okanagan edition\nMa-and-pa market focuses on mediterranean meals\nLetters to the Editor (8): Friday, June 28, 2024\nSubmit Your News\n\nWe're always interested in hearing about news in our community.

The artwork is part of that project.\n\nThe relationship between Indigenous communities and police can often be difficult, with improvements to accountability an important part of the Calls to Justice in Final Report on MMIWG, released in 2021.\n\nRivers said change within the police service takes time, but it\u2019s something they\u2019re to which they are committee.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cWe work hard to make ourselves better as a police service and we welcome the opportunity to learn,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cI think the ongoing partnerships with all the Indigenous organizations, especially the Friendship Centre, it just goes to show that we as a police service are trying to change and make things better.\u201d\n\nMeawasige said she hopes the new sculpture will provide an important visual reminder to the whole community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be very much available for everyone to see, day or night,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re just hoping that there\u2019s a better understanding of why the N\u2019Swakamok Native Friendship Centre and the Greater Sudbury Police have worked together to promote awareness and to continue to work so there\u2019ll be (fewer) murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls in our communities, not just in Sudbury, but all over Canada.\u201d\n\nThe Local Journalism Initiative is made possible through funding from the federal government.\n\nmjensen@postmedia.com\n\nTwitter: @mia_rjensen\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nLATEST NATIONAL STORIES\nNEWS NEAR TIMMINS\nTHIS WEEK IN FLYERS"},

(Photo by Matteo Cimellaro/Canada\u2019s National Observer)\n\nBy Matteo Cimellaro, Local Journalism Initiative Reporter, Canada\u2019s National Observer\n\nWARNING: This story contains distressing details.\n\nOn May 2, the House of Commons unanimously passed a motion declaring the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people a national emergency.\n\nThe motion was tabled by Leah Gazan, NDP critic for women and gender equity, and arrived just before Red Dress Day on May 5.\n\nThe adopted motion included a call to provide immediate and substantial investment in a red dress alert system to help notify the public when an Indigenous woman, girl or two-spirit person goes missing.\n\nAt a press conference on the morning of the motion, Gazan was flanked by several grassroots First Nation, M\u00e9tis and Inuit advocates and activists. She emphasized during the press conference that structures are in place to create the alert system immediately.\n\nGazan has met with Public Safety Minister Bill Blair to discuss a path forward, she told Canada\u2019s National Observer. But her patience is running out.\n\n\u201cThey just need to come to the table and then act,\u201d Gazan said. \u201cI\u2019m done with meeting for the sake of meeting.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s beyond \u201cfeel-good stuff\u201d \u2014 action needs to happen, she added.\n\nCurrently, the government has earmarked $2.5 million over five years to implement the missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and two-spirited National Action Plan, but Gazan says action needs to happen now, pointing to the recent discovery of the remains of an eight-year-old girl from Samson Cree Nation and the death of a woman from Sandy Bay First Nation over the weekend.\n\nREAD MORE: Possible remains of allegedly murdered eight-year-old discovered in Maskwacis\n\nBut this year\u2019s federal budget notably clawed back $150 million of funding for women\u2019s shelters, a move that \u201creally, really worries\u201d Carol McBride, president of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada.\n\n\u201cI hope this resolution means that [the federal government] will be looking at that funding that they\u2019re planning on clawing back.\u201d\n\nIn question period, the Liberals pointed to the end of the pandemic as a reason to cut the shelter funds, Gazan said.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic is over, but not the violence pandemic \u2026 The violence pandemic continues,\u201d Gazan said.\n\nAt the press conference, Ellen Gabriel, an activist and filmmaker from Kanehsat\u00e0:ke, directly blamed politicians and bureaucrats for inaction.\n\n\u201cIt becomes a matter of economics. It goes to the Treasury Board, rather than looking at educating you leaders, your politicians, about what human rights actually means,\u201d Gabriel said.\n\n\u201cEvery single one of us knows what it is to breathe, everyone knows what it means to lose a loved one.

It\u2019s over 64 per cent of the Indigenous women population who have suffered, passed away, have gone missing, or have been assaulted in all different ways. Nothing has been done for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know a few women who have gone missing, and I\u2019ve worked in the community\u2026it\u2019s quite significant [to me]\u201d, she added.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA woman marching in downtown Edmonton for Red Dress Day (Photo credits \u2013 Keith Driver)\n\nListen to the full interview with Colleen Dollfusz below:\n\nAudio Player\n00:00\n00:00\nUse Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\n\nDo you have a story idea?

Herald file photo by Ian Martens @IMartensHerald\n\nThe Herald takes a look back at the Lethbridge stories that made headlines in 2020 in a month by month series running through this week to New Year\u2019s Eve\n\nOCTOBER\n\nOPS appears at Police Commission\nRepresentatives of the Lethbridge Overdose Prevention Society made a brief presentation to the Lethbridge Police Commission about what their purposes are in the community, and what they intend to do going forward. Group spokesperson Kaley Ann Beaudoin told commissioners they have applied for a legal exemption from Health Canada to offer sanctioned overdose prevention services in Lethbridge, but in the meantime would continue to operate as an unsanctioned OPS site despite some community opposition.\n\nLPS won\u2019t support Phillips\u2019 appeal\nLethbridge Chief of Police Shahin Mehdizadeh says the Lethbridge Police Service will not be supporting Lethbridge-West MLA Shannon Phillips\u2019 appeal to the Law Enforcement Review Board (LERB), nor her request for a public hearing, on a discipline decision made against two LPS officers who admitted to undertaking an unauthorized surveillance of her in 2017 when she was Alberta\u2019s Minister of Environment.\n\nVigil sheds light on missing and murdered Indigenous women\nIndigenous women and girls who have gone missing and murdered were remembered in a vigil. The Sisters In Spirit Vigil honoured the lives of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two Spirited and brought awareness to the violence experienced by Indigenous women and girls in Canada.\n\nU of L moves up to second in Maclean\u2019s rankings\nThe University of Lethbridge has achieved its highest-ever position in the annual Maclean\u2019s University Rankings Report, placing second overall in the primarily undergraduate classification. Moving up three spots from its fifth-place ranking a year ago, the U of L bettered its previous best standing, a third-place ranking that it occupied for six consecutive years, 2013-2017.\n\nMorning fire damages westside apartment building\nResidents of a large westside apartment complex on the 300 block of Highlands Boulevard West will be seeking temporary shelter this weekend after an early morning fire did substantial damage to their building. According to the Lethbridge fire department, the blaze began just before 8 a.m. on a second-storey outside balcony of one unit in the complex and quickly spread up to the third floor into the attic, eventually fully engulfing the roof of one whole section of the building.\n\nMan charged in fatal highway crash back in custody\nA Lethbridge man for whom police have been searching since he disappeared while on bail in June is back in jail after being arrested late last month. Wesley Brian Phillips, who is in custody at the Calgary Remand Centre, was wanted in connection with a fatal car collision last year. A warrant was issued June 12 when he failed to show up for court, even though he had, through his previous lawyer, been ordered to attend court after he was a no-show for a docket appearance the week before.\n\nShandro won\u2019t overturn decision\nMinister of Health Tyler Shandro will not intervene in an Alberta Health Services decision to end its local EMS dispatch contracts in Lethbridge, Calgary, Wood Buffalo and Red Deer. \u201cMy decision is not to overturn the AHS decision,\u201d he writes, \u201cand I look forward to supporting them and your municipalities during the transition to ensure that emergency health services can improve.\n\nLPS chief makes pitch for programs\nThe Lethbridge Police Service presented its quarterly report to city council on Monday, but also took the opportunity to get in an extra pitch to retain three programs brought in over the past few years for trial runs: The Watch program; the Community Peace Officer program; and the PACT (Police and Crisis Team).\n\nVersteeg set to do \u2018Battle\u2019 on the ice\nKris Versteeg is lacing up the skates to do battle again but this time it won\u2019t be in front of 20,000 fans at a National Hockey League game. Instead, the retired 34-year-old Stanley Cup champion and Lethbridge native will be skating for a televised audience in the CBC series \u201cBattle of the Blades.\u201d Versteeg and his professional skating partner Carlotta Edwards are among eight teams competing in the series for a $100,000 grand prize which will go to the winner\u2019s charity of choice.\n\nAlberta health-care workers walk off job to protest cuts during pandemic\nHospital and other health-care workers across Alberta, including Lethbridge, walked off the job Monday to protest recent cuts by the United Conservative government during the COVID-19 pandemic. Guy Smith, president of the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, said in a news release that members are trying to defend jobs and protect the public health-care system.\n\nVocal opposition against coal mine\nOpposition is heating up against the proposed Benga mining company Grassy Mountain coal mine near Blairmore as the Joint Review panel starts to consider whether or not to approve the project with the opening of a public hearing.\n\nCoaldale council rejects mask bylaw\nCoaldale Town Council strongly suggested local residents and business owners should consider wearing a mask or face covering when out in public as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in the region, but stopped short of implementing a mandatory face covering bylaw by a vote of 6-1.\n\nCity tops national crime index\nLethbridge once again ranked first in the annual Crime Severity Index (CSI) for Canada in 2019. Although the city did not have the highest score for violent crime in the country, and is ranked as the 26th-worst urban jurisdiction for crime in Canada, (down from 15th in 2018), Lethbridge did see an overall increase in crime of about 2.23 per cent in 2019 compared to 2018.\n\nShare this story:\n\n16\n-15\n\nComments are closed.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n Facebook\n Twitter\n\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nSubscription Services\nArchive\nAbout Us\nThe Lethbridge Herald\nOther Publications\nContact\nCareers\nContact the Lethbridge Herald\n\n504 - 7th Street South\nLethbridge, AB T1J 3Z7\n\n[P] (403) 328-4411\n[F] (403)328-4536\n\nPrint Advertising: (403) 328-4410\nNational Advertising: (403) 380-7581\nOnline Advertising: (403)380-7581\nClassifieds: (403) 328-4433\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2024 The Lethbridge Herald\nAdvertisingTerms and Conditions & Privacy Policy\n\n"},

Firstly, she is a Gouchie, which is synonymous with Lhiedli T'enneh First Nations artistry and leadership. Secondly, she has another name and it is emblazoned on her brand new album Northern Shining Star Woman.\nFrank Peebles\nApr 26, 2017 10:50 PM\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nKym Gouchie poses for a photo on April 19.Brent Braaten, Photographer\n\nKym Gouchie has a name to live up to.\n\nFirstly, she is a Gouchie, which is synonymous with Lhiedli T'enneh First Nations artistry and leadership.\n\nSecondly, she has another name and it is emblazoned on her brand new album Northern Shining Star Woman. It's who she is, in title and in deed.\n\n\"That name was given to me at a sweat lodge ceremony about 20 years ago,\" said the singer-songwriter-activist who splits her time between birth territory Prince George and adopted second home Penticton.\n\n\"Lee Claremont is a Mohawk artist and she did a painting called At One With the Universe that she told me was done with me in mind, so I knew a long time ago that I wanted that painting and that name to be the basis of an album. It's finally done.\"\n\nGouchie has a knack for attracting musicians to collaborate with her, producers to agonize over the details of her recordings, and painters to lay brush on canvas in her likeness. This past weekend she was in Vancouver playing a concert at the Wise Hall as the headliner alongside Prince George's Naomi Kavka, with Joey Only from Wells also on the bill, and other acts as well.\n\nThe new record is also a collection of interior B.C. power-players.\n\nThe mastering was done by famed mix-finisher Greg Reely (Sarah McLachlan, Coldplay, Skinny Puppy, Fear Factory, Juno Award nominee for his work with Spirit Of The West) who now operates out of nearby Osoyoos.\n\nThe main producer was Thurein Myint who runs Ellis Avenue Analogue Studio out of Summerland. This is not the first time Myint and Gouchie have put their musical heads together. She loves his new-age musical views that boil down to his strictly old-school form of recording. Gouchie is a living symbol of the ancient cultural roots of Western Canada, and she is from a generational musical dynasty in Lhiedli T'enneh territory, so it might not be surprising to learn she was attracted to the magnetic warmth of mylar recording tools.\n\n\"It wasn't that way at all, actually,\" she said. She was in the flow of digital recording conditions. \"How it happened was, I was approached to start a band. I knew about Thurein because he was teaching my daughter (Shayna Desjarlais, who joined in on some of the recording sessions) guitar lessons and I knew he was just wonderful on guitar. I just wanted him to be the guitar player in this band. He said yes.\"\n\nThe band never really took off, but Gouchie and Myint now had a working relationship, and all her recording plans shifted to his studio and his production mind.\n\n\"We work so well together,\" she said. \"He'd take things so far above and beyond my expectations, way more than anything I was used to from a producer. A lot of the success of the sound was all to do with him.\n\n\"And having Greg just an hour down the road was the beauty of it. Thurein could drive him the tapes and preserve that analogue process right up to the final point of transferring it to CDs.\"\n\nOne track on the album, the final song in the sequence entitled Cleansing The Highway, was a collaboration of a wholly different sort. She is never shy about staring social issues in the eyes, with her performance art. She sings stories about residential school inspired by her family members' survival of systemic abuse. She has written about cancer, based on the many people in her life who have battled the disease and its resonant effects. She has written about domestic abuse, gleaned from the observations of life.\n\nCleansing The Highway also came from realities that splattered across her brain like wounds slashed across northern B.C. along the Highway Of Tears. The excruciatingly numerous cases of missing and murdered women in the region was her motivation for taking part in one of the commemorative walks of Highway 16 between Prince Rupert and Prince George. Along the road, she beat her hand drum and chanted.\n\nThose rhythms and vocal themes began to form into musical themes. She took it to local artist and hand-drummer Jennifer Pighin and her group The Khast'an Drummers for their compositional input. Brenda Wilson, mother of Highway Of Tears victim Ramona Wilson and an outspoken advocate for social reform, also consulted with Gouchie on the song.\n\nWhen CBC Radio program The Current came to Prince George to broadcast a special national forum on the issue of missing and murdered women, Gouchie was invited to perform the song in its form to that date. It ended up forming the closing sounds of the broadcast and it was noticed by Toronto listener Angela Rudden, the principal violist for the National Ballet of Canada Orchestra.\n\nRudden contacted Gouchie and offered a unique affiliation. With Gouchie's enthusiastic support, Rudden scored a string accompaniment for the Highway Of Tears song, recorded the parts in Ontario conducted by Eric Paetkau, and emailed the finished product to Gouchie.\n\nGouchie then took those bed recordings into the recording studio of CFUR with Fraser Hayes at the control board. She added vocals to cap off this journey of a composition.\n\n\"It was a cross-Canada collaboration, and it came from the earth,\" said Gouchie. \"When I listen to it, when I play it, I feel the presence of the missing and murdered and stolen women.\"\n\nGouchie also got to incorporate the ethereal past into this record. On the song I Am she got her grandmother Mary Gouchie to provide vocals in her Lheidli dialect of the Dakelh language.\n\n\"She is one of the few who speak it fluently, and I want to do something to bring it to light, keep the language alive,\" Gouchie said.\n\nAnd the song Waniska is also from the murky waters of time. It is a traditional Cree song, in honour of Gouchie's partially Cree heritage.\n\n\"We have never been able to pinpoint an origin other than it is traditional, and it means morning. It would be sung in the teepee villages to welcome the new day. I learned it a long, long time ago, and I just love it,\" Gouchie said.\n\nAn album release concert is in the works for Prince George, but dates have not been announced. The CD is available for download on Gouchie's website (www.kymgouchie.com) and for purchase at Exploration Place, Books & Company, Angelique's Native Arts, and Ave Maria. It is also in participating retailers along the highways of the region.\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nReport a mistake\nThis has not been shared.

Her body was dismembered and some of her parts were at the landfill and all over the banks of Calgary and they didn\u2019t find all her body. The guy that murdered her got away. He got so many years and now he\u2019s walking a free man.\u201d\n\nThe vigils take place in communities across Canada as well as internationally.\n\n\u201cThis is our 14th annual,\u201d said Amanda Scout, a Sisters In Spirit Vigil planning committee member.\n\n\u201cWe are honouring the missing and murdered Indigenous women and reminding people to keep that in mind that there have been inquiries and recommendations, but after that, no action.\u201d\n\nScout is also on the Reconciliation Committee and has worked with the City of Lethbridge.\n\n\u201cWe have gone through the recommendations thoroughly and we\u2019ve brought them to city council. There are 25 we feel that the City of Lethbridge can act on. It\u2019s just about creating safe spaces and getting the resources for women who might be at risk.\u201d\n\nScout said she believes the word is getting out.\n\n\u201cOf course, it could always be better and we would like to see more action. But it\u2019s being addressed and we have groups here in the city that are working with vulnerable women and trying to empower them. We\u2019re very hopeful and we\u2019ll keep walking.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday night en route to Galt Gardens from city hall vigil attendants held signs aloft proclaiming \u201cNo more stolen sisters\u201d\u2008and \u201cMissing, but not forgotten.\u201d\n\nMore speakers followed at Galt Gardens complete with a candlelight vigil that lit up the stage area as night fell.\n\nIt was a particularly busy weekend for English\u2019s family, who were also part of a walk from the Piikani Nation to Calgary to raise further awareness.\n\nThe walk started on Thursday.\n\n\u201cMy niece spearheaded it, it was her daughter that was brutally killed in Calgary,\u201d\u2008said English. \u201cWe walked from there to Nanton and they slept overnight and the next night they walked all the way to Calgary and to downtown Calgary.\u201d\n\nThe Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls inquiry was a 1,200-page report and also 230 calls to action for the police and institutions to be educated more on Indigenous people, their cultures, values, spirituality and beliefs, said English.\u00a0\n\n\u201cPart of the Missing and Murdered and the Truth in Reconciliation is for us to start reconciling with each other and start working together, be accepting of each other and live peacefully and prosper with each other and start loving each other for who we are. We\u2019re all human beings and we can\u2019t treat other nationalities as animals. We\u2019re human and we all want to be treated human and equally. Indigenous women have been treated brutally and abused. It\u2019s been going on and we want to make awareness to stop it. We want to be heard and we want people to know what\u2019s happening and to work with us as a community.\u201d\n\nFollow @DWoodardHerald on Twitter\n\nShare this story:\n\n23\n-22\n1 COMMENT\nOldest \newingbt\n 3 years ago\n\nI stand with you as you suffer from your losses and hope this evil shall cease stealing your people from you.\nI do understand you have your cultures, your values and spirituality and beliefs as may cultures do, but you must look at some of the reasons you have high rates of domestic violence, violent crimes, addictions and suicides. Your culture is colliding with the cultures of most of the world, as you move into non-FN communities. Many young on FN communities end up being brought up by aunties, grandmas or grandparents if they are lucky to have someone take them. The homes in your commmunities have been devasted, the family units. A strong community and people starts in the home!\nWe cannot help you do that . . . we understand your plight, but you and your communities need to make those changes.\nYour communities have zero tolerance with young doing drugs, committing crimes and roaming the streets aimlessly, that put them at risk.

The day is especially important for Marilyn Contois, a technician and Indigenous services worker at the library, as she almost feel victim herself.\n\n\u201cWhat happened here today, wouldn\u2019t have happened maybe 20 years ago, and (things are) taking time, two steps forward, one step back sometimes,\u201d said Contois.\n\n\u201cI was approached when I was seven years old and I could've went missing along the Highway of Tears, but thank God that my Grade 3 teacher taught us kids, they really did a good job about teaching us about strangers,\u201d she said.\n\nContois said she was excited to bring events to the library to mark the day, which included a round dance, honour song and different events throughout the week.\n\nArtist Debbie Kelman taught a beading class, while also having her painting called \u2018Her Hands: a tribute to Anna Mae Pictou Aquash' symbolizing the red dress hung in the library.\n\n\u201cAfter I did the painting, I stood back and I looked at it and I knew once I seen it that now I have to make the dress. And, so it was very powerful, spiritual experience making the dress,\u201d said Kelman.\n\nThe dresses are empty to representing the women and girls who should be wearing them.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly known how many Indigenous females have been murdered or have disappeared, but the Native Women's Association of Canada believes it's at least 4,000.\n\nKelman says her grandmother always told her to think of everyone as equal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all equal no matter what the situation in our life is, we\u2019re all equal and that everybody has human dignity and for everyone to treat every person with human dignity,\u201d said Kelman.\n\nThose in attendance on Thursday say the event should be more than just one day.\n\n\u201cEveryday could a be a day that we remember the murdered and missing Indigenous women and two spirit as well as men and also being an ally,\u201d said Contois.\n\nReport an error\nEditorial standards & policies\nWhy you can trust CTV News\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nMUST WATCH\n\nPet chicken from B.C. is now a Guinness World Record holder\n\nOnt. woman says black widow spider was inside bag of grapes\n\nThis Calgary man is trying to climb 21 mountains in 21 days\n\nCarjacking suspect swerves into traffic in police chase\n\nVibrant cascade of lava spews from Italy's Mount Etna\n\n'Oh my god!': Shocking brawl on a golf course in B.C.\n\nCalgary man wins massive $66M Lotto 6-49 jackpot\n\nToronto traffic so bad Niall Horan walks to his show\n\nWATCH: Ohio officer goes on hunt to find formula for newborn\n\nHow a MLB shortstop ended up with a top hit on iTunes\n\nRescuers searching for entangled whale near Vancouver Island\n\nCALGARY TOP STORIES\nNEW | Calgary no longer under state of local emergency, outdoor water restrictions remain\n'Incredibly concerning': Calgary taekwondo instructor facing child pornography charges\nNew E. coli infection discovered at Calgary preschool\nFormer Eau Claire YMCA building to reopen as athletic club with Nordic spa\nNEW | Calgary\u2019s Caribbean community pleads for support as Hurricane Beryl causes widespread damage\n10 things to do in Calgary this weekend (July 5-7)\nFirst Flip breakfast unofficially kicks off Calgary Stampede season\nPickup truck driver seriously injured in southern Alberta crash\nTOP VIDEOS\n\nPancake flipping at Calgary Stampede breakfast\n\nFive things you need to know for July 4, 2024\n\nMore thunderstorms possible\n\nFinal preparations for Stampede underway\n\nOutdoor water restrictions still in place\n\n$66M lottery winner in Calgary\n\nCalgary 'Blue Sky City' logo revealed\n\nClimbing 21 mountains in 21 days\n\nExtended: Calgary water main update, July 3\n\nGin Blossoms playing Roundup Music Festival\n\nWater restrictions set to come down\n\nFive things you need to know for July 3, 2024\n\nSunny weather expected for parade day\n\nFast-moving storm brings rain, hail to Calgary\n\nTeen driver in fatal crash sentenced to probation\n\nCTVNEWS.CA TOP STORIES\nTrying to sell or buy a home this summer?

On the National Day of Action for the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, Trans, and Two Spirited people (MMIWG2S), families and activists urged the federal government and Manitoba\u2019s government to search the landfill believed to be the site of unmarked graves of Indigenous women. Urban Indigenous leaders are calling for the city to make room for spaces that allow for healing to happen. They want the city to remove statues like the Queen Victoria statue in Gore Park, they feel are stark reminders of Canada\u2019s long history of colonialism.

But its affects everybody \u2013 the whole community,\u201d says Waskewitch.\n\nFriday\u2019s event will begin with Pipe Ceremony at 10 a.m. at the centre, then a memorial walk at noon from city hall to the clock tower and back to the centre. A lunch will be served from 1 p.m. and several speakers will be sharing. The Prairie Thunder Boys drummers from the public school division will also be on hand over the luncheon session.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWaskewitch who is marking her second year at the helm of the centre for Red Dress Day, explains the day\u2019s significance.\n\n\u201cRed Dress Day \u2013 it means a lot to a lot of women, moms, daughters and sisters.

The fire was not caused by her husband, but still an act of violence.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m stepping up,\u201d she says.\n\nNancy Chalifoux works for Driftpile First Nation and organized the Sisters in Spirit Walk, the first held in the community. She contacted the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women organization and they sent her a package to prepare for the walk.\n\nIn addition, 13 red dresses were hung in the Driftpile Community Hall. She explains one red dress represents 100 reported cases but she added another to represent the many more not reported.\n\n\u201cThe government says there are 1,200 [cases] but we know it\u2019s more than that.\u201d\n\nRed is the chosen colour to represent the walk and the cause.\n\nWhen she addressed the 100 attending before the walk, she urged all parties to \u201cbreak the violence\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope [this walk] continues each Oct. 4,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must never forget.\n\n\u201cWe have families here who need our support. We need to honour and support the families each and every day of the year.\n\n\u201cWe need to grieve and heal,\u201d she concluded.\n\nShe then went into details of her mother\u2019s death. Despite the death occurring in 2001, no investigation took place until 2017.\n\n\u201cThere was blood in her truck. Her wallet was discovered in a shed in this community. Thankfully, [Lesser Slave Regional Police Service] took up the investigation. No one has ever been charged.\u201d\n\nCharmaine Larsen spoke, fresh off a 16,000 km motorcycle ride to bring awareness to the issue.\n\n\u201cNo more stolen sisters,\u201d she said.\n\nAvis Giroux\u2019s sister lost her son, Rupert, in a distracted driving accident.\n\n\u201cAn innocent child,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken a long time for his mother to come back from this trauma.\u201d\n\nGuest speaker Henry Watchmaker spoke and offered words of comfort.\n\n\u201cYou can never kill the spirit when a life ends,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep on living, keep on surviving.\u201d\n\nNancy Chalifoux holds up a sign of her late mother, who passed away in 2001.\nThe Driftpile Cree Singers sang songs before the walk. Left-right are Willis Isadore, J.R. Coleman, Laurent Isadore and Elder George Isadore.\nNahachick remembered in Peace River\n\nPeace River celebrated its 17th annual Sisters in Spirit Walk Oct. 4. Above, a closing round dance highlighted the walk. Peace River Mayor Tom Tarpey spoke at the event, while Northern Sunrise County Reeve Carolyn Kolebaba and deputy reeve Norm Duval attended. Melissa Cardinal spoke on behalf of her sister Brittany about Jordan Nahachik, who went missing from Peace River last December. Men are now being included in the Sisters in Spirit ceremonies.\n\nUnited front shown in High Prairie\nRed hands are \u201cpainted\u201d over Lisa Roberts, left, and Lennon Cardinal. The red hands signify a hand being over the mouth so the victim cannot speak. Roberts lost her mother, Evelyn Roberts, in 1978. The case remains unsolved.\n\nChris Clegg\nSouth Peace News\n\nOn such a sad and somber occasion, Belinda Willier could not have been more pleased.\n\nWillier literally gushed with pride about how the Sisters in Spirit movement has grown locally since the High Prairie Friendship Centre started the first walk 11 years ago.\n\n\u201cWe are growing,\u201d she says. \u201cThe word is spreading!\u201d\n\nThe first walks attracted less than a dozen people. Well over 50 attended the High Prairie walk, over 150 in Kinuso and 100 in Driftpile. Other walks were held in Peace River, Slave Lake and Valleyview. Another is planned for Peavine.\n\nThe Sisters in Spirit Walks bring awareness to missing and murdered Indigenous women.\n\n\u201cAs part of our commitment to the issue and to the countless families who are still in need of justice, the Native Wowen\u2019s Association of Canada is a lead organizer in the Sisters in Spirit vigils,\u201d says Willier.\n\n\u201cWe gather to honor our lost sisters and their families.\n\n\u201cWe gather to show we are a united front.\n\n\u201cWe gather to shed light on a crisis that affects every Canadian and we gather to pressure all levels of government to act and act now!\u201d\n\nA video was shown highlighting the loss of local Indigenous women including Brenda Moreside, Agnes Rose Chalifoux, Carmen L\u2019Hirondelle, Angeline Willier, Nina Joseph and Jackie Murdock. It is updated each year.\n\nWillier reminds everyone that the Sucker Creek Women\u2019s Shelter offers a safe and supportive environment for battered women and their children, women in crisis, or other women in need of emergency accommodations.\n\nSchools lead the walk at Kinuso\nDrummers lead the Sisters in Spirit Walk at Kinuso on Oct. 4. Students from Swan River First Nation School and Kinsuo School [Grades 7-10] participated.\n\nPearl Lorentzen\nFor South Peace News\n\nRiver of Silence writer Petie Chalifoux was part of the Sisters in Spirit event held by Swan River and Kinuso Schools.\n\nChalifoux\u2019s grandmother is one of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in Canada. Petie\u2019s grandmother\u2019s case is unsolved, but has been reopened.\n\nPetie is a film writer, hoop dancer and Swan River First Nations School graduate. She wrote Rivers of Silence, which is a film about a family\u2019s search for their missing daughter.\n\nThe film was shot in 2016. The world premiere of the film was at the 2018 Skins Film Festival in Los Angeles. The film hasn\u2019t been released widely in Canada. Stan Isadore from Driftpile First Nation is one of the main actors.\n\nStudents in Kinuso walked from the Kinuso School to the Swan River School at 11 a.m. Oct. 4, to raise awareness about Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women. The event was organized by Swan River and Kinuso Schools.\n\nDrummers drummed the whole walk and did an honour song while Petie performed a hoop dance.\n\nNancy Chalifoux, Petie\u2019s mother, spoke about her mother\u2019s murder. The message was to look out for each other and the hope that this never happens to anyone else.\n\nLunch was served at Swan River School and the school showed River of Silence.\n\nAround 150 people attended, including all of the Swan River students and Grades 7-10 from Kinuso School.\n\n\u00a0This informed me50%\u00a0This not needed50%\nFiled in: Events, News\nTags: featured\nShare this post\nTWITTER\nFACEBOOK\nGOOGLE+\nLINKEDIN\nPINTEREST\nEMAIL\nRecommended for You\nGirouxville Museum opens for season\nConcert series continues July 3 at 12-Foot Davis\nGrand opening of Grimshaw Splash Park\nBig Lakes County hosts annual barbecue\nPost Comment\n\nComment *\n\nName * \n\nEmail * \n\nWebsite \n\nHIGH PRAIRIE - PEACE RIVER\n23\u00b0\nfew clouds\n56% humidity\nwind: 6m/s WSW\nH 23 \u2022 L 23\n23\u00b0\nFRI\n24\u00b0\nSAT\n27\u00b0\nSUN\n28\u00b0\nMON\n29\u00b0\nTUE\n31\u00b0\nWED\n28\u00b0\nTHU\n25\u00b0\nFRI\n24\u00b0\nSAT\n24\u00b0\nSUN\n\n Environment Canada Forecast \n\n Alberta 511 Road Reports \n\n Alberta Wildfire Status Map \n\nRecent Comments\nPeter Milne on\nDifferent rules for different councillors?

PHOTO BY LIAM RICHARDS /Saskatoon StarPhoenix\nArticle content\n\nI have a beef with Saskatoon Transit.\u00a0Don\u2019t get me wrong. I love the public transport system. But not its slightly errant ways.\n\nHaving lived my entire life in massive Indian cities with a population upward of a million, I am used to decent public transport. In comparison, Saskatoon, where the population crossed 300,000 last year, is an outlier.\n\nEven then, one of the first things I noticed after arriving this winter was the good transit layout and network here.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nTRENDING\nCity of Saskatoon announces new high-level executive\n'He was my best friend': Father remembers son killed in alleged impaired hit-and-run\nWoman charged after altercation on city bus in Saskatoon's Confederation Park neighbourhood\nMandryk: Sask. Party has turned truth telling into an election issue\nPolice investigating two stabbings in Saskatoon in two days\nArticle content\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not all rosy. Otherwise, transit would have clocked way more than 4.89 million \u201celectronic\u201d rides in 2022, the last year for which the annual report has been published.\n\nI live in Stonebridge, and the best bus to take me downtown, for instance, is number 83. Never mind the weather outside, it\u2019s a glide once you are in \u2014 40 minutes and you are ready to disembark.\u00a0If you get the bus, that is.\n\nIt arrives every half an hour, which is fine. But it does not run after 6.30 p.m., which is not fine. And not on weekends, which is anything but fine.\n\nTake this Saturday. I had to go downtown for a volunteer shift. You guessed it \u2014 there was no 83. The option? Walk 25 minutes or so, get a different bus, and then a second one.\n\nTruth be told, it was a nice walk; the weather was great. But what about days with bad weather? Besides, how many others will make the effort, if they have a vehicle?\n\nAt the end of the day, it is a municipality\u2019s responsibility that more people take public transport. Especially in a country that takes \u2014 justifiable \u2014 pride in working on sustainability.\n\n\u201cThe government is taking action to help Canadians \u2026 adapt to the effects of climate change, and make life more affordable on the track to net-zero. We\u2019re building a Canada-wide network of charging stations \u2026 and investing in public transit, rail and ferries \u2026\u201d\n\nAfternoon Headlines\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThat\u2019s from the federal budget, announced last month.\n\nAlthough the budget has proposed a push for zero-emission electric vehicles and has \u201ccommitted more than $1 billion to build charging stations,\u201d it\u2019s going to take time. The government\u2019s own national target of 100 per cent zero-emission vehicles is 2035.\n\nAs population and demand increase in the intervening years, the world is bound to get foggier \u2014 I should know; I come from Delhi, where the sky is clouded by haze half the year.\n\nSo, yes, making the bus on Route 83 more frequent will keep the smog at bay for a tiny second more by offering people an option other than driving.\n\nOne argument often bandied around is Saskatoon\u2019s relatively small population and its harsh winter conditions. It\u2019s argued the money spent is just not worth the effort.\n\nMy concerns aside, as one of the fastest-growing Canadian cities, Saskatoon needs better transit for sure. Last year, the city added nearly 14,000 new residents, a large portion of that immigrants.\n\nBesides catering to internal migration from other provinces as housing costs head northward elsewhere, Saskatoon is also a university town, and will always have an influx of students \u2014 from within the province and outside, including international students.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nFrom all accounts, those annual numbers are unlikely to dive back to four figures in the near future. Most of them will be forced to get cars eventually, which will evidently lead to relatively more choked roads. Is the city road network and infrastructure ready to handle a few thousand vehicles more each year?\n\nOr \u2014 and I look back again at my India experience \u2014 are we looking at gridlocks, sooner rather than later?\n\nWhich brings us to the point about harsh winters. A valid point. But if European cities can do it, so can we. All we need are bus shelters \u2014 and lots of them \u2014 and increased frequency. The two main reasons that deter more people from using transit.\n\nShantanu Datta is a freelance writer and editor based in Saskatoon who previously worked with The Indian Express publications in New Delhi.\n\nRECOMMENDED FROM EDITORIAL\nPhil Tank: Saskatoon city council opts to save $1.5M a year ... maybe\nPhil Tank: Debate on Saskatoon cycling safety undergoes radical shift\n\nShare your views\n\nThe StarPhoenix welcomes opinion articles.

Commissioner Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue in a report last week called in foreign meddling a threat to Canadian democracy, and called for measures to tackle it.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely the foreign registry announced Monday will be in place for the next federal election in 2025, the government said.\n\nIsrael rejects ceasefire proposal accepted by Hamas as Rafah invasion looms\n\nIsrael appeared poised to launch a long-threatened invasion of Rafah in southern Gaza, against the urging of humanitarian aid groups and allies, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government rejected the terms of a ceasefire accepted by the Hamas leadership.\n\nVideos and photos show long lines of Palestinians departing the city that had previous been declared a safe zone after the Israeli military used text messages and leaflets to warn residents in eastern Rafah to leave the area.\n\nHours after Israel sent the evacuation warning, Ismail Haniyeh, the Qatar-based political leader of Hamas, said he had accepted a ceasefire brokered by Egypt and Qatar. Any deal would involve the release of some of the 100 hostages Hamas has been holding in Gaza since Oct. 7. Netanyahu\u2019s office said it would carry out the military operation in Rafah in parallel with negotiations.\n\nHumanitarian groups have reacted with alarm to the evacuation order. Meanwhile, families some of the Israeli hostages are calling on their government to explain why the ceasefire negotiations fell apart.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery:\n\nDisplaced Palestinians who fled Rafah after the Israeli military began evacuating civilians from the eastern parts of the southern Gazan city travel on a vehicle in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip on May 6, 2024.\nRAMADAN ABED/REUTERS\n\nManitoba man admits to killing four women, defence to argue he is not criminally responsible\n\nThe Winnipeg trial of a man accused of killing four First Nations women and dumping their bodies in a landfill will hinge on his mental state and the intention behind the killings.\n\nJeremy Skibicki\u2019s lawyers told a Manitoba superior court today that their client killed the women in 2022, and they intend to argue he was not criminally responsible because of mental illness. The defence\u2019s legal strategy means the trial will be heard in front of a judge alone, rather than a jury, when arguments get under way on Wednesday. The 12-person jury selected to hear the case will be dismissed.\n\nPolice have alleged that Skibicki is a serial killer who murdered 26-year-old Marcedes Myran, 39-year-old Morgan Harris, 24-year-old Rebecca Contois, and an unidentified woman whom Indigenous elders have named Mashkode Bizhiki\u2019ikwe, or Buffalo Woman. Skibicki was arrested in 2022 for the killings.\n\nThe development in the high-profile case comes a day after Red Dress Day, marked annually to bring awareness to the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada.\n\nFines mounting for violations in Canada\u2019s temporary foreign worker programs\n\nThe federal government set a record high for fines related to non-compliance with Canada\u2019s temporary foreign worker rules in 2023 \u2013 and this year is shaping up to be even worse, according to a Globe analysis of government figures.\n\nInfractions include wage theft and workplace abuse. Ottawa handed out $2.7-million in penalties against non-compliant employers last year, with an average fine of $13,800 per decision.\n\nSo far in 2024, the average fine is nearly $29,000, according to data reviewed by The Globe as of late April. That\u2019s significantly higher than the roughly $3,200 average fine from 2019.\n\nCanadian companies have been hiring temporary foreign workers in greater numbers in recent years, aided by policy changes aimed at addressing labour shortages. But the trend has sparked concerns about the potential for worker exploitation.\n\nALSO ON OUR RADAR\n\nCampus protests: Columbia University is cancelling its main graduation ceremony after weeks of protests over the war in Gaza. The Ivy League school, one of several postsecondary campuses across Canada and the United States where pro-Palestinian protests have popped up, says it will hold smaller, school-based graduation events. Meanwhile, Ontario\u2019s premier says universities should start clearing protest encampments.\n\nGovernment procurement: Ottawa went years without launching after-the-fact audits of companies that received contracts from an Indigenous procurement program.\n\nMining: Panama elected a pro-business president over the weekend and the outcome is raising hopes for Canadian mining company First Quantum. The company\u2019s financial situation has deteriorated after its Cobre Panama copper mine \u2013 which used to account for half its revenue \u2013 was ordered closed by the country\u2019s departing president last year.\n\nFish farms: Canada\u2019s Public Sector Integrity Commissioner is launching an investigation into allegations that federal fisheries officials tried to silence scientists who were researching environmental threats related to open-net fish farms in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nKeffiyeh ban: The Speaker of the Ontario legislature has partially eased a ban on the keffiyeh, allowing it to be worn inside Queen\u2019s Park, but not in the legislative chamber. The Speaker banned the checkered scarf this year, arguing it is being worn to make a political statement about the Israel-Gaza war. Independent member Sarah Jama was asked to leave Question Period today after putting on the scarf inside the chamber.\n\nMARKET WATCH\n\nNorth American stock markets rise on renewed U.S. rate cut bets\n\nMarkets in Canada and the U.S. closed higher on Monday on fresh hopes of a potential U.S. rate cut.\n\nCanada\u2019s main stock index closed its highest in over three weeks, boosted by energy stocks and renewed bets from investors on U.S. rate cuts some time this year.\n\nU.S. stock indexes also ended higher on their third straight session of advances, though they underperformed the S&P/TSX composite index, which closed up 312.06 points, or 1.42 per cent, at 22,259.47.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 176.59 points or 0.46 per cent to 38,852.27, the S&P 500 gained 52.95 points or 1.03 per cent to 5,180.74 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 192.92 points or 1.19 per cent to 16,349.25.\n\nThe Canadian dollar was trading at 73.18 US cents.\n\nGot a news tip that you\u2019d like us to look into?

It\u2019s about who can race to the bottom fastest.\u201d - Adrian Lee\n\nOntario\u2019s keffiyeh ban dares to define the scarf\u2019s meaning for everyone\n\n\u201cAsking a Palestinian to remove the keffiyeh is like asking a Muslim woman to remove her hijab or an Indigenous person to remove their headdress. It is an article of clothing deeply embedded with one\u2019s culture and identity.\u201d - Sheema Khan\n\nPutting migrants in federal prisons is unjustified and unjust\n\n\u201cRather than using more humane (and less expensive) alternatives to detention that allow for people to live in the community, the CBSA opted to detain thousands of migrants, even though every year, the agency monitors thousands of people in the community, and it is rare that any of them abscond.\u201d - Lloyd Axworthy and Allan Rock\n\nIn Canada, we bank where we buy\n\n\u201cParticipating in slick marketing programs that allow you to engage in lite banking activity seems contradictory and foolish. It\u2019s a little bit silly, just like Canadian Tire money was.\u201d - Vass Bednar\n\nUkraine\u2019s push to conscript men abroad won\u2019t do much to win the war\n\n\u201cUkrainians living abroad who are opposed to fighting are unlikely to be lured back, in particular those who were already in other countries before the war started and children who are coming of age abroad. Instead, many may choose to cut ties with Ukraine entirely.\u201d - Lidiia Karpenko\n\nLIVING BETTER\n\nNeed more fibre? Add these six high-fibre foods to your diet\n\nOpen this photo in gallery:\n\nThere are two types of fibre: soluble and insoluble. Both are present in varying proportions in different foods, but some foods can be rich in one or the other.\nTED JOHNS/GETTY IMAGES/ISTOCKPHOTO\n\nFibre is an oft overlooked nutrient that comes with a whole host of health benefits. A diet high in fibre is associated with a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer, breast cancer and diverticulitis. Research suggests that eating fibre-rich food can help you live a longer life in good health.

Canada followed suit a week later, with a war proclamation from Ottawa that appeared in the Sept. 11 Globe.\nTHE GLOBE AND MAIL\n\nIn the Second World War, the first global war of a truly mass-media era, The Globe and Mail took some of the first steps in defying the federal government\u2019s censorship machinery.

Yet despite the heightened vulnerability of indigenous females to often lethal violence when safe public transportation is not available, Wyant and his cabinet peers have failed to learn the painful lessons taught out in British Columbia along a stretch of northern road known as the Highway of Tears.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nTRENDING\nFive concert events to see in Saskatoon in July\n'He was my best friend': Father remembers son killed in alleged impaired hit-and-run\nCity of Saskatoon announces new high-level executive\n'Significant, widespread' rain drenched Sask. farms: crop report\nVictim impact statements expected at Gregory Fertuck sentencing hearing\nArticle content\n\nThe lack of bus service along its nearly 800 kilometres has meant that hitchhiking is sometimes the only way for those who live along it to get around. At least 18 females, mostly indigenous, have gone missing or turned up dead along the highway since 1970. Still, it took nearly 10 long years of activism by indigenous people and allies to get the B.C. and federal governments to work together to institute bus service.\n\nB.C. Liberal Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation Minister John Rustad announced that 30 kilometres of the highway would have service six days a week starting Jan. 30, 2017. He added that work is underway to set up more comprehensive service before summer\u2019s end.\n\nWhen STC is shut down at month\u2019s end, how long will it be before this province has its own Highway of Tears? How many will have to go missing or be found dead before the Wall government learns what its B.C. counterpart finally did?\n\nSusan Gingell\n\nSaskatoon\n\nSHARE YOUR VIEWS\n\nThe StarPhoenix welcomes letters, which are limited to 250 words and must include the writer\u2019s name, street address and phone number.\n\nSubmissions will be verified and edited before publication.\nWe publish the names and community of all letter writers.\nDo not send email attachments.\nWriting more than one letter a month is discouraged and \u201copen\u201d letters are not accepted.\n\nSend to: 204 Fifth Ave. N., Saskatoon, Sask., S7K 2P1\n\nFax: 306-657-6437\n\nEmail: letters@thestarphoenix.com\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nHeart Surgeon Shares 3 Min Routine For Daily Bowel Movements\nGundry MD\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nThree arrested after drug trafficking investigation in Saskatoon\nSaskatoon StarPhoenix\nLawyer for trucker who caused deadly Broncos crash says families have no right to sue\nSaskatoon StarPhoenix\nSeniors Are Getting Free Hearing Tests (Here's how)\nConnect Hearing\n|\nSponsored\nStudent Discovers Genius Device to Wipe Out Mosquitoes Instantly\nTop Review Picks\n|\nSponsored\nCanadians In Alberta With No Life Insurance Are Taking Advantage Of This\nCovered For Life\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nOne Teaspoon Every Night Burns Body Fat Like Never Before, You Will Fit In Your Pants Again!\nBurn Belly Fat\n|\nSponsored\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\n\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

Diesel-fired plants can respond rapidly to shifting demand and have also proved dependable in harsh environments.\n\nBut diesel is unpopular because of its high emissions and the challenges with shipping it to far-flung places. The plants emit sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter \u2013 impairing local air quality \u2013 along with greenhouse gases. Leaks and accidental spills occur frequently.\n\nThis nuclear project wants to offer a greener option \u2013 but first it has to assuage safety and cost concerns and compete with renewables.\n\nWestinghouse, a U.S.-based reactor vendor, has partnered with Prodigy Clean Energy, a Montreal-based company, to develop a transportable nuclear power plant. They market it as a solution for delivering small modular reactors (SMRs) for coastal applications. Prodigy\u2019s plant promises to address many of diesel\u2019s shortcomings \u2013 emissions, in particular \u2013 while replicating its desirable features.\n\nIn March, Prodigy announced it had reached an agreement with Des N\u00ebdh\u00e9 Group, a development corporation of the English River First Nation in northern Saskatchewan. Des N\u00ebdh\u00e9's task will be to engage with First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis across Canada on potential installations.\n\nBut even as Prodigy moves ahead, many questions remain.\n\nFor example, SMRs are often marketed as producers of clean energy, but this overlooks their radioactive wastes: Being saddled with a floating radiological hazard on its shoreline could be a worst-case scenario for a Northern community. If radioactive waste did become stranded in the North, or a serious accident occurred, who would be responsible?\n\nAlso, there are still no cost estimates available. How would a community afford one of the most expensive options for generating power? How would they manage security of the plant? How far can renewables even can go in replacing diesel?\n\nAs the two nuclear partners race to commercialize their transportable nuclear plant, a few Northern communities are already using renewables such as wind and solar to reduce diesel consumption. Will floating nuclear power plants be ready in time, or is it just a nuclear energy fairy tale?\n\nOpen this photo in gallery:\n\nAn illustration of a Transportable Nuclear Power Plant deployed in a protected harbour in an Arctic setting.

(Logan Lehmann/paNOW Staff)\nBy Derek Craddock\nMMIWG\nSask. advocates hope proposed Red Dress Alert becomes reality\nApr 11, 2024 | 5:00 PM\n\n\n\nIt could mean the difference between life and death for Indigenous women across Canada and advocates in Saskatchewan are praying it happens.\n\nLast week, a Manitoba MP called for the creation of an Alert System for missing Indigenous women known as the Red Dress Alerts. The system would follow the same model as the Amber Alerts which are sent out for children who are missing and deemed at risk.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical initiative,\u201d New Democrat MP Leah Gazan, who represents the riding of Winnipeg Centre, said last month as a House of Commons committee began studying her \u201cRed Dress Alert\u201d proposal.\n\n\u201cThis is an initiative that will save lives.\u201d\n\nGazan\u2019s fellow MPs unanimously backed her motion last year declaring the deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls a Canada-wide emergency. The motion also called for funding for a new alert system similar to those that exist for missing children and seniors.\n\nNow, MPs are discussing with experts and stakeholders about how to implement such a system across the country.\n\nIt\u2019s an initiative that\u2019s long overdue according to Lori Campbell, the Associate Vice-President of Indigenous Engagement at the University of Regina.\n\nThe member of Montreal Lake Cree Nation said Indigenous women have, historically and currently, been mistreated and undervalued across the country and hopes the discussions around the Red Dress Alert system to change that narrative.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen with the Amber Alerts that 80 per cent of the children that have gone out through the Amber Alert have been located,\u201d she said. \u201cThe longer it takes to get the information out there, the more challenging and unlikely it is that we\u2019ll be able to locate them and bring them home safely.\u201d\n\nA 2019 report from a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls found deliberate rights violations at the heart of violence against Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse people.\n\nWith the final report came 231 calls to justice directed toward governments, social service providers, industry and Canadians, but relatively little progress has been made to-date \u2014 particularly on the federal side.\n\nMichelle LeClair, the Vice-President of the Metis Nation Saskatchewan (MN-S) said governments have not been taking those Calls to Action seriously.\n\n\u201cI think the alert system is great, but it also adds to the conversation that needs to be had again and again and that\u2019s about the safety of our Indigenous women,\u201d she said. \u201cThe general citizen needs to be concerned about the number of women that go missing, the number of our women that are being murdered and we\u2019re not really addressing it in a meaningful way.\u201d\n\nBetween 2009 and 2021, the homicide rate among Indigenous women and girls was six times higher than for their non-Indigenous counterparts, Statistics Canada concluded in a report released last year.\n\nThat report also found that homicides involving Indigenous women and girls are less likely to result in the most serious murder charges than cases in which victims were non-Indigenous.\n\nAnother Saskatchewan advocate in favour of the Red Dress Alert system is Krista Fox from North Battleford.\n\n\u201cThis is something I have been pushing for for years,\u201d she said in a statement to paNOW. \u201cI am a huge MMIP (Missing and Murdered Indigenous Peoples) advocate and have voiced my concerns over an alert for some time.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, Fox walked across Canada to raise awareness of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG).\n\nFox walked to draw attention to the crisis of all MMIW in Canada and to raise awareness of missing North Battleford woman Ashley Morin, who disappeared in July of 2018. RCMP believe Morin, a 31-year-old woman from Ahtahkakoop Cree Nation, was the victim of a homicide.\n\nOther North American jurisdictions already have similar alert systems, including Washington state\u2019s \u201cMissing Indigenous Person\u201d system, which coexists with the existing Amber Alert and Silver Alert programs.\n\nIn Canada, there are alert systems for individual First Nations including the James Smith Cree Nation which launched its system earlier this year.\n\nThe new feature is on the Talking Stick app, which is an anonymous chat app developed by the company in partnership with the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN).\n\nThe app is designed to allow First Nations leaders to issue emergency alerts about missing persons, public safety emergencies, or natural disasters.\n\nThe Union of Nova Scotia Mi\u2019kmaq has a similar system for its member First Nations while Aboriginal Alert, a website providing details on missing Indigenous peoples, has existed for some time. As of early March, the website has more than 340 Indigenous women, girls, boys and men reported missing, with a large number in the prairies.\n\n(Credit/Aboriginal Alert)\n\nWhile the Metis Nation does not have its own system, LeClair noted that once a citizen goes missing, information is quickly posted on social media and shared by thousands of people.\n\nWhile the news of the potential alert system is good for Campbell, she wants to make sure it is done correctly.\n\n\u201cGood intentions sometimes can cause unintentional harm and I think this is another instance where we also need to ensure that it\u2019s Indigenous-led so that Indigenous people feel confident in it and feel like it is a positive resource for them because we haven\u2019t had a lot of trust and historically there\u2019s reasons for that.\u201d\n\nLeClair added that the Red Dress Alert should follow the same criteria as the Amber Alert which is issued if a child is deemed to be in grave danger, something she said every Indigenous woman faces.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always in grave danger because of just being Indigenous and I\u2019m really hopeful that if we do have an alert system, that it\u2019s done in a meaningful, impactful way,\u201d she said.\n\nGazan\u2019s Red Dress Alert proposal is being examined by the House of Commons Status of Women committee, which has already heard testimony from several experts calling for the initiative to be Indigenous-led.\n\nSuch a model, they say, would mitigate the problem of police inaction, as well as bureaucratic red tape, to better ensure members of the public are notified of a disappearance promptly and efficiently.\n\n-With files from Angela Brown and The Canadian Press\n\nby Derek Craddock\nAround the Web\nAlberta Residents Born Before 1984 With No Life Insurance Can Get a $250,000\nDollarGuardian\nWrinkles Around the Mouth?

to launch an alert system that would inform the public when an Indigenous woman or girl goes missing, they announced Friday in Winnipeg, ahead of a national day to mark the crisis.\n\nThe long-awaited Red Dress Alert system is a bid to prevent deaths and increase safe reunions with loved ones.\n\nStatistics Canada concluded in a report last year that the homicide rate for Indigenous women and girls was six times higher than the rate for their non-Indigenous counterparts.\n\nA national inquiry concluded five years ago that they are 12 times more likely to go missing or murdered.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic moment, and a major step toward ending the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse peoples,\u201d said NDP MP Leah Gazan, who has lead federal advocacy on the alert.\n\n\u201cAnd while we celebrate this historic moment, it is critical to remember that we are not done until a Red Dress Alert is no longer needed.\u201d\n\nThe Manitoba pilot is to be designed with and led by Indigenous Peoples, and is expected to help inform an eventual national alert system.\n\nIt will be funded through monies set aside in this year\u2019s federal and provincial budgets.\n\nNahanni Fontaine, Manitoba\u2019s Minister for Women and Gender Equity, said she has heard from community members who believe the alert system could help reduce risk for Indigenous women and girls.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working inclusively with Indigenous partners in Manitoba to find the best path forward as we build this pilot project.\u201d\n\nCrown-Indigenous Relations Minister Gary Anandasangaree said Winnipeg \u2013 and Manitoba writ large \u2013 is the epicentre of the crisis, and launching the Red Dress Alert there will bring forward solutions that can be implemented across the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the only solution, but it\u2019s a critical starting point for us to address the immediate crisis that exists.\u201d\n\nGazan\u2019s efforts on the file led a House of Commons committee to study the prospect for a national alert system.\n\nHer fellow MPs unanimously backed her motion in the House of Commons last year declaring the deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls a Canada-wide emergency.\n\nThe motion also called on the federal government to fund a new alert system that would operate much like Amber Alerts.\n\nOther North American jurisdictions already have similar alert systems, including Washington state\u2019s Missing Indigenous Person system.\n\nThe national inquiry\u2019s 2019 final report found deliberate rights violations were at the heart of violence against Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse people.\n\nWith the final report came 231 calls to justice directed toward governments, social service providers, industry and Canadians, but relatively little progress has been made to date.\n\nSheila North, former grand chief of Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak and an ex-journalist, has been a vocal advocate in ending violence against Indigenous women.\n\nShe said that while news of an alert system is welcome, she hopes expectations are kept reasonable \u2013 at least for now.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be bumps in the road \u2013 there\u2019s going to be challenges that maybe none of us see right now,\u201d she said. \u201cInevitably, someone is going to be disappointed.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s the starting point that matters, she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s high time.\u201d\n\nTo those who may not see the value in an alert system for Indigenous women, Ms. North said people of that identity have been shut out of many parts of society \u201cfor so long,\u201d and the deaths \u201care a result of it.\u201d\n\nThe House of Commons committee studying the alert has heard testimony from experts who stress any system should be Indigenous-led.\n\nThat\u2019s in part to mitigate the problems of police inaction and bureaucratic red tape, so that members of the public are notified of a disappearance promptly and efficiently.\n\nJennifer Jesty, who serves as the resiliency manager for the Union of Nova Scotia Mi\u2019kmaq, spoke to MPs about her own efforts to get an emergency alert system running for her communities and attempts to minimize police interference.\n\nSince September, 2020, Ms. Jesty told the committee in late March that she sent out 183 alerts and reunited 67 people with their families as a result \u2013 the vast majority of whom were brought back together with their families within an hour of the alert going out.\n\n\u201cBecause this system was designed by us, for us, we were able to create our own protocols around when, how and why an alert should or shouldn\u2019t be sent,\u201d Ms. Jesty said.\n\n\u201cThere has not been one single request for an alert that has been denied, and every single alert has been sent out within minutes of receiving the information.\u201d\n\nSign up for our

Leo at the Squamish Lil'wat Cultural Centre following the Sisters in Spirit Vigil in October 2018. File photo by Joel Barde\nListen to this article\n00:04:58\n\nLinda Epp hasn\u2019t lived in Whistler since 2021.\n\nThat trivial fact isn\u2019t stopping the activist from bringing the Sisters in Spirit Vigil back to the resort for the first time since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Epp founded the powerful event in 2015 to honour Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two-Spirited (MMIWG2S). That was one year before the federal government launched a national inquiry, formally acknowledging the dark reality First Nations communities had been calling attention to for decades: Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA people are murdered, abused, and disappear at shockingly high rates.\n\n\u201cThis is still happening,\u201d Epp said, even if \u201cthe world is now more aware of what Indigenous people in Canada have gone through.\u201d\n\nEpp is a member of the sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh (Sechelt) Nation, but was raised by a Canadian-German Mennonite family after she and her twin sister were separated from their birth parents during the Sixties Scoop. She landed in Whistler in 1997, where she stayed until the housing crisis and work opportunities prompted her return to Vancouver two-and-a-half years ago.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so attached to [Whistler\u2019s] community and the people\u2014the Lil\u2019wat and Squamish people, but the community members as well, and the allies,\u201d she said. \u201cI say Vancouver is my home city, but Whistler is my hometown \u2026 I\u2019ve done a lot of hard work in the past there, and I think I can still continue to do so. Even if I\u2019m in Vancouver, I think there\u2019s still powerful work to do in the Sea to Sky corridor.\u201d\n\nAs usual, Sisters in Spirit invites participants together on Oct. 4\u2014the National Day of Action for MMIWG2S\u2014to hear from individuals and families impacted by this epidemic, share in their heartache, and advocate for change.\n\nThis year, however, marks the first time Epp is expanding the event to take place over two days.\n\nThe Sisters in Spirit Vigil walk begins at 11 a.m. on Wednesday. All are invited to meet at the Welcome Totem Pole, in Whistler Village Common by Mongolie Grill and Shoppers Drug Mart, before journeying together down the Village Stroll. (Unless weather fails to cooperate, that is, in which case an indoor gathering at the Maury Young Arts Centre will replace the walk.)\n\nIt\u2019s a heavy topic, Epp acknowledged\u2014one she\u2019s tried to lighten in previous years by concluding the walk with uplifting singing and drumming. \u201cThis year, I want to do something even better,\u201d she said.\n\nSpecifically, Epp wanted to wrap up the sombre National Day of Action by shining light on Indigenous success. So, she reached out to some friends to join her.\n\nSisters in Spirit will continue Wednesday evening with a presentation and Q&A with Lorimer Shenher at the Maury Young Arts Centre from 7 to 8 p.m.\n\nThe author, speaker, and advocate was the first Vancouver Police Department detective assigned to investigate missing and murdered Indigenous women in Vancouver. He detailed his role in that investigation in That Lonely Section of Hell, an acclaimed memoir that also recounts his years-long struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his work on the case.\n\nWednesday\u2019s event continues with a Spirits Rising Drumming Session at 8:30 p.m., led by Epp alongside Bill Helin, the Tsimshian/Norwegian artist, author and children\u2019s educator who has visited classrooms to share his ancestors\u2019 teachings through story drumming since 1990. Their goal is \u201cto elevate the women to come out of the ground and fly high among the Eagles, and have the ancestors welcome them,\u201d Epp said.\n\nWith that in mind, the aptly-named Spirits Rising Fashion Show will follow on Thursday evening, Oct. 5. Locals and visitors are invited back to the Maury Young Arts Centre to celebrate the creativity of Himikalas Pamela Baker, a fashion designer who grew up on the Capilano Indian \u201cXwemelch\u2019stn\u201d reserve in West Vancouver and is known to take inspiration from her Squamish, Kwakiutl, Tlingit and Haida ancestry. Ten Indigenous models will take to the runway wearing 30 of Baker\u2019s breathtakingly-intricate contemporary Indigenous textile designs.\n\nDoors open at 6:30 p.m. before the show kicks off at 7 p.m. The event will conclude with a post-show reception and Q&A with the designer.\n\nIn the lead-up to next week\u2019s event, Epp travelled up the Sea to Sky highway to continue her tradition of hanging red dresses in a growing number of local businesses.\n\nA striking symbol of MMIWG2S, the dresses \u201cprovoke discussion,\u201d said Epp, \u201cand not just with the locals, but the people that are coming into the community and that are tourists. Because in the beginning, in reality, it was considered political.\u201d\n\nEntry to Wednesday evening\u2019s programming costs $5 per person, while tickets to Thursday\u2019s Spirits Rising Fashion Show are on sale for $10 each. Tickets are available for purchase at the Maury Young Arts Centre. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. on both Oct. 4 and 5. Wednesday morning\u2019s walk is free to attend.\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nLetter to the editor\nReport a mistake\nThis has been shared 2 times\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nMore Highlights\n\tWith heat wave looming, people are reminded not to leave animals locked in a vehicle\n\tNew toilet installation approved for campground on Texada Island\n\tArranged mortgages: How Canadian parents influence their children\u2019s housing choices\n\nCOMMUNITY POLL\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nAre you concerned with the compensation level of senior local government staffers?\n Yes\n No\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nTRENDING TODAY\n1\t\nUpdated: Injuries sustained in Highway 101 crash near Halfmoon Bay\n\n2\t\nSunshine Coast SAR responds to Canada Day callout to Smuggler Cove \n\n3\t\nSpy-hopping whales caught on camera in Porpoise Bay June 29 \n\n4\t\nOpinion: My promise to you is to never call the Sunshine Coast an 'island' \u2013 hopefully\n\n5\t\nSechelt \u2018turmoil\u2019 and \u2018dysfunction\u2019 identified in governance audit\n \nNews\nLocal News\nOpioid Crisis\nCOVID-19\nIn the Community\nBC News\nNational News\nIndigenous News\nWorld News\nReal Estate\nBusiness Wire\nLocal Sports\nNational Sports\nCannabis News\nAnimal Stories\nDigital Edition\nOpinion\nOpinion\nSend us a letter\nArts & Life\nLocal Arts\nLiving\nPhotos and Videos\nAutomotive\nFood\nHealth\nConsumer Technology\nThe Mix\nEvents Calendar\nMore Lifestyes\nFeatures\nWeatherhood\nDriving\nGas Prices\nGuidedBy\nSponsored Content\nTourist Guide\nSpotlight\nHomes\nClassifieds\nView Classified Ads\nPlace a Classified Ad\nObituaries\nLocal Obituaries\nView Legacy Obituaries\nPlace an Obituary/In Memoriam\nConnect\nAdvertise\nContact Us\nDaily Headlines Email\nSupport Local News\nAbout\nContact\nAbout\nAdvertise\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms and Conditions\nPolitical Ads Registry\nVisit our network of sites:\nBowen Island Undercurrent\nBurnaby Now\nBusiness in Vancouver\nCastanet\nCoast Reporter\nDelta Optimist\nLethbridge Herald\nMedicine Hat News\nMoose Jaw Today\nNew West Record\nNorth Shore News\nPique Newsmagazine\nPowell River Peak\nPrince George Citizen\nREW.ca\nRichmond News\nSaskToday.ca\nSquamish Chief\nThe Orca\nTimes Colonist\nTriCity News\nVancouver is Awesome\nWestern Investor\nAirdrie Today\nCochrane Today\nLakeland Today\nMountain View Today\nOkotoks Today\nRocky Mountain Outlook\nSt. Albert Gazette\nTown and Country Today\n\n\u00a9 2024 Coast Reporter"},

MMIWG2S+ has been an ongoing issue that the Indigenous community have been facing in Canada.\n\n\u201cWe reached out to community members in the Nicola Valley, especially the ones that have lost somebody,\u201d said Carole Basil, organizer of the LNIB Red Dress Walk. \u201cI know our band has gone through that in the past few years and it seems to come up in Merritt a little more often now.\u201d\n\nBasil added that the walk is very important not only to those who know a missing or murdered Indigenous woman or girl, but for the community as a whole.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s very traumatizing to the family and the community and we just want to let the people that are impacted know that we care and we remember,\u201d she added,\n\nShe reflects that people can continue to honour the memories of those who went missing or murdered on other occasions as well.\n\n\u201cEspecially on the anniversary of their disappearance or, you know, the anniversary of their murder,\u201d\n\nThose who wish to participate are set to meet up at Shulus Hall at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, May 7. Participants are encouraged to wear red in honour of the movement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a 20-minute walk from Shulus Hall to the Arbor,\u201d she added. \u201cWe sing a few songs, if anybody wants to say anything we don\u2019t get really in depth because we don\u2019t want to really trigger anybody.\u201d\n\nBasil hopes the event will bring the Lower Nicola Indian Band community together and neighbouring communities as well.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many people that are impacted with even just one person going missing, like the family, the community, their friends,\u201d Basil said. \u201cThis walk is for anybody.

I don't want to be forgotten,\" said Honey Flett, a Grade 10 student who was in the march.\n\n\"This was really overwhelming to see how many people decided to participate. I never expected so many.\"\n\nTara Tuchscherer, a teacher at St. James Collegiate, told CTV News the march is part of an entire week at the school meant to bring awareness to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, and raise funds for Drag the Red.\n\n\"A lot of people are unaware of the number of girls and women that are missing,\" Tuchscherer said. \"We don't know what happened to them and their families are having to take it upon themselves to look for them and they need closure.\"\n\nThe province, which is set to project a red dress on the Manitoba Legislative Building Thursday night, said it is an occasion to remember those tragically taken by gender-based violence and to honour the ongoing healing of survivors, their families and communities who have lost loved ones.\n\nTo mark the occasion, people are encouraged to wear red or hang red dresses and ribbons as a visual reminder of the lives lost and to raise awareness about the ongoing fight against gender-based violence.\n\nThe Stefanson government noted in a news release its 2021 commitment to address violence against Indigenous women and girls by introducing amendments to the Path to Reconciliation Act, which established calls for justice from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\n\n\u201cAddressing violence, in particular the incidences of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, is a priority for the province and it is our government's intent to continue to take action to prevent and combat gender-based violence of all forms,\u201d the province said in a news release.\n\nCITY TO HANG RED DRESSES, HOLD CEREMONIAL FIRE\n\nMeanwhile, the City of Winnipeg said it will mark the occasion with red dress displays at all Winnipeg Public Libraries until May 16.\n\nAdditionally, the city said it will host a ceremonial fire at Winnipeg City Hall from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m.\n\n\u201cWe would like to acknowledge the tireless heart-work of the MMIWG2S+ Advisory Committee, and Implementation Team for their guidance as we find our way to walk together to stop and prevent violence to Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+,\u201d the city wrote on its website.\n\nRELATED IMAGES\n1 / 2\nA group of students in Winnipeg marked the National Day of Awareness of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls by marching on May 5, 2022.

The displays were inspired by the REDress Project by M\u00e9tis artist Jaime Black. (Galen Simmons/The Beacon Herald)\nArticle content\n\nIndigenous community members are calling on Stratford and area residents to stand in solidarity with them next Friday in Market Square as part of the national Sisters in Spirit movement honouring missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThroughout the day on Oct. 4, local supporters of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada will host a series of events, beginning with the lighting of a sacred fire at 7:30 a.m. and ending with a Sisters in Spirit vigil at 7 p.m.\n\nThis year\u2019s vigil will feature two speakers, Patsy Day and chef Winona Sands.\n\nDay, a teacher and member of the Turtle Clan, Oneida Nation, will discuss her full-circle journey to reconnect with \u2013 and share \u2013 her language and culture as an adult after she was orphaned at age six through the government assimilation policies of the Indian Act.\n\nSands, part of the Bkejwanong Band on the Walpole Island First Nations Reserve on Lake Erie, will discuss her work as an addictions counsellor, social worker, support worker for First Nations women and children, and as a women\u2019s advocate before she finally signed on as community chef at the Local Community Food Centre in Stratford.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cWith missing and murdered women, for me it\u2019s not just about the women, it\u2019s about all native people in general because men are missing their culture, women are missing their culture,\u201d Sands said. \u201cI myself, being part of the \u201d60s Scoop,\u2019 am also missing who I am, and my culture and language.\n\n\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know who I am. It\u2019s been 50 years in the making of who I am and I want to know exactly who I am, and my culture \u2013 something I can hand down to my grandchildren \u2013 and make people aware of what has really happened\u2026 and is still happening.\u201d\n\nAt the vigil, Sands said volunteers will be handing out squares of moose hide to men and boys who are willing to stand up against violence toward women and children as part of the national Moose Hide Campaign. For more information on the campaign, visit www.moosehidecampaign.ca.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nIn addition to the vigil, more than 25 local businesses and organizations will display red dresses throughout the day to raise awareness of missing and murdered Indigenous women, an act inspired by the REDress Project by M\u00e9tis artist Jaime Black.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just so visual and symbolic,\u201d said Pamela Coneybeare, owner of La Osa Jewelry and Vintage, one of the participating businesses. \u201cI think it has a lot of impact that way. \u2026 It\u2019s a very powerful image when you see something like that. \u2026 It symbolizes women, it symbolizes death, it\u2019s just a very powerful image.\u201d\n\nInformation cards on each of the red dresses displayed will invite the public to attend the vigil. The cards will also feature an image of Stratford artist and residential school survivor Maxine Noel\u2019s painting, Not Forgotten. Noel has been donating all the royalties earned from sales of the painting to the Sisters in Spirit Campaign.\n\nAccording to the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, Indigenous women and girls in Canada \u2013 whether living on reserve or in an urban area, and regardless of age or socio-economic status \u2013 are at least three times more likely to experience violence, and at least six times more likely to be murdered than any other woman or girl in the country.\n\nThe Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada has worked for more than four decades to document systemic violence impacting Indigenous women, girls, their families, and communities.\n\ngsimmons@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\nLATEST NATIONAL STORIES\nNEWS NEAR STRATFORD\nTHIS WEEK IN FLYERS"},

PHOTO BY COLE BURSTON / AFP /Getty Images\nArticle content\n\nThe Manitoba Court of Appeal has dismissed Peter Nygard\u2019s application for a judicial review of an order to extradite the former fashion mogul to the United States, where he faces sex trafficking and racketeering charges.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe panel of three judges says there is no reason to interfere with the 2022 surrender order that the justice minister at the time, David Lametti, made under the Extradition Act.\n\nU.S. authorities sought Nygard\u2019s extradition from Canada on a nine-count indictment filed in New York alleging he was involved in illegal activity for the purpose of sexually abusing and trafficking women and underage girls.\n\nNygard\u2019s lawyers wanted Lametti to ensure their client would not be housed at Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Centre, where they said conditions were terrible.\n\nThey also argued Nygard shouldn\u2019t be surrendered to the U.S. on the racketeering charge because there\u2019s no comparable offence in Canada.\n\nThe Appeal Court says Lametti provided detailed and careful reasons in response to Nygard\u2019s concerns and his surrender order was justified.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nIt says the justice minister was satisfied Nygard, who is in his 80s and in poor health, would be treated humanely and had no reason to doubt the fairness of the U.C. judicial process.\n\nNygard, the founder of a now-defunct woman\u2019s fashion company, faces similar allegations in Canada. The extradition order means he is to be sent to the U.S. once his Canadian court cases are settled.\n\nNygard was found guilty in November of four counts of sexual assault in Toronto for offences from the 1980s to mid-2000s. He was acquitted of a fifth count, as well as a charge of forcible confinement.\n\nNygard also faces one count of sexual assault and one count of forcible confinement in Quebec, as well as sex related charges in Winnipeg.\n\nNone of the charges against Nygard in those jurisdictions, or in the U.S., have been tested in court. He has consistently denied all allegations against him.\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nStop Buying Lottery Tickets & Start Doing This Instead!\nYukon\n|\nSponsored\nClick Here\nCops hunt for suspect after child sexually assaulted\nWinnipeg Sun\nManitoba RCMP shoot and kill man who was allegedly assaulting a woman\nWinnipeg Sun\nCasinos Hate You Doing This.

COLE\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nCopy current article link\n\nThe heavy hitters \u2013 writing both fiction and non-fiction \u2013 are coming out this season with works that take on climate change, sexual assault, slavery and an array of other themes that cannot be ignored. Here\u2019s a look at what to read in the coming months.\n\nTHE TESTAMENTS by Margaret Atwood (McClelland & Stewart)\n\nAll right, the novel probably doesn\u2019t need the plug, but The Testaments is far and away the most highly anticipated book of the year. Readers deeply unsatisfied with Atwood\u2019s vague epilogue in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale \u2013 and the TV series\u2019 version of events \u2013 are hungry to hear what the Toronto author says happens to Offred after she rejects a path to freedom and remains in Gilead. Three narrators give their version of events in what\u2019s guaranteed to roar to the top of bestseller lists. September 10 and Atwood appears at Bluma Appel Theatre on September 16.\n\nHAD IT COMING: WHAT\u2019S FAIR IN THE AGE OF #METOO? by Robyn Doolittle (Allen Lane)\n\nSince playing a major role in exposing Rob Ford\u2019s epic failings, Doolittle has deployed her journalistic expertise to the issue of sexual assault, already uncovering the distressingly low conviction rate of perpetrators in her Unfounded series. Her new book follows that up with deep research into why, despite governments stepping up and in with money and education, our justice system continues to fail survivors. Her major discovery is that judges and police know almost nothing about how trauma affects victims\u2019 memories and, worse, they don\u2019t understand the meaning of consent. September 24 and Doolittle appears at Hot Docs Cinema on September 26.\n\nCHASING PAINTED HORSES, by Drew Hayden Taylor (Cormorant)\n\nFrequent NOW contributor Taylor\u2019s uncanny ability to combine poignancy and humour has made his stories of Indigenous people an important contribution to the First Nations canon. Here, three teenagers try to figure out how and why their odd schoolmate has created an unusual painting of a horse. The image draws them into her fantasy world until they realize something seriously wrong may be behind the painting and try to help the girl. September 21 and Taylor appears at the Toronto International Festival of Authors on October 22.\n\nFEMINIST CITY: A FIELD GUIDE by Leslie Kern (Between the Lines)\n\nSlowly, we\u2019re becoming more aware of how many products are created without women in mind. Scientists do medical research using male subjects only, cars are designed without taking into account the female body. Now, in a series of trenchant essays, geographer Leslie Kern looks at the way cities are designed, examining everything from rape culture to snow removal and imagining a future where urban planning isn\u2019t so hopelessly gendered. October 14\n\nAKIN by Emma Donoghue (HarperCollins)\n\nRetired professor Noah\u2019s life is upended when he adopts his grand-nephew and takes him on a trip to France. Though the two have trouble connecting at first, the boy\u2019s ease with technology leads Noah to uncover surprising details about his mother\u2019s war-time past. In this, the first contemporary novel she\u2019s written since the spectacularly successful Room, Emma Donoghue again demonstrates her facility for tension-ridden storytelling and unusual empathy. September 3 and Donoghue appears at the Toronto Reference Library on September 9.\n\nFRANKISSTEIN, by Jeanette Winterston (Knopf)\n\nA synopsis of Winterston\u2019s latest bold and ambitious novel sounds like she\u2019s all over the place. One thread follows Mary Shelley as she first imagines Frankenstein. Another features a transgender doctor in Brexit Britain who falls in love with a famous expert in artificial intelligence. A third looks at a designer of sex dolls and a fourth explores a cryogenics facility where the dead are waiting to come alive. But Winterston, enraged, outraged and sometimes very funny, has the skill to bring it all together in this strange love story. October 1\n\nFACE IT by Debbie Harry (HarperCollins)\n\nA memoir from Debbie Harry has many things going for it. For starters, the Blondie singer is super smart. For another, while she hung out with musicians from the Ramones to David Bowie, she was also deeply into New York\u2019s art scene and its prime creators, including Jean-Michel Basquiat and Marina Abramovic. Plus, she made over 30 films with the likes of John Waters (Hairspray) and David Cronenberg (Videodrome). All of that experience makes for one of the must-read memoirs of the year. October 1\n\nGIRL by Edna O\u2019Brien (Farrar, Straus and Giroux/Raincoast) CILKA\u2019S JOURNEY by Heather Morris (St. Martin\u2019s/Raincoast)\n\nTwo books by two exceptional authors cover similar brutal experiences of women who have been imprisoned, sexually assaulted and then released only to be re-victimized by their original communities. Both books probe the essential ethical issues faced by hopelessly disempowered people. In Girl, O\u2019Brien\u2019s hotly anticipated new novel, a kidnap victim of Boko Haram escapes and returns home with her child, the product of her rapist, and is mercilessly shamed. Morris follows up The Tattooist Of Auschwitz with another Holocaust story, this one about a girl who sleeps with her concentration camp commandant in order to survive, only to be charged as a collaborator and assaulted again in a Soviet prison when the camp is freed. October 15 and October 1.\n\nQUICHOTTE by Salman Rushdie (Knopf)\n\nRushdie\u2019s Booker Prize-shortlisted follow-up to his superb The Golden House takes another swipe at Trump\u2019s America, this time reimagining the story of Don Quixote. Quichotte and his imagined sidekick Sancho travel an infinitely corrupt U.S. in search of the gorgeous Salma R (get it?) in what turns out to be a novel within a novel, punctuated with splashes of magic realism. Chaotic, funny and driven by Rushdie\u2019s passion for pop culture, Quichotte is literary pandemonium at its wildest. September 3 and Rushdie appears at the Art Gallery of Ontario on September 30.\n\nON FIRE: THE BURNING CASE FOR A GREEN NEW DEAL by Naomi Klein (Knopf)\n\nKlein, now the inaugural Gloria Steinem Endowed Chair in Media, Culture, and Feminist Studies at Rutgers University, is using her influence to back the Green New Deal just as Canada goes to the polls and the U.S. follows suit a year later. Pairing older essays with new works detailing what\u2019s at stake as humans continue to trash the earth, Klein makes the case for a global commitment to a sustainable \u2013 both politically and economically \u2013 path to planetary rescue. September 17 and Klein appears at the Art Gallery of Ontario on September 20.\n\nTHE MAN WHO SAW EVERYTHING by Deborah Levy (Hamish Hamilton)\n\nLevy, twice Booker-shortlisted, delivers a delicately poetic puzzle piece of a book about a man who pays a trip to East Berlin before the wall crumbles and just after he has a strange accident on the famous crosswalk at Abbey Road. This is a meditation on art, beauty, love and sexuality like nothing else. October 15 and Levy appears at Type Books on November 7\n\nTHE WATER DANCER by Ta-Nehisi Coates (One World)\n\nThe debut novel from one of America\u2019s most influential Black writers (Between The World And Me) is a major event. Coates\u2019s slave narrative follows Hiram as he escapes his masters and near death by harnessing his magical powers, then joins a guerrilla cell in the South and later the Underground Railroad movement in the North. What\u2019s new in this narrative is its focus on the all-out war between the slavers and the enslaved. September 24\n\nFIVE WIVES by Joan Thomas (HarperCollins)\n\nJoan Thomas eviscerates the myth of the benevolent missionary in this fictionalized account of how evangelicals descended on the Waorani, an Ecuadorean Indigenous community, devastating their culture and lives. Thomas, who won the Amazon First Novel Award and the Commonwealth Writers\u2019 Prize for Reading By Lightning, delves into the ways the Waorani, who had no previous contact with the outside world, were sacrificed to religious imperialism and capitalist greed by intruders who saw themselves as saviours. September 3\n\nTHE WAGERS by Sean Michaels (Random House)\n\nMichaels has become famous for packing his stories with huge themes. His Giller-winning Us Conductors (my top book of 2015) covers jazz, espionage, science, Soviet prison camps and the unusual beauty of the theremin. In this long-awaited follow-up, he boldly explores the impact of luck and questions its essential worth in a tale about love, life, magic and gambling. September 24\n\nDEATH AND THE SEASIDE by Alison Moore (Biblioasis)\n\nAn aspiring writer with self-esteem issues \u2013 abandoning a PhD thesis will do that to you \u2013 takes a first apartment with a manipulative landlady in this psychological thriller that has all the qualities of a powerful page-turner: an insecure protagonist, a predator who knows how to press her buttons and a holiday location with its own very creepy connotations. October 8\n\nWATCHING YOU WITHOUT ME by Lynn Coady (Anansi)\n\nAfter her mother dies, Karen returns to her Nova Scotia hometown laden with guilt. Living the high life in Toronto, she hasn\u2019t paid much attention to her mother or her developmentally disabled older sister Kelli and now she has to make all the family decisions. At first she appreciates the advice and concern of caregiver Trevor, who\u2019s been assisting the family. But he seems not to understand the meaning of boundaries. This is a taut, intense story about love and manipulation from one of Canada\u2019s best writers. September 24\n\nALSO ON THE HORIZON\n\nSontag by Benjamin Moser (Ecco, September 17), a definitive biography based on Susan Sontag\u2019s previously restricted archives Grand Union, stories by Zadie Smith (Hamish Hamilton, October 8) Find Me by Andr\u00e9 Aciman (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, October 29), revisiting his characters in Call Me By Your Name Olive, Again by Elizabeth Strout (Random House, October 15), again featuring Strout\u2019s irresistible Olive Kittredge Highway Of Tears by Jessica McDiarmid (Doubleday, September 24), meticulously researched non-fiction stories of missing and murdered Indigenous women.\n\n@susangcole\n\nSUSAN G.

FitnessTO has a year-long membership ranging from $190 to $300, which includes access to over 40 weight rooms and 30 indoor pools across the city.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s also an entire list of gyms with weight rooms, cardio machines, fitness classes, and public pools around the city that are free of cost to all residents.\u00a0\n\nROVEENA JASSAL\n\nWRITER / REPORTER\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\nYoutube\nTiktok\n\nFollow us\n@nowtoronto\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWHAT\u2019S TRENDING\nPOSTED 2 DAYS AGO\n\nViral video shows people lined up for hours at Mandarin restaurants for its free buffet on Canada Day.

(Courtesy: Joel Muniz/Unsplash)\nFacebook\nTwitter\nReddit\nCopy current article link\n\nWhen Toronto-based web developer Arjun Sahjpaul completed his software engineering program, he wanted to apply his newly acquired skills into something he was most passionate about: helping people in need.\u00a0\n\nSahjpaul is the creator of Respitely, an online resource for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness in Toronto with an aim to modernize access to their basic needs.\u00a0\n\nThrough Respitely, users can find a list providing daily updates on bed and room availability in often overcrowded shelters. It also contains details on each shelter, including the age demographic it serves, type of shelter (i.e. emergency, transitional) and total capacity.\u00a0\n\nThe site also displays a live drop-in meal tracker, where users can pinpoint the closest centres serving food which are categorized by breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks.\u00a0\n\nThe inspiration for creating this resource came from Sahjpaul being directly engaged in his late mother\u2019s benevolency at a young age, where he and his three siblings would participate in activities such as gathering donations for women\u2019s shelters.\u00a0\n\nHe told Now Toronto that many of his vivid memories include accompanying her on long drives to visit an uncle who struggled with mental health issues, usually bringing clothes and food over.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOver time, these visits helped me understand that those of us who are fortunate to have food and housing have a duty to help those who do not,\u201d Sahjpaul said.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHer insistence on recognizing the struggles faced by others instilled in me the desire and passion to create this platform, with the hope of improving accessibility and connecting those in need with the basics of life.\u201d\n\nA significant challenge for people experiencing homelessness can be the digital divide, where many don\u2019t have access to technology like smartphones or internet access. Sahjpaul admits that while the company\u2019s resources will never be accessible to every Torontonian in need, Respitely aims to digitally connect with as many individuals as possible.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSome studies suggest that the divide may not be as wide as previously thought, with a significant portion of homeless populations (80 to 90 per cent according to one study) having access to cell phones and technology,\u201d he explained.\u00a0\n\nSahjpaul also suggests for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness to utilize the free internet that Toronto Public Library (TPL) offers, where residents can obtain a library card for easy access to computers. As of July 3, customers without internet at home can also receive free take-home Wi-Fi hotspots at select library locations, according to TPL\u2019s website.\u00a0\n\nRespitely hopes to partner with more municipalities across Toronto, and eventually cities across Canada and the rest of the world. For now, the site filters its information directly from the City of Toronto\u2019s Daily Shelter Occupancy system and configures it into a central database, an initiative that Ward 9-Davenport City Councillor Alejandra Bravo finds commendable.\u00a0\n\n\u201cTorontonians care deeply about looking out for one another, and I thank everyone who shows care for our unhoused neighbours,\u201d Bravo told Now Toronto.\n\nJANIECE CAMPBELL\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\nYoutube\nTiktok\n\nFollow us\n@nowtoronto\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWHAT\u2019S TRENDING\nPOSTED 2 DAYS AGO\n\nViral video shows people lined up for hours at Mandarin restaurants for its free buffet on Canada Day.

In 2014, her family filed a complaint against the RCMP and the handling of the case, and just last month received the report.\n\nFort McMurray was just one of many communities who took a moment to remember all the Indigenous women who have are missing and murdered.\n\nPremier Rachel Notley said in a statement that the provincial government cares deeply about the issue.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cOur greatest hope is that these vigils, along with better supports for women, the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, Alberta\u2019s Taking Action Against Racism plan and resolute efforts at every level of society, will help achieve meaningful action to ensure the safety and security of Indigenous women and girls here in Alberta and across Canada,\u201d she said.\n\nMelissa Herman speaks to community members who have gathered at McMurray M\u00c3\u00a9tis to honour and remember missing and murdered Indigenous women on Oct. 4, 2018.

Leanne MacMillan was also in attendance and outlined a plan to bring a restorative justice program to Maskwacis; add more Indigenous members to the local detachment (there is currently four) and work on educating all members on domestic violence issues and how to handle these files.\n\n\u201cForty-two per cent of Indigenous women have been physically abused by an adult when they were a child,\u201d she said, noting the number is 29 per cent for non-Indigenous women. \u201cThese statistics are saddening and shocking at the same time.\u201d\n\nHaving been involved in many of the cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and two-spirits, MacMillan said each of these cases is important.\n\nAdvertisement 6\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nAfter hanging dozens of red dresses in Diamond Jubilee Park and By-the-Lake Park the previous weekend, in Wetaskiwin, a small group gathered at the Peace Cairn May 5.\n\nImmanuel Anglican Church Reconciliation Committee member Fiona Brownlee said, \u201cThis is an important day, not just for Indigenous folks, but for those of us who are allies.

One of his siblings was born on Earth Day (April 22) and the other on Red Dress Day (May 5), the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nTRENDING\nCity of Saskatoon announces new high-level executive\n'He was my best friend': Father remembers son killed in alleged impaired hit-and-run\nWoman charged after altercation on city bus in Saskatoon's Confederation Park neighbourhood\nPolice investigating two stabbings in Saskatoon in two days\nMandryk: Sask.

Standing said having the bison so close to the city provides an important educational opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working for many years to get bison back, and finally they\u2019re there,\u201d he said. \u201cFor our First Nations culture, the bison is very important to us; they\u2019re our relatives.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s good for children to see the bison and to learn about it, how we relate.\u201d\n\nThe two groups are currently in separate pens, but will be allowed to come together in 2021 once the calves are older. Over time, the herd is expected to naturally grow to about 50 animals.\n\nWhile the park remains closed due to restrictions around COVID-19, Brander said she looks forward to opening back up to the public in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives me hope with this COVID period that we\u2019re in, and I think it gives a lot of other people hope too, that there\u2019s better days to look forward to.\u201d\n\namshort@postmedia.com\n\nRECOMMENDED FROM EDITORIAL\n'Circle of life': First baby bison born on Wanuskewin land since before 1876\nA piece of history: Bison reintroduced to Wanuskewin Heritage Park site\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nHeart Surgeon Shares 3 Min Routine For Daily Bowel Movements\nGundry MD\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nThree arrested after drug trafficking investigation in Saskatoon\nSaskatoon StarPhoenix\nLawyer for trucker who caused deadly Broncos crash says families have no right to sue\nSaskatoon StarPhoenix\nSeniors Are Getting Free Hearing Tests (Here's how)\nConnect Hearing\n|\nSponsored\nStudent Discovers Genius Device to Wipe Out Mosquitoes Instantly\nTop Review Picks\n|\nSponsored\nCanadians In Alberta With No Life Insurance Are Taking Advantage Of This\nCovered For Life\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nOne Teaspoon Every Night Burns Body Fat Like Never Before, You Will Fit In Your Pants Again!\nBurn Belly Fat\n|\nSponsored\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\n\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

The highway stretches about 750 kilometres across the centre of the province from Prince George to Prince Rupert.\n\n\"My intentions are to develop and launch a provincial strategy on this that will represent our next steps to enhance transportation services in the corridor, and to do so fairly quickly,\" Stone said Thursday.\n\nHe said he expects to announce changes within weeks.\n\n\"This is one of the top priorities on my desk at the moment and there has been a lot of valuable discussion, lots of goodwill demonstrated by everyone involved, so my goal is to act as quickly as I possibly can.\"\n\nHe said transportation options were discussed earlier this week at meetings in Smithers, with almost 100 people attending, including First Nations, community leaders and government officials.\n\nStone said he's reviewing proposals including improvement of existing B.C. Transit schedules between neighbouring communities such as Houston and Smithers and Terrace and Prince Rupert. He's also considering suggestions to open a health appointment bus in the north to passengers in general.\n\n\"Let's see if we can't get more butts into the seats,\" Stone said.\n\nThe minister said he's on board with expanding a current volunteer transit service that links First Nations communities in the Fort St. James area with neighbouring communities of Vanderhoof and Prince George.\n\n\"This community-based van service, I think there's a winner there,\" Stone said. \"I think there's an opportunity to take that best practice and replicate it in other areas through the corridor.\"\n\nStone said he remains adamant that a regional shuttle bus service favoured by many First Nations is a non-starter. Government documents released recently pegged annual operating costs of a regular shuttle service between Prince George and Prince Rupert at less than $1 million.\n\n\"These are all potentially practical, sustainable solutions,\" Stone said. \"They don't involve establishing a scheduled shuttle bus from Prince Rupert to Prince George.\n\nOpposition New Democrat Jennifer Rice, who represents the Prince Rupert area, said she's disappointed that Stone continues to reject a regional shuttle bus.\n\nRice said she attended the Smithers meeting and spoke with people who have lost family members along the highway. They were disappointed a shuttle bus is being giving short shrift, she said.\n\n\"People have been calling for that for quite a long time. We spend more money on twinning highways.\"\n\nRice said she's awaiting further details of Stone's plans.\n\nStone recently said the highway issue could be part of an inquiry the federal government may call into Canada's murdered and missing women.\n\nAn RCMP report last year stated nearly 1,200 aboriginal women were murdered or went missing between 1980 and 2012.\n\nNews from \u00a9 The Canadian Press, 2015\n\n\nMore News ...\niN RESPONSE: Readers have their say\nFollowing are emailed reader responses to stories or letters to...\nChefs mourn for Okanagan's peaches but adapt to stone fruit wipeout\nKelowna woman loses legal fight with housing co-op over medical cannabis\nFrom no strata fees to discounted golf, Okanagan developers using promos to sell homes\nPopular Kelowna News\nOkanagan contractors fined $19,000 for unsafe building sites\nJuly 02, 2024 6:00 PM\nKamloops homeless day services set to close with no promised replacement\nJuly 03, 2024 6:00 AM\nKelowna breeder wins after being sued over sick Labradoodle\nJuly 03, 2024 7:00 AM\nVernon cabinetmaker ordered to pay $2,500 for shoddy work\nJuly 01, 2024 6:00 AM\n'Merchants of death': Lengthy sentence for Vernon fentanyl dealer\nJuly 01, 2024 6:00 PM\nTop News\nKamloops police investigating targeted gangland shooting\niNwheels\nJuly 04, 2024 1:05 PM\nNo more lengthy delays in Highway 97 rock slide zone near Summerland\niNwheels\nJuly 04, 2024 11:55 AM\nHow to stay cool at work during southern Interior heat wave\nJuly 04, 2024 10:50 AM\nChefs mourn for Okanagan's peaches but adapt to stone fruit wipeout\niNwine\nJuly 04, 2024 9:41 AM\nMan broke into Kelowna construction site, climbed crane\nJuly 04, 2024 7:37 AM\nTrending Now\nTRENDING NOW: Stormtrooper party balloon chaos\nKamloops\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nKamloops Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nKelowna\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nKelowna Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nPenticton\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nPenticton Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nVernon\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nVernon Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\n\u00a9 2024 InfoTel News Ltd\nContact iNFOTEL MULTIMEDIA |\u00a0\nContact iNFOnews |\u00a0\nSubmit News Tips |\u00a0\nPrivacy Policy & Disclaimer |\u00a0\nSitemap |\u00a0\nNewsletter Signup\nView Site in: Desktop | Mobile"},

PHOTO BY PETER POWER /AFP via Getty Images\nArticle content\n\nLast week, with their latest tranche of corporate welfare for the electric vehicle (EV) sector, the Trudeau and Ford governments announced a $5.0 billion subsidy for Honda to help build an EV battery plant and ultimately manufacture EVs in Ontario. Here\u2019s a challenge: if politicians in both governments truly believe these measures are in the public interest, they should tie their personal fortunes with the outcomes of these subsidies (a.k.a. corporate welfare).\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nOne of the major challenges with corporate welfare is the horrendous economic incentives. The politicians and bureaucrats who distribute corporate welfare have no vested financial interest in the outcome of the program. Whether these programs are spectacularly successful (or more likely spectacular failures), the politicians and bureaucrats experience no direct financial gain or loss. Simply put, they\u2019re investing taxpayer money, not their own.\n\nPut differently, the discipline imposed on investors in private markets, such as the risk of losing money or even going out of business, is wholly absent in the government sector. Indeed, the history of corporate welfare in Canada, at both the federal and provincial levels, is rife with abject failures due in large measure to the absence of this investing discipline.\n\nThe Winnipeg Sun's Daily Headline News\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nIn the last 12 months in Ontario, automakers have been major beneficiaries of corporate welfare. The $5.0 billion for Honda is on top of $13.2 billion to Volkswagen and $15.0 billion to Stellantis. That equates to roughly $979 per taxpayer nationally for federal subsidies and an additional $1,372 for Ontario taxpayers. And these figures do not include the debt interest costs that will be incurred as both governments are borrowing money to finance the subsidies.\n\nAnd there\u2019s legitimate reason to be skeptical already of the potential success of these large-scale industrial interventions by the federal (Liberal) and Ontario (Conservative) governments. EV sales in both Canada and the United States have not grown as expected by governments despite purchase subsidies. Disappointing EV sales have led several auto manufacturers including Toyota and Ford to scale back their EV production plans.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThere are also real concerns about the practical ability of EV manufacturers to secure required materials. Consider the minerals needed for EV batteries. According to a recent study, 388 new mines\u2014including 50 lithium mines, 60 nickel mines and 17 cobalt mines\u2014would be required by 2030 to meet EV adoption commitments by various governments. For perspective, there were a total of 340 metal mines operating across Canada and the U.S. in 2021. The massive task of finding, constructing and developing this level of new mines seems impractical and unattainable, meaning that EV plants being built now will struggle to secure needed inputs. Indeed, depending on the type of mine, it takes anywhere from six to 18 years to develop.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nWhich brings us back to the Trudeau and Ford governments. Given the economic incentive problems and practical challenges to a large-scale transition to EVs, would members of the Trudeau and Ford governments\u2014including the prime minister and premier\u2014want to attach a portion of their personal pensions to the success of these corporate welfare programs?\n\nMore specifically, assume an arrangement whereby those politicians would share the benefits of the program\u2019s success but also share any losses through the value of their pensions. If the programs work as marketed, the politicians would enjoy higher valued pensions. But if the programs disappoint or even fail, their pensions would be reduced or even cancelled. Would these politicians still support billions in corporate handouts if their personal financial wellbeing was tied to the outcomes?\n\nAs the funding of private companies to develop the EV sector in Ontario continues with the support of taxpayer subsidies, Ontarians and all Canadians should consider the misalignment of economic incentives underpinning these subsidies and the practical challenges to the success of this industrial intervention.\n\nJason Clemens and Tegan Hill are economists with the Fraser Institute.\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nStop Buying Lottery Tickets & Start Doing This Instead!\nYukon\n|\nSponsored\nClick Here\nCops hunt for suspect after child sexually assaulted\nWinnipeg Sun\nManitoba RCMP shoot and kill man who was allegedly assaulting a woman\nWinnipeg Sun\nCasinos Hate You Doing This.

Our government continues to be committed to meaningful and lasting reconciliation for the benefit of all Saskatchewan residents and I encourage communities and organizations to apply,\u201d he said.\n\nLori Whiteman is from Standing Buffalo First Nation in southern Saskatchewan, and is the daughter of a long-time missing person.\n\n\u201cThose of us who designed the fund were not focused on just raising awareness about murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls, but supporting those who work directly with survivors,\u201d said Whiteman.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure the resources were available to do the work.\u201d\n\nThe Saskatchewan government has set aside $400,000 to distribute to local grassroots Indigenous groups, non-profits and municipalities looking to partner with Indigenous communities, and non-Indigenous non-profits with Indigenous involvement.\n\nFor more information, visit the MMIWG Community Response Fund page on the Government of Saskatchewan\u2019s website.\n\n-Advertisement-\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nCopy URL\nPrevious article\nThe Metro strike could redefine Canada\u2019s grocery industry\nNext article\nTrudeau carbon taxes undermine his claims he\u2019s making life more affordable\nDaily Herald\nhttps://paherald.sk.ca\nFOLLOW US\n\nAccess our archives, 1910 to today's date, with your digital subscription.

This day raises awareness for the missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls across Canada.\n\nhttps://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/indigenous-relations-office/red-dress-day\n\n\"It's important that we are raising awareness and gaining understanding as to why Indigenous women and girls are disproportionately victims to abuse and violence,\" Fisher said.\n\nNative Women's Association of Canada (NWAC) created a database on murdered Indigenous women in 2010. The data shows NWAC has gathered information on about 582 confirmed deaths:\n\n\u2022 67 per cent are murder cases\n\n\u2022 20 per cent are cases of missing women and girls\n\n\u2022 4 per cent are cases of suspicious death\n\n\u2022 9 per cent are unknown cases\n\nBased on a 2017 report of the Department of Justice Canada (DOJ), the number of murdered Indigenous women has increased. Between 1980 and 2014, police reported almost 7,000 female homicide cases \u201416 per cent were Indigenous women. The DOJ summarized how those homicide cases have grown or have remained relatively stable:\n\nhttps://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/jr/jf-pf/2017/july04.html\n\nLast April, a 33-year-old First Nation woman, Linda Mary Beardy, was found dead at the Winnipeg landfill. Based on a CBC report, an autopsy confirmed that she had injuries on her body. The case is still being investigated. But the medical examiner suggested that \u201cnone of Beardy's injuries suggested foul play and police are \"satisfied that this is not a homicide.\u201d Read the story at\n\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/linda-beardy-family-statement-1.6803873\n\n\"There should be equity in regard to the same response that's happening for non-Indigenous people,\u201d said Fisher. \u201cThis should be the same response for Indigenous people.\u201d She noted that \"there could be more\u201d done when it comes to the jobs of the officials.\n\nFisher believes that raising awareness is important, but it is also important to \"support individuals who are struggling within communities . . . with violence and individuals who suffer from trauma.\" She said that solutions to these problems could be steps for justice.\n\nCommemorations for Red Dress Day are different in each community. But during this day, people wear red and hang red dresses on trees. For more background visit https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/red-dress-day\n\n\"Wearing red and understanding each of the movements are important,\" Fisher said. \u201cWithout any action, there is no change. It is all our responsibilities to keep our women, our children, and our community safe.\"\n\nIf you need help on the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women or girls, call 1-844-413-6649 for assistance.\n\n\"I think being vulnerable and telling our stories is important,\" Fisher said.\n\nThe Canadian Press.

(Brennan Phillips - Western News)\nExpand\nListen to this article\n00:03:34\n\nThis article discusses topics which may negatively impact the reader due to its subject matter. If you are affected by the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQI+ people and require support, call 1-844-413-6649 or visit the Government of Canada website for more resources.\n\nAbout 200 people, marched together along Penticton\u2019s waterfront to raise awareness for Missing Murdered Indigenous Women, Children and Two-Spirit+ individuals.\n\nThe walk was one of many taking place across the country on Red Dress Day, May 5, which is dedicated to ending the killing and disappearing of vulnerable Indigenous people.\n\nA year after 50 people showed their commitment to change by walking together in 2023, dozens more joined together to walk from the S.S. Sicamous to Gyro Park along a path lined with donated red dresses.\n\nThe red dress has become a symbol that embodies the lives lost and serves as a powerful reminder of the work that still lies ahead to achieve justice and equity for all.\n\nIn Gyro Park, dignitaries spoke to the importance of the day and the need to see changes brought about. The walk was organized by the Penticton Indian Band, Okanagan Nation Alliance, South Okanagan Metis Society and the City of Penticton and all had representatives who spoke.\n\nAccording to the final report on the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, Indigenous women, girls and Two-Spirited individuals have 12 times the likelihood of going missing or being murdered.\n\n\u201cThere are so many lives that have been lost and so many lives we fear that will continue to be lost. We have members of our own community that have now gone and joined with their ancestors because of these kinds of tragedies,\u201d said Penticton Indian Band Chief Greg Gabriel. \u201cThe fight is not over, but the message has to remain strong.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s walk was made more poignant by the reminder of the suffering the local community has faced this year, as a number of those who joined the walk were outside Penticton\u2019s courthouse in January after news broke that Grace Robotti would be granted day parole.\n\nRobotti received a life sentence for killing Roxanne Louie in 2015 by beating her 26 times with a crowbar, while her brother Pier received a 27-month sentence for helping cover up the killing by dumping Louie\u2019s body on a forest service road.\n\nREAD ALSO: Anger after day parole for Penticton woman who killed great-grandson\u2019s mom\n\n\u201cThe family of our syilx person has to see her and worry about that, and that is unacceptable,\u201d said Jennifer Lewis, the Okanagan Nation Alliance wellness manager. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete disregard and lack of consequences for the justice system. We\u2019ve seen the justice system continue to prioritize offenders over victims and we\u2019ve seen a trend in the Okanagan of probation orders and protective orders given rather than jail time.\n\nThe final report following the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls delivered 231 calls for action and change. Those who joined the walk on Sunday are still waiting for those calls to be fully enacted.\n\nThe dignitaries echoed the call to keep the pressure up on elected officials and the government to make those changes and to teach and share the importance of the day and its cause.\n\nThe walk and speeches ended with a moment of silence and a performance of the Jingle Dance, a healing and prayer dance.\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n\nAbout the Author: Brennan Phillips\n\nBrennan was raised in the Okanagan and is thankful every day that he gets to live and work in one of the most beautiful places in Canada.\nRead more\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tVernon cowgirl ropes in B.C.

Some information may no longer be current.\n\nA sign warning residents and visitiors that a killer is at work along the Highway of Tears stands in Moricetown, British Columbia, in this 2011 file photo.\nRAFAL GERSZAK\n\nCOMMENTS\nSHARE\n\nBritish Columbia is set to announce transportation service upgrades along the so-called Highway of Tears, but the minister responsible says a region-wide shuttle bus sought by First Nations won't be part of the plan.\n\nTransportation Minister Todd Stone said he's considering options such as supporting volunteer-driven vans that link First Nations reserves with communities, improving existing transit schedules and expanding use of a bus that takes people to and from medical appointments.\n\nEighteen women have been murdered or disappeared along Highway 16 and adjacent routes since the 1970s. The highway stretches about 750 kilometres across the centre of the province from Prince George to Prince Rupert.\n\n\"My intentions are to develop and launch a provincial strategy on this that will represent our next steps to enhance transportation services in the corridor, and to do so fairly quickly,\" Mr. Stone said Thursday.\n\nHe said he expects to announce changes within weeks.\n\n\"This is one of the top priorities on my desk at the moment and there has been a lot of valuable discussion, lots of goodwill demonstrated by everyone involved, so my goal is to act as quickly as I possibly can.\"\n\nHe said transportation options were discussed earlier this week at meetings in Smithers, with almost 100 people attending, including First Nations, community leaders and government officials.\n\nMr. Stone said he's reviewing proposals including improvement of existing BC Transit schedules between neighbouring communities such as Houston and Smithers and Terrace and Prince Rupert. He's also considering suggestions to open a health-appointment bus in the north to passengers in general.\n\n\"Let's see if we can't get more butts into the seats,\" Mr. Stone said.\n\nThe minister said he's on board with expanding a current volunteer transit service that links First Nations communities in the Fort St. James area with neighbouring communities of Vanderhoof and Prince George.\n\n\"This community-based van service, I think there's a winner there,\" Mr. Stone said. \"I think there's an opportunity to take that best practice and replicate it in other areas through the corridor.\"\n\nMr. Stone said he remains adamant that a regional shuttle bus service favoured by many First Nations is a non-starter. Government documents released recently pegged annual operating costs of a regular shuttle service between Prince George and Prince Rupert at less than $1-million.\n\n\"These are all potentially practical, sustainable solutions,\" Mr. Stone said. \"They don't involve establishing a scheduled shuttle bus from Prince Rupert to Prince George.\n\nOpposition New Democrat Jennifer Rice, who represents the Prince Rupert area, said she's disappointed that Mr. Stone continues to reject a regional shuttle bus.\n\nMs. Rice said she attended the Smithers meeting and spoke with people who have lost family members along the highway. They were disappointed a shuttle bus is being giving short shrift, she said.\n\n\"People have been calling for that for quite a long time. We spend more money on twinning highways.\"\n\nMs. Rice said she's awaiting further details of Mr. Stone's plans.\n\nMr. Stone recently said the highway issue could be part of an inquiry the federal government may call into Canada's murdered and missing women.\n\nAn RCMP report last year stated nearly 1,200 aboriginal women were murdered or went missing between 1980 and 2012.\n\nSign up for the B.C.

They\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happening on our campuses.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThey\u2019ve seen and read the news reports \u2014 reports showing over-privileged white Gen Z and millennial types in keffiyahs, demanding if the visitors to their campus encampments, their \u201cLittle Gazas,\u201d are Jews. They\u2019ve seen the chanted tributes to Hamas and Iran and the horrors of Oct. 7. They\u2019ve seen all that.\n\nAnd they\u2019re disgusted. They\u2019re shocked. They\u2019re appalled.\n\nThey\u2019re absolutely baffled why young Canadians \u2014 and young Americans, and young Europeans \u2014 are openly expressing so much contempt towards the Jewish state.\n\nIn other circumstances, at other times, Israelis are used to seeing protests against them in Canada and the United States and Europe. Those protests have been happening, more or less continuously, since Israel was founded in 1948. They\u2019re not new.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nBut the anti-Israel encampments at places of higher learning in North America \u2014 the pro-Hamas, pro-Iran, pro-terror encampments, in too many cases? That, they can\u2019t believe. That is new.\n\nAt a table selling T-shirts and bracelets to raise funds for the families of the 128 Oct. 7th hostages, Judy Goldman shakes her head. Goldman is a former Montrealer, and still has family in Toronto and the Vancouver area.\n\nShe\u2019s present this day with a dark-haired friend, whose son, 23-year-old Yosef Haim Ohana, is still being held hostage by Hamas. Her friend doesn\u2019t want to talk about politics, she says. But Judy does. She has a few things to get off her mind.\n\n\u201cI am shocked by what I have seen at these campuses,\u201d she says. \u201cShocked. It is pure anti-Semitism.\n\nThe Winnipeg Sun's Daily Headline News\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cAnti-Semitism is always there. It bubbles underneath the surface. Any excuse can bring it out. But I\u2019m very surprised to see what young Canadians, at universities in places like Toronto, are doing.\u201d She shakes her head again.\n\nRecommended video\n\nShe continues: \u201cIt\u2019s shocking, because universities are supposed to be places where morality is taught. And what\u2019s happening in those places is just outlandish. It shouldn\u2019t be happening! At places like McGill, too, which I know well.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s normal for young people to be preoccupied with issues like climate change or the future, says Judy. But to praise Hamas, who slaughtered 1,200 men, women, children and babies on Oct. 7, 2023? \u201cIt is absolutely beyond words,\u201d says Judy.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nA few feet away, at a booth that has been set up for the hostages taken from the kibbutz Nahal Oz, Iris Shellhav Nahal is talking to whoever will listen. She\u2019s wearing a T-shirt bearing the images of some of her neighbours who were killed or kidnapped on Oct. 7.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d she says of the encampments and protests.\u00a0 \u201cWhat I have seen? It\u2019s not good. Where did [the students] get these terrible ideas? They\u2019re ignorant. They don\u2019t know history \u2014 they don\u2019t know what Hamas means to us!\u201d\n\nIris softens a bit and leans back in her chair. \u201cSome of the students, I\u2019m sure they\u2019re not bad people,\u201d she says, pausing. \u201cBut how can they say we are so terrible when we are the ones who were attacked first? It\u2019s just terrible.\u201d\n\nNext door, there is a booth to promote the memory of the victims of the Re\u2019im Music Festival on the 7th. There\u2019s an older man sitting there, but he doesn\u2019t speak English.\n\nAdvertisement 6\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 7\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nTwo women who are present, Liora and Aziza \u2014 they speak a little English, but not so well, they say \u2014 won\u2019t give their last names. \u201cIt makes me mad,\u201d says Liora of the encampments. Says Aziza: \u201cWe know kids who were killed at the music festival. Why don\u2019t these kids in Canada and America understand? They look like our kids.\u201d\n\nAsked why they think young people in Western universities have embraced the hateful rhetoric of Hamas and its ilk, all of\u00a0 the women have theories about that, too. They speculate that there are many anti-Israel Muslims or Arabs at North American universities who have manipulated the protests they see in TV. They also wonder if the ones camped out have been brainwashed by their professors.\n\nAt the same booth where Judy Goldman volunteers, a lovely woman from Manchester is working. Her name is Sara Omer, and she still has a thick Manchurian accent.\n\nAdvertisement 8\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nSara explains she has three sons in the Israel Defence Force, one stationed this day in southern Gaza. He\u2019s been sleeping under the stars, she says, and he\u2019s excited that some toilets and showers have finally been shipped in. She smiles when she talks about him.\n\nSara\u2019s husband was killed in military action a few years back, and she works with the hostage families, she says, because she understands what it means to lose someone to the fight for Israel.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t, however, understand how any North American young person can raise their voice in support of a racist, hateful death cult like Hamas.\n\nAdvertisement 9\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cI read the New York Times every day,\u201d Sara says.\u00a0 \u201cI read over the weekend that in Columbia University, 60% at the encampments are just outsiders. They\u2019re not students. They\u2019re outsiders, and they\u2019re coming, and they\u2019re firing up the others.\n\nShe goes on: \u201cAnd some of the students who were interviewed \u2014\u00a0 they don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re protesting. They don\u2019t understand.\n\n\u201cIt makes my blood boil.\u201d\n\nTwo things to conclude with: Everyone here \u2014 everyone this writer spoke to \u2014 is here because they want to be. Not only do they not work for the Netanyahu government, they\u2019re furious with the Netanyahu government. They want the hostages home, now, and feel the Israeli Prime Minister has botched the job.\n\nThe other thing: Everyone here is carefully watching what is happening in North America, at supposed places of higher education. They haven\u2019t missed it.\n\nAnd they don\u2019t understand it. At all.\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nStop Buying Lottery Tickets & Start Doing This Instead!\nYukon\n|\nSponsored\nClick Here\nCops hunt for suspect after child sexually assaulted\nWinnipeg Sun\nManitoba RCMP shoot and kill man who was allegedly assaulting a woman\nWinnipeg Sun\nCasinos Hate You Doing This.

(Hannah Schmidt/CTV News)\n\nIt was an especially emotional day for Serena Wesley who says she was nine-years-old when her mother was killed by her boyfriend in 1986.\n\n\u201cI walk for my mom, Roberta Chafe Wesley. She was a part of the residential school, a day school survivor, and I understand her more now as an adult than I ever did as a child,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Red Dress Day comes around each year on May 5, Wesley still thinks of her mother, but also of all the other victims that have died or are still missing.\n\n\u201cIt is literally a worry for me every day that Indigenous young girls, you know, they can walk out the door and possibly not come back.\u201d\n\n150 red dresses and pants were displayed throughout Kitchener\u2019s Victoria Park to serve as a tribute to the lives lost.\n\n\u201cSometimes I feel hopeless and at other times I feel all you can do is try to do what you can do and to live your life as an ally, to support and try to help create change one voice at a time,\u201d said attendee Mark Wotton.\n\nThe significance of Red Dress Day extends beyond just one day of remembrance. It's a call to action for groups to address the root causes of violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit individuals.\n\n\u201cIf they understand where our fears come from and why we are the way we are and generational trauma they can maybe understand it, they can help break the cycle,\u201d Wesley explained.\n\n\u201cI'm honoured to be a part of it and I also feel that it's my responsibility because, yes, the community has become involved, but it's a small part of the community,\u201d Wotton said. \u201cThere's so many people that are either indifferent to it or don't support it. The governments have not been as proactive or active and just focusing on the harm that has already happened to Indigenous people, but not the harm that happens every day.\u201d\n\nRed Dress Day comes just days after The Healing of the Seven Generations reported a theft from their cultural display to police.\n\n\u201cThis year we got vandalized and it's just an indicator to say where people are in their own mindset to have to come in and vandalize something that was a memorial. Why would they do that?\u201d Dubie questioned.\n\nRegional police are continuing to investigate the matter and encourage anyone with information to contact them.\n\nFor the Indigenous community in Waterloo Region, their narrative remains the same.\n\n\u201cThings need to step up,\u201d Dubie said. \u201cThe safety of our children and the safety of our kids depends on that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope that if my mom was here today, she would be proud to embrace her culture like we\u2019re proud to live it and teach it and to make sure that she's a part of her granddaughters\u2019 lives and helping them grow and learn that culture and not let that residential school kill her spirit,\u201d Wesley said.\n\nRELATED IMAGES\n1 / 2\nCut outs of red clothing are displayed on the lawn of Victoria Park in Kitchener, each baring the name of a murdered or missing Indigenous person.

The students and staff arranged a display at the entrance of the school with a red dress, a basket of moosehide pins and cards of information about Missing and Murdered Indigenous Woman and Girls (MMIWG) pinned to the dress.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nSome of the information on the dress displayed at EHS includes that Indigenous women are 12 times more likely to go missing or be murdered than other women, requests to the readers to educate themselves on the subject, that 34% of Indigenous women will be sexually violated, that 40% of Indigenous women will experience violence from their partner, and other facts. The basket of pins from the Moose Hide tag Campaign are symbols showing that the wearer opposes violence against women and all those in the gender continuum.\n\nThe National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls started in 2010. It is a solemn event marked by displays, marches and processions each year and is a call to action.\n\nOn May 4, Roseanne Archibald, the Assembly of First Nations National Chief, spoke with King Charles III in London about supporting the results of Canada\u2019s National Inquiry into MMIWG.\n\nDisplaying a red dress is encouraged on Red Dress Day and the hanging of empty dresses are visual reminders of the thousands of missing women and girls. Students and staff at EHS have shown their support for the losses of the women and the pain felt by their families.\n\nPhoto credit to Jayson StewartTo honour Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, students and staff placed a red dress with information and a basket of moose hide tags in the foyer of Espanola High School.\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\nLATEST NATIONAL STORIES\nNEWS NEAR KIRKLAND LAKE\nTHIS WEEK IN FLYERS"},

It featured 60 red dresses hung from trees around Ward Lake \u2014 located in Southeast Alaska on Revillagigedo Island \u2014 each representing an Indigenous person from\u00a0Ketchikan, Saxman, Prince of Wales Island, and Metlakatla\u00a0 who is missing or has been murdered.\n\u00a0\n\nThe garments were installed on May 15 to commemorate MMIP Awareness Month under a permit KIC held from the U.S. Forestry Service. By the time the installation was scheduled to come down on May 31, 48 of the dresses were missing. In recent days, photos have been surfacing on social media\u00a0showing some of the dresses crumpled near the lakeside trail, half buried or discarded in piles near drain pipes.\n\nNever miss Indian Country\u2019s biggest stories and breaking news.\u00a0Sign up to get our reporting sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEnter your email\n\u00a0\n\nThe tribe\u2019s council issued a statement condemning \u201ca hurtful and disrespectful act that undermines the efforts to bring understanding and raise awareness about the MMIP epidemic.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSimilar installations are featured throughout Canada and the United States during May to bring awareness to the disproportionate number of Indigenous people who are victims of violent crimes or go missing.\u00a0\n\nMurder is the third leading cause of death for Native women, with the murder rate ten times higher than the national average for women living on reservations,\u00a0according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0In 2021,\u00a0Alaska reported\u00a0229 cases of missing and murdered Indigenous persons \u2014 149 missing and 80 murdered.\n\nGloria Burns, KIC\u2019s vice president and the chair of the social services committee, told\u00a0local radio station KRBD\u00a0that the tribe hung the dresses with remembrance and intention in an effort to create a \u201csafe space.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u201cAnd so when you\u2019re going through that process of trying to create a safe space, and then it\u2019s intentionally made unsafe, it feels very much like a violation,\u201d Burns told KRBD. \u201cI think, you know, the hard part is that missing and murdered indigenous people, it\u2019s been happening since colonization, we really don\u2019t talk about it.

For assistance, call 1-844-413-6649.\n\nTrauma-informed support is also available to all those impacted by the ongoing crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit and gender-diverse people through the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Health and Cultural Support Program. The program funds access to cultural support (e.g., Elders, Knowledge Holders, and Traditional Healers), emotional support (e.g., community-based health workers, peer supports), and registered mental health counsellors (e.g., psychologists, and social workers).\n\nOttawa, Ontario (May 5, 2024) - Traditional unceded Algonquin Territory\n\nToday, the Honourable Gary Anandasangaree, Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations; the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Indigenous Services and Minister responsible for FedNor; the Honourable Dan Vandal, Minister of Northern Affairs; and the Honourable Marci Ien, Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth; issued the following statement:\n\n\"Since M\u00e9tis artist Jaime Black began the REDress Project in 2010, red dresses hanging in public spaces have become a stark visual reminder of every Indigenous woman, girl, Two-Spirit, and gender-diverse person in Canada who has gone missing or been murdered.\n\n\"Today, on Red Dress Day, we honour every First Nation, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis life lost to this crisis, and we reaffirm our efforts to bring the missing home. Ahead of Red Dress Day, the governments of Canada and Manitoba announced a partnership to co-develop a pilot Red Dress Alert system together with Indigenous partners. This was made possible by the $1.3 million investment included in Budget 2024. Alert systems can help ensure that when an Indigenous woman, girl, Two-Spirit or gender-diverse person goes missing, they are found.\n\n\"We stand united in affirming our unwavering commitment to addressing this national crisis and collectively working toward a secure, violence-free future for all Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit and gender-diverse people. We also recognize that means supporting grassroots, Indigenous-led and community-driven change through housing, shelters, policing, and infrastructure initiatives, such as the Inuvialuit Family Wellness Centre that provides shelter for Indigenous women and families in Inuvik, the Indigenous Victim and Family Liaison Program that helps individuals and family members navigate culturally-appropriate health and wellbeing supports, and new rural public transit studies to better connect communities undertaken by the Nahanni Butte First Nation, Yellowknives Dene First Nation, and the Hay River M\u00e9tis Government.\n\n\"The work to end the national crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit, and gender diverse people is ongoing, and a lot more remains to be done. The federal government is committed to learning from Indigenous partners in a way that respects our shared priorities. We will continue to use the Federal Pathway, the National Action Plan\n\n/Public Release.

Credit: CPAC Credit: CPAC\n\nContent warning: The following story contains details of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. Individuals impacted by the issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls can contact the MMIWG Crisis Line toll-free at 1-844-413-6649.\n\nMay 5 is Red Dress Day, a day where Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and Two-Spirit persons (MMIWG2S) are recognized and remembered.\n\nOn May 2, the House of Commons voted unanimously in favour of declaring\u00a0MMIWG2S a nation-wide emergency and also agreed to provide funding for an alert system to inform the public when an Indigenous person is missing.\n\nWinnipeg Centre NDP MP Leah Gazan has long called for a national Red Dress Alert system, and it was her motion that received universal backing from her colleagues in the House of Commons.\n\n\u201cThis is a crisis,\u201d said Gazan on Tuesday. \u201cPeople are going murdered and missing everyday. We are precious. We are valuable. We are loved and we are not garbage.\u201d\n\nGazan was referring in her statement to the bodies of Indigenous women from her riding being found in a Winnipeg landfill in late 2022 and early 2023.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m standing alongside my sisters today, to support their calls on the government to fully support a Canada-wide Emergency, and immediately support the development of a Canada-wide Red Dress Alert system without delay,\u201d Gazan added.\n\nIn addition to the Canada-wide emergency and Red Dress Alert system, Gazan also called on the government for a housing and social support system for children aging out of the childcare system. She has also been calling for a guaranteed livable basic income and is asking the government to carry out prevention initiatives that honour the rights of Indigenous women and girls and two-spirit peoples.\n\nMMIWG2S an ongoing crisis\n\nIndigenous peoples make up five per cent of Canada\u2019s total population, but according to Canada\u2019s own Ministry of Justice, in 2017 Indigenous women accounted for 10 per cent of all missing Canadian women. In 2014, Indigenous women accounted for 21 per cent of all murdered women in Canada.\n\nEven in the same week where the Red Dress Alert initiative found strong political support in Ottawa, stories of assault against Indigenous women continued to appear in headlines in Canada.\n\nThe body of an eight-year-old Indigenous girl was found near Samson Cree First Nation in Alberta, the autopsy concluding the girl was a victim of homicide.\n\nSandra Delaronde of the Cross Lake First Nation and co-chair of Manitoba\u2019s MMIWG2S Coalition spoke at a press conference alongside Gazan after the House of Commons vote.\n\n\u201cWe have no time to waste. Everyday that goes by, we have at least two women and girls that go missing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have on a weekly basis, our Indigenous sisters, mothers, daughters and granddaughters that go murdered. The time to wait is gone.\u201d\n\nGovernment has been slow to respond to MMIWG2S crisis\n\nIn 2021, the federal government announced a national action plan to address 231 calls to action that were issued by a national inquiry into MMIWG2S, however, one year after it was introduced, the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada (NWAC) found that few of the calls to action had been implemented.\n\nREAD MORE: One year after introducing action plan, feds continue to abandon MMIWG\n\nIn a press release sent by the NWAC to media prior to Tuesday\u2019s vote, Mel Critch co-chair of Manitoba Moon Voices Inc. blasted the federal government for their continued lack of action.\n\n\u201cThis is alarming and needs to be addressed immediately due to the on-going genocide, compounded by the lack of implementation of the 231 Calls for Justice and therefore lack of human security our Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse peoples face,\u201d said Critch.\n\nThe unanimous consent motion introduced by Gazan and passed in the House of Commons was non-binding, but Gazan said that this massive show of support from MPs should push the government to take steps to make a Red Dress Alert system a reality.\n\n\u201cWhen I put forward that unanimous consent motion today, if members of Parliament and this House really care about gender-based violence; if this government really cares about gender-based violence, I will feel affirmed to know that there will be nobody opposing in the House. And we will be watching. This genocide needs to end. We are not garbage,\u201d Gazan said.\n\nSupport rabble today!\n\nWe\u2019re so glad you stopped by!

I saved the babies. I feel like the babies saved me.\u201d\n\nLike Bernard, Dolena Poulette made the hour-long drive from We'koqma'q to take part in Thursday\u2019s walk.\n\nShe carried an orange sign acknowledging the Indigenous lives lost in the Canadian residential school system.\n\n\"Because this was all part of it,\u201d said Poulette. \u201cMissing and murdered Indigenous women. These women were children one time too, and they were mothers. Mothers that lost their children.\"\n\nThe walk was organized by the Jane Paul Centre, a not-for-profit community organization that tries to help Indigenous women living in the city.\n\nOrganizer Heidi Marshall says many in the community deal with homelessness, violence, poverty and addiction, and more help is needed.\n\n\"All our services and programs are made and developed from a colonial perspective,\u201d said Marshall.\n\n\"We need to ensure that our peoples' voices are being heard in any type of service that we're providing these women, girls and our people as well.\"\n\nRELATED IMAGES\n1 / 1\nReport an error\nEditorial standards & policies\nWhy you can trust CTV News\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nMUST WATCH\n\nMassive sinkhole swallows part of soccer field in Illinois\n\nGiant basking shark spotted off eastern shore of Nova Scotia\n\nClothing store employees fight off armed robber in Toronto\n\nVideo shows bus smash into couple's vehicle in Windsor\n\nBest friends in N.B. recreate graduation pictures from 1984\n\n'Oh god, I'm gonna get hit': Driver clipped by airplane\n\nThieves smash truck through, rob adult toy store in Alta.\n\nOttawa 'fat cat' goes on unbelievable weight loss journey\n\nThis bus driver has been bringing kids to school since 1974\n\nWorkers left dangling from Toronto's St. Regis Hotel rescued\n\nWant to go cage diving with sharks in Atlantic Canada?\n\nOfficer rushes into burning home to save elderly couple\n\n19-year-old fights off shark after attack on Texas beach\n\nMoment fatal fire breaks out in South Korea factory\n\nHow you can manage the risks of West Nile Virus in Canada\n\nHiker stranded for 10 days in Calif. mountains speaks out\n\nQuestions raised about realtors using AI to sell homes\n\nTravis Kelce joins Taylor Swift on stage during London show\n\nATLANTIC TOP STORIES\n'Absolutely amazing video': Basking shark spotted along eastern shore of Nova Scotia\n6 people injured in N.S. highway collision\nN.S. couple wins $500K from Atlantic Lottery ticket\nWatch Live Now: Canadian analysis ahead of the CNN Presidential Debate\nDalhousie med school sees more family doctor graduates than other fields\nN.B. medical officer declares whooping cough outbreak on Acadian Peninsula\n'I do have concerns': N.B.

Ceremonies and similar displays will be taking place across the country.\n\nThe dresses were raised by a boom lift and come from the Pathways to Higher Learning students, sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh Nation said in a social media post. The students were inspired after attending the MMIWG March in Vancouver\u00a0on Feb. 14.\n\n\"The event in Vancouver is especially important to our community as it was started to remember and honour the loss of one of our own community members. Our students were so moved by the event, that they wanted to do more and from that came the Red Dress project you see in front of our Nation buildings. Each dress is a personal work of art, created by our students to express their feelings,\"\u00a0sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh Nation's post said.\u00a0\n\n\"The dresses are hung to represent the women who have not made it home, who are missing and murdered. We want to show the world that they matter. Great Gratitude to leadership for standing behind this project and helping to make it a reality. Great Gratitude to our students for the beautiful, meaningful and impactful works of art now hanging from the eaves of the Nation offices.\"\n\nCalls to action\n\nOn May 2, the House of Commons unanimously backed a motion to declare the deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls a Canada-wide emergency. That motion also calls for funding a new system to alert the public when someone goes missing.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEven though the final report into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls was released four years ago not much has changed, said Carol McBride, the head of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada. \u201cWe are in a crisis.\u201d\n\nThe Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada has created the website SafePassage, a \"community-driven, trauma-informed, and survivor centred initiative\" that \"tracks cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, transgender, gender-diverse, and Two-Spirit people (MMIWG2S+), monitors ongoing safety concerns, provides distinctions-based safety resources, educates the public and media about the MMIWG2S+ genocide, and commemorates and honours our stolen loved ones.\"\n\nThe report\n\nThe final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls\u00a0was released in June 2019 and came after two years of public hearings and evidence gathering across the country where the inquiry heard from more than 2,380 \"family members, survivors of violence, experts and Knowledge Keepers,\"\u00a0according to the inquiry website. The final report identified 231 calls for justice for \"governments, institutions, social service providers, industries and all Canadians\" under themes\u00a0of\u00a0culture, health and wellness, human security, and justice.\n\n\"The truths shared in these National Inquiry hearings tell the story \u2013 or, more accurately, thousands of stories \u2013 of acts of genocide against First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people,\" says the introduction to the final report's executive summary. \"This violence amounts to a race-based genocide of Indigenous Peoples, including First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis, which especially targets women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people.\n\n\"This genocide has been empowered by colonial structures, evidenced notably by the Indian Act, the Sixties Scoop, residential schools, and breaches of human and Inuit, M\u00e9tis and First Nations rights, leading directly to the current increased rates of violence, death, and suicide in Indigenous populations.\"\n\nFollowing the report's release, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to develop and implement a national action plan to address MMIWG2S+, which was released in 2021.\u00a0A\u00a0progress report was\u00a0produced\u00a0in 2022.\u00a0\n\nWith files from Kelly Geraldine Malone, The Canadian Press\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nLetter to the editor\nReport a mistake\nThis has been shared 1 time\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nRelated\n\t'We are in a crisis': Red Dress Day honoured as leaders say more work to be done\n\tNDP MP urges feds to create 'Red Dress Alert' for missing Indigenous women\n\t'I can make the difference': Sunshine Coast honours National Day of Truth and Reconciliation\n\nCOMMUNITY POLL\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nAre you following provincial election pre-campaigning?\n Yes\n No\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nTRENDING TODAY\n1\t\nUpdated: Injuries sustained in Highway 101 crash near Halfmoon Bay\n\n2\t\nSunshine Coast SAR responds to Canada Day callout to Smuggler Cove \n\n3\t\nSpy-hopping whales caught on camera in Porpoise Bay June 29 \n\n4\t\nOpinion: My promise to you is to never call the Sunshine Coast an 'island' \u2013 hopefully\n\n5\t\nSechelt \u2018turmoil\u2019 and \u2018dysfunction\u2019 identified in governance audit\n \nNews\nLocal News\nOpioid Crisis\nCOVID-19\nIn the Community\nBC News\nNational News\nIndigenous News\nWorld News\nReal Estate\nBusiness Wire\nLocal Sports\nNational Sports\nCannabis News\nAnimal Stories\nDigital Edition\nOpinion\nOpinion\nSend us a letter\nArts & Life\nLocal Arts\nLiving\nPhotos and Videos\nAutomotive\nFood\nHealth\nConsumer Technology\nThe Mix\nEvents Calendar\nMore Lifestyes\nFeatures\nWeatherhood\nDriving\nGas Prices\nGuidedBy\nSponsored Content\nTourist Guide\nSpotlight\nHomes\nClassifieds\nView Classified Ads\nPlace a Classified Ad\nObituaries\nLocal Obituaries\nView Legacy Obituaries\nPlace an Obituary/In Memoriam\nConnect\nAdvertise\nContact Us\nDaily Headlines Email\nSupport Local News\nAbout\nContact\nAbout\nAdvertise\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms and Conditions\nPolitical Ads Registry\nVisit our network of sites:\nBowen Island Undercurrent\nBurnaby Now\nBusiness in Vancouver\nCastanet\nCoast Reporter\nDelta Optimist\nLethbridge Herald\nMedicine Hat News\nMoose Jaw Today\nNew West Record\nNorth Shore News\nPique Newsmagazine\nPowell River Peak\nPrince George Citizen\nREW.ca\nRichmond News\nSaskToday.ca\nSquamish Chief\nThe Orca\nTimes Colonist\nTriCity News\nVancouver is Awesome\nWestern Investor\nAirdrie Today\nCochrane Today\nLakeland Today\nMountain View Today\nOkotoks Today\nRocky Mountain Outlook\nSt. Albert Gazette\nTown and Country Today\n\n\u00a9 2024 Coast Reporter"},

There people showed their support for those with missing or murdered family and friends.\n\n\"I remember at nine years old, my sister became a poster child for being murdered and missing,\" said Elroy Fontaine, the brother of Tina Fontaine.\n\nTina's body was found in the Red River in 2014, wrapped in a duvet that was weighed down with rocks. She was 15 years old when she was killed.\n\nElroy says he often goes to MMIWG2S marches in honour of his sister.\n\n\"To try and change something, to try and change this ongoing genocide,\" he said.\n\nThe rally encouraged people to write to their local politicians, calling for action.\n\n\"We do these marches to try and open people's eyes. We have opened people's eyes, but not the right ones,\" Elroy said.\n\nHUNDREDS MARCH IN SAGKEENG FIRST NATION WHERE MORE THAN 20 CASES REMAIN UNSOLVED\n\nIn Sagkeeng First Nation, hundreds took part in a march to mark the day.\n\nIt comes after the chief of Sagkeeng voiced his disappointment earlier this week for a lack of government resources to address the 231 calls for justice outlined in the national inquiry report.\n\nSagkeeng has the most unsolved cases of missing or murdered Indigenous women and girls in Manitoba - resulting in Friday's walk taking on a personal meaning for many.\n\n\"If we suffer just one day walking for them, imagine what they go through on a daily basis. Not knowing where they are, not understanding what is happening, not realizing that there are so many other missing and murdered women too,\" said Mary Swampy, a resident of the First Nation. \"If I can do this, I'm very grateful for it.\"\n\nCurrently there are more than 20 cases of unsolved missing Indigenous women and girls from Sagkeeng First Nation.\n\nDISPLAY TO BE SET UP OVER THE WEEKEND AT HUMAN RIGHTS MUSEUM\n\nThe Canadian Museum for Human Rights is opening a display in recognition of the day. The display includes items from selected community members who have been impacted by MMIWG2S+.\n\nThe display will be set up throughout the weekend and free for people to see.\n\nIn a joint statement from Premier Heather Stefanson, Indigenous and Reconciliation and Northern Relations Minister Eileen Clarke and Families Minister Rochelle Squires, they encouraged Manitobans to join in honouring the memories of MMIWG.\n\n\"Today, we remember those who have lost their lives to gender-based violence, and we honour the healing journeys of families and communities that live with the ongoing grief of losing a loved one,\" the statement read.\n\nThe Legislative Building will be lit with an image of the red dress, which the province says is a sign to continue dialogue and bring attention to the issue.\n\n-With files from CTV's Jill Macyshon and Devon McKendrick\n\nRELATED IMAGES\n1 / 2\nCrowds march through Downtown Winnipeg on Red Dress Day on May 5, 2023, honouring murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls and two-spirited people.

A red dress is hangs on a light fixture on National Day of Awareness for the prevention of violence against Indigenous women, also known as the Red Dress Day in Ottawa, Friday, May 5, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Spencer Colby\n\nCanada and Manitoba are partnering to launch an alert system that would inform the public when an Indigenous woman or girl goes missing, they announced Friday in Winnipeg, ahead of a national day to mark the crisis.\n\nThe long-awaited Red Dress Alert system is a bid to prevent deaths and increase safe reunions with loved ones.\u00a0\n\nStatistics Canada concluded in a report last year that the homicide rate for Indigenous women and girls was six times higher than the rate for their non-Indigenous counterparts.\u00a0\n\nA national inquiry concluded five years ago that they are 12 times more likely to go missing or murdered.\n\n\"This is a historic moment, and a major step toward ending the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse peoples,\" said NDP MP Leah Gazan, who has lead federal advocacy on the alert.\n\n\"And while we celebrate this historic moment, it is critical to remember that we are not done until a Red Dress Alert is no longer needed.\"\n\nThe Manitoba pilot is to be designed with and led by Indigenous Peoples, and is expected to help inform an eventual national alert system.\u00a0\n\nIt will be funded through moneys set aside in this year's federal and provincial budgets.\u00a0\n\nNahanni Fontaine, Manitoba's minister for women and gender equity, said she has heard from community members who believe the alert system could help reduce risk for Indigenous women and girls.\u00a0\n\n\"We look forward to working inclusively with Indigenous partners in Manitoba to find the best path forward as we build this pilot project.\"\n\nCrown-Indigenous Relations Minister Gary Anandasangaree said Winnipeg \u2014 and Manitoba writ large \u2014 is the epicentre of the crisis, and launching the Red Dress Alert there will bring forward solutions that can be implemented across the country.\n\n\"It's not the only solution, but it's a critical starting point for us to address the immediate crisis that exists.\"\n\nGazan's efforts on the file led a House of Commons committee to study the prospect for a national alert system.\n\nHer fellow MPs unanimously backed her motion in the House of Commons last year declaring the deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls a Canada-wide emergency.\u00a0\n\nThe motion also called on the federal government to fund a new alert system that would operate much like Amber Alerts.\u00a0\n\nOther North American jurisdictions already have similar alert systems, including Washington state's Missing Indigenous Person system.\n\nThe national inquiry's 2019 final report found deliberate rights violations were at the heart of violence against Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse people.\n\nWith the final report came 231 calls to justice directed toward governments, social service providers, industry and Canadians, but relatively little progress has been made to date.\n\nSheila North, former grand chief of Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak and an ex-journalist, has been a vocal advocate in ending violence against Indigenous women.\n\nShe said that while news of an alert system is welcome, she hopes expectations are kept reasonable \u2014 at least for now.\n\n\"There's going to be bumps in the road \u2014 there's going to be challenges that maybe none of us see right now,\" she said. \"Inevitably, someone is going to be disappointed.\"\n\nBut it's the starting point that matters, she said. \"I think it's high time.\"\n\nTo those who may not see the value in an alert system for Indigenous women, North said people of that identity have been shut out of many parts of society \"for so long,\" and the deaths \"are a result of it.\"\n\nThe House of Commons committee studying the alert has heard testimony from experts who stress any system should be Indigenous-led.\n\nThat's in part to mitigate the problems of police inaction and bureaucratic red tape, so that members of the public are notified of a disappearance promptly and efficiently.\n\nJennifer Jesty, who serves as the resiliency manager for the Union of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq, spoke to MPs about her own efforts to get an emergency alert system running for her communities and attempts to minimize police interference.\n\nSince September 2020, Jesty told the committee in late March that she sent out 183 alerts and reunited 67 people with their families as a result \u2014 the vast majority of whom were brought back together with their families within an hour of the alert going out.\n\n\"Because this system was designed by us, for us, we were able to create our own protocols around when, how and why an alert should or shouldn\u2019t be sent,\" Jesty said.\n\n\"There has not been one single request for an alert that has been denied, and every single alert has been sent out within minutes of receiving the information.\"\n\nBack to Homepage\n\nTypos\nNews Tips\nForums\n\nMUST-READ STORIES\n\nGet all the day's most vital

THE CANADIAN PRESS/ Tijana Martin\nTara Deschamps\nThe Canadian Press\nStaff\nContact\nPublished Sept. 30, 2022 9:42 a.m. MDT\nShare\nTORONTO -\n\n Chelsee Pettit spent much of the summer collaborating with designers to create and manufacture apparel reflective of the Indigenous values she hoped would be on people's minds when Canada marks its second National Day for Truth and Reconciliation.\n\nBut in the days leading up to Sept. 30, she noticed many companies had not had the same forethought and were scrambling to place bulk orders with her store, Aaniin.\n\n\"It's just a little funny how last-minute other organizations that are all non-Indigenous are, and they're pushing that (work) back onto Indigenous people,\" said Pettit, an Anishinaabe woman.\n\n'Sadness and hope': Indigenous leaders, academics speak on Sept. 30 as commitments go unfulfilled\nCanadians reflect about residential schools on Truth and Reconciliation Day\nRacism blamed in death of man on Northern Ontario First Nation\nProvinces, territories face calls to make Day for Truth and Reconciliation a holiday\nNo single fix for anti-Indigenous racism in Canada's health-care system: doctor\nIndigenous leaders want corporate reconciliation efforts to extend beyond Sept. 30\nCanada Posts launches four stamps recognizing residential schools and reconciliation\nCanadian Museums Association recommends 10 ways to decolonize heritage sector\n'We shouldn't have to push people': Most provinces have not made Sept. 30 a stat holiday\nWhat each province, territory is doing on National Day for Truth and Reconciliation\nWhy it matters where you buy an orange shirt ahead of the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation\nYoung Indigenous leaders offer senators new ideas to mark National Day for Truth and Reconciliation\n\n\"We're not like big box stores that just have disposable T-shirts and are at everybody's beck and call. Working with us ahead of time as opposed to just laying it on us a week before the day, I think would be super helpful.\"\n\nPettit has tried her best to accommodate last-minute orders, but she and other members of the Indigenous business community see the trend as a sign of how much more work corporate Canada has to do to turn support for Indigenous communities into a 365-day-a-year effort.\n\nWhile many businesses encourage staff to don orange shirts -- a tradition started by residential school survivor Phyllis Webstad in 2013 -- or to sell wares in the bright hue on Sept. 30, those efforts quickly fade. Companies often don't do much more to elevate Indigenous voices and causes.\n\n\"It is positive that we are seeing education happen and awareness-building happen, but it can be quite triggering and harmful for Indigenous Peoples who see it as one day of performative action and nothing throughout the rest of the year,\" said Tabatha Bull, president and chief executive of the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business (CCAB).\n\nBull and Pettit say if an employer is looking to make a mark on truth and reconciliation goals, they should also be doing that work all year round.\n\nThose efforts should begin with educating staff about both long-standing and new traumas Indigenous Peoplesface and how to support those affected.\n\nPettit recallsbeing at work in 2021, when the remains of 215 children were found at a former residential school site in British Columbia.\n\n\"My boss at the time was like, 'Oh, well, everybody knew about that already' and just like kind of brushed it off, but I was feeling very emotional that day for obvious reasons, so there's tons of work that has to be done,\" she said.\n\nThat's borne out in studies too.\n\nA 2021 report from equity organization Catalyst Canada found about 52 per cent of the 86 Indigenous respondents surveyed are \"on guard\" at work and about 60 per cent feel psychologically unsafe on the job.\n\nThe study was based on a survey of 820 Canadian workers from various under-represented groups, but Catalyst isolated results from Indigenous respondents for this report because their need to feel on guard was so significant.\n\nKrystal Abotossaway, president of the Indigenous Professional Association of Canada, said she has seen more companies move toward reflecting on what they can do to improve their corporate culture and support Indigenous communities in recent years.\n\nLand acknowledgments, which note which Indigenous Peoples lived and took care of a site events are being held on, are an increasingly common and good start, she said.\n\nBull counts at least 200 companies, including Bank of Montreal, Uber, Walmart and Rogers, as members of the CCAB's Progressive Aboriginal Relation program -- an initiative helping them build cultural awareness and make progress on reconciliation plans.\n\nOthers have yet to take on such work. Bull thinks they're slower to act because they feel overwhelmed and afraid of having difficult conversations.\n\n\"Some corporations are just not even knowing what the right question is to ask,\" she said. \"I think we need to move beyond that, if we're going to really progress as a country.\"\n\nAbotossaway said they can start by marking other Indigenous days and use them as an opportunity to educate.\n\nAmong those she suggested are Red Dress Day, which commemorates the lives of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, and International Inuit Day, National Indigenous Peoples Day and Louis Riel Day, which celebrates the life of the late Metis leader.\n\nThe efforts shouldn't stop there, she added. Companies should reflect on how their governance structures, hiring policies, talent pipelines and workforce education programs align with Indigenous needs, she said.\n\n\"We've seen a lot of learning and development content come out, but that's usually just one course and it might be just an hour long,\" she said.\n\n\"Is it mandatory or is it not mandatory?

Her former partner, Kirk Keeping, has been charged in her death and is set for trial in 2024.\n\n\u201cIt was like a shock to my system,\u201d Denise said.\n\n\u201cEvery day you're woken up to the fact that they're no longer there, so I want to be able to honour all these women, in some way,\u201d she said.\n\nMi\u2019kmaq lawyer, author, and write Patricia Doyle-Bedwell says governments have been too slow in acting on the 231 Calls for Justice laid out in the final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\n\n\u201cAt least there's one day where people are talking about this, for a long time, nobody talked about it,\u201d she said, \u201c(but) the federal governments and the provincial governments are not making progress\u2026.I think they\u2019ve done two.\n\n\u201cWe still see the injustice and we have a missing and indigenous Mi\u2019kmaw woman in Halifax, Tanya Brooks, and her case hasn't been solved in ten years,\u201d she adds, \u201cI wonder what are they (police) doing? Why don't they care?\u201d\n\nWhile the House of Commons has unanimously declared the disappearances and deaths a national emergency, and has called for a new system to alert the public when an indigenous person goes missing, Doyle-Bedwell says the root causes of violence, such as lack of housing and healthcare, have not been fully addressed.\n\nAt the Halifax red dress event, John says she is frustrated by government inaction, but remains determined.\n\n\u201cA lot of work needs to be done still, and I have to be hopeful,\u201d she says, \u201cbut we're still going to be doing this, no matter what.\u201d\n\nRELATED IMAGES\n1 / 3\nMi\u2019kmaq lawyer, writer, and Dalhousie Unversity associate professor Patricia Doyle-Bedwell.\nReport an error\nEditorial standards & policies\nWhy you can trust CTV News\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nMUST WATCH\n\nHere's how the NHL playoffs boosted Canada's economy\n\nBest friends in N.B. recreate graduation pictures from 1984\n\nMassive sinkhole swallows part of soccer field in Illinois\n\n'Oh god, I'm gonna get hit': Driver clipped by airplane\n\nGiant basking shark spotted off eastern shore of Nova Scotia\n\nClothing store employees fight off armed robber in Toronto\n\nVideo shows bus smash into couple's vehicle in Windsor\n\nThieves smash truck through, rob adult toy store in Alta.\n\nOttawa 'fat cat' goes on unbelievable weight loss journey\n\nThis bus driver has been bringing kids to school since 1974\n\nWorkers left dangling from Toronto's St. Regis Hotel rescued\n\nWant to go cage diving with sharks in Atlantic Canada?\n\nOfficer rushes into burning home to save elderly couple\n\n19-year-old fights off shark after attack on Texas beach\n\nMoment fatal fire breaks out in South Korea factory\n\nHow you can manage the risks of West Nile Virus in Canada\n\nHiker stranded for 10 days in Calif. mountains speaks out\n\nQuestions raised about realtors using AI to sell homes\n\nTravis Kelce joins Taylor Swift on stage during London show\n\nATLANTIC TOP STORIES\nSteel officially cut for new Navy ships in Halifax\n'As I turned around, he lunged and grabbed me': Fredericton woman recovering after attack in parking lot\n\u2018I\u2019m terrified to go downtown again Halifax\u2019: woman recovering after altercation with group of men who allegedly made homophobic slurs\nWhat\u2019s happening and what\u2019s closed Canada Day weekend in the Maritimes\n75-year-old man charged with impaired driving in N.S. highway collision\nFour firearms missing after N.S. business break-in\n'Grand re-opening' of Officers' Square in Fredericton this long weekend\nAmherst, N.S., man charged for sexual offences against a child: RCMP\nTOP VIDEOS\n\nSame sex couple speaks out after being attacked\n\nFredericton attack leads to charges being laid\n\nOne accused in death of Halifax teenager on bail\n\nPolice investigating fatal hit and run in Truro\n\nWhat to expect for the Canada Day long weekend\n\nOfficer's Square in Fredericton reopening\n\nFirst steel cut for next generation Navy warships\n\nN.S. waiving tuition fee for paramedics\n\nNewfoundland-Argentina ferry seeing further delays\n\nBusiness summit in Saint Andrews wraps up\n\nEntertainment news this week with Katie Kelly\n\nLegal warnings coming to recover CERB payments\n\nHow car dealers are pushing to finance purchases\n\nMix of sun and cloud for Canada Day\n\nMaritime gas prices go up\n\nFrench president calls off visit to New Brunswick\n\nMacKinnon wins Hart Trophy, Ted Lindsay Award\n\nWhooping cough outbreak on Acadian Peninsula\n\nHMCS Sackville opens to public\n\nN.S. couple wins $500,000 from Atlantic Lottery\n\nCTVNEWS.CA TOP STORIES\n'We need new leadership': Liberal MP writes to caucus, says Justin Trudeau should resign\n\nA sitting Liberal MP has written to the federal caucus to say he thinks Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should resign.

I don't want to be forgotten,\" said Honey Flett, a Grade 10 student who was in the march.\n\n\"This was really overwhelming to see how many people decided to participate. I never expected so many.\"\n\nTara Tuchscherer, a teacher at St. James Collegiate, told CTV News the march is part of an entire week at the school meant to bring awareness to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, and raise funds for Drag the Red.\n\n\"A lot of people are unaware of the number of girls and women that are missing,\" Tuchscherer said. \"We don't know what happened to them and their families are having to take it upon themselves to look for them and they need closure.\"\n\nThe province, which is set to project a red dress on the Manitoba Legislative Building Thursday night, said it is an occasion to remember those tragically taken by gender-based violence and to honour the ongoing healing of survivors, their families and communities who have lost loved ones.\n\nTo mark the occasion, people are encouraged to wear red or hang red dresses and ribbons as a visual reminder of the lives lost and to raise awareness about the ongoing fight against gender-based violence.\n\nThe Stefanson government noted in a news release its 2021 commitment to address violence against Indigenous women and girls by introducing amendments to the Path to Reconciliation Act, which established calls for justice from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\n\n\u201cAddressing violence, in particular the incidences of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, is a priority for the province and it is our government's intent to continue to take action to prevent and combat gender-based violence of all forms,\u201d the province said in a news release.\n\nCITY TO HANG RED DRESSES, HOLD CEREMONIAL FIRE\n\nMeanwhile, the City of Winnipeg said it will mark the occasion with red dress displays at all Winnipeg Public Libraries until May 16.\n\nAdditionally, the city said it will host a ceremonial fire at Winnipeg City Hall from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m.\n\n\u201cWe would like to acknowledge the tireless heart-work of the MMIWG2S+ Advisory Committee, and Implementation Team for their guidance as we find our way to walk together to stop and prevent violence to Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+,\u201d the city wrote on its website.\n\nRELATED IMAGES\n1 / 2\nA group of students in Winnipeg marked the National Day of Awareness of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls by marching on May 5, 2022.

Traditional hand-drumming, an opening prayer, and an \u201chonour\u201d song and dance honouring those impacted by the MMIWG2S were in store at the arbor.\n\nThe walk was organized by the Lower Nicola Indian Band\u2019s (LNIB) Carole Basil, who says the community banded together to bring awareness to the ongoing MMIWG crisis.\n\n\u201cWe want to show support and awareness for the MMIWG2S,\u201d said Basil, who facilitates LNIB\u2019s Cultural Revitalization program. \u201cThere\u2019s been numerous MMIWG2S in our community and it\u2019s very heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nMultiple members of Merritt\u2019s RCMP were also in attendance, facilitating the traffic control as walk participants made their way to Shulus Arbor and showing their support for the event.\n\n\u201cI feel it\u2019s important for the police to participate and acknowledge our part in the history of colonization and the trauma.

The COVID-19 pandemic also created unprecedented challenges for victims and survivors seeking help and the frontline organizations that support them.\n\nToday, the Honourable Mona Fortier, President of the Treasury Board and Member of Parliament for Ottawa-Vanier, on behalf of the Honourable Marci Ien, Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth,\u00a0announced $750,000 in funding for Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada.\n\nIncreasing the capacity of Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada will provide Inuit-specific solutions to preventing and addressing gender-based violence, which will help Indigenous women, 2SLGBTQQIA+ people, and their communities prosper now and in the future.\n\nIn November 2022, the Federal, Provincial, and Territorial Forum of Ministers Responsible for the Status of Women launched the 10-year National Action Plan to End Gender-based Violence. This is a strategic framework for addressing gender-based violence. The National Action Plan includes five pillars:\u00a0support for victims, survivors, and their families; prevention; a responsive justice system; implementing Indigenous-led approaches; and social infrastructure and an enabling environment.\n\nQuote\n\n\"The high rates of violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQI+ people are alarming. Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada is doing critical work to prevent and address gender-based violence, and supporting these efforts remains a top priority for the Government of Canada. The funding announced today will help this organization build their capacity to address the root causes of gender-based violence and continue to build prosperous Inuit communities. This Friday, May 5, we mark Red Dress Day, which reminds us to uphold and honour the memory and spirits of all missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls (MMIWG) as well as Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and additional sexually and gender-diverse (2SLGBTQI+) people.\"\n\nThe Honourable Mona Fortier, President of the Treasury Board and Member of Parliament for Ottawa-Vanier\n\nQuick facts\nThis funding is part of the approximately $601.3 million that the Government of Canada committed through Budget 2021 to increase efforts to end gender-based violence.\nThis announcement builds on previous Women and Gender Equality Canada funding of over $13 million for more than 100 commemoration projects to help honour the lives and legacies of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people.\nThe National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence, particularly Pillar 4, supports Indigenous-led approaches. The National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence is aligned with and complements the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People National Action Plan, and the Federal Pathway to Address Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People (Federal Pathway).\nThe Federal Pathway is the Government of Canada's contribution to the 2021 Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People National Action Plan: Ending Violence Against Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People. It outlines the Government of Canada's efforts, now and in the future, to end the gender-based violence and systemic racism responsible for missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people.\nA recent study by Statistics Canada indicates that while only 5% of the female population in Canada identified as Indigenous in 2021, 21% of all gender-related homicides involved Indigenous women and girls.\nAssociated links\nNational Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence\nNews release \u2013 Call for proposals: Indigenous women and 2SLGBTQQIA+ organizations to further address gender-based violence\nFederal Pathway to Address Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People\n\nFollow Women and Gender Equality Canada:\n\nWebsite\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nInstagram\nYouTube\n\nSOURCE Women and Gender Equality Canada\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

They're present 24 hours a day, in all weather, to draw attention to the plight of missing and murdered indigenous women who experience violence at a higher rate than non-indigenous women.\n\nShare\n\n Print\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0\n\nForty red dresses hang outside of the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, a short distance from the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThey\u2019re strategically placed near trees and waterfalls alongside the Riverwalk located in the museum\u2019s Native landscape.\n\nThey\u2019re present 24 hours a day, in all weather, to draw attention to the plight of missing and murdered indigenous women who experience violence at a much higher rate than non-indigenous women.\n\nOn this day, they snap furiously in a wicked wind, commanding attention.\n\nThe powerful installation is the creative brainchild of visual artist Jaime Black, whose goal is to raise awareness about the high rate of violence against native women.\n\n\u201cWhat I do is I put up empty red dresses in public spaces so that people can connect to the absence of these women, but also to the power and presence of the women through the red dress,\u201d she says.\n\nThe color red\n\nHer choice of the color red was deliberate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our sacred life blood, it\u2019s where vitality comes from, and our energy, and our power as human beings, but it\u2019s also an allusion to the violence and the loss of that sacred life blood through violence,\u201d she says.\n\nPaying homage\n\nOn this freezing day outside the museum, Black honors the women the dresses represent \u2014 with a special performance.\n\nAs a Native American elder beats on a drum, the artist, barefoot and all in black except for a red silk scarf around her neck, kneels and rubs clay on the ground near the entrance to the museum. It\u2019s been raining hard all morning. But it stops as Black starts her performance.\n\nSpectators gather round as she clutches her pot of clay and walks slowly toward the dresses. She winds her way around the ledge of a curved pool and wades into the cool water, smearing some of the dresses with the mudlike substance.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to use my talents and my gifts to further the voices of a lot of people who are silenced,\u201d she says, \u201cand indigenous women are really facing this epidemic of silence.\u201d\n\nWhile Black\u2019s work has focused mostly on Canadian women so far, she\u2019s brought her project to the U.S. for the first time, to address an issue that spans the entire Western hemisphere.\n\nREDress project\n\nShe calls her installation \u201cThe REDress Project,\u201d or \u201cThe re-dress project.\u201d\n\n\u201cRedress is a word that means to put right a wrong, and indigenous women have been facing injustice in North America for hundreds of years,\u201d she says. \u201cEver since settlers came to North America, there\u2019s been a violent relationship between settlers and indigenous people and I feel like that violent relationship carries on still today.\u201d\n\nShe calls that systemic discrimination, The Colonial Project.\n\n\u201cThe Colonial Project is basically interested in erasing certain voices in favor of a certain system,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo the legal frameworks, the political frameworks, these things were built by non-indigenous people to silence indigenous people, and so all of these systems have created a space where indigenous women are erased.\u201d\n\nBut more and more Native women are refusing to be silenced and are becoming proactive, leading movements, participating in protests and petitioning their governments for more recognition.\n\n\u201cI think in these ways and these movements, like Standing Rock and Idle No More movement, we see the strength of indigenous women to really maintain culture in the face of such colonial violence,\u201d Black says.\n\nHope for change\n\nBlack \u2014 and other supporters, including Machel Monenerkit, deputy director of the museum \u2014 are also encouraged by the presence of two Native American women in Congress now; Debra Anne Haaland, serving as the U.S. Representative for New Mexico\u2019s 1st congressional district, and Sharice Lynnette Davids, serving as the U.S. Representative for Kansas\u2019s 3rd congressional district.\n\n\u201cI think the 2019 Congress for women was exceptional in the numbers that we now have in Congress, but for Native people having two indigenous women represent Kansas and New Mexico is obviously something we\u2019ve not seen before, and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to bring attention to Native issues,\u201d Monenerkit says.\n\nIn the meantime, Black hopes the red dresses, all of which are donated, will have an impact on all who get to see them.\n\n\u201cWhat I think that the artwork and creativity can really do is really hit people in the heart, \u201cshe says. \u201cPeople who walk by those dresses \u2026 they can\u2019t unsee that. That\u2019s going to sit in their memory for a very long time, and I think it has a really emotional impact on people even before they know what the dresses are even there for.\u201d\n\nMore Art & Culture News\nTrafficked Cambodian artifacts returned from US\nFrance's renowned Arles photo fest goes 'beneath the surface'\nWhat was the 'first American novel'?

I wanted to take a moment, though, to write to you all directly to reflect on the year so far \u2013 the end of my first year here at Waterloo \u2013 and what lies ahead.\n\u00a0\nThis June has been filled with wonderful opportunities to celebrate our community. At the heart of our celebrations was the largest Convocation we have ever seen. From June 11 to June 18, we celebrated alongside a total of 8,320 graduates and 18,522 guests in person here in Waterloo.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe owe an enormous thank you to the people who made it possible to welcome back graduands and alumni from 2020, 2021 and 2022. More than 350 employees from across our campus communities came together with 200 student ushers, and another 275 volunteers to make this Convocation truly a once-in-a-lifetime event.\n\u00a0\nFor so many people, Convocation was amongst the first opportunities we have had to connect in person with our friends and colleagues. The events really brought the campus alive and I know our students appreciate the return to in person experiences. The connections and communities that we develop on our campuses and beyond are the foundation of a positive student experience and what makes the University of Waterloo so special.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis month we have also celebrated Pride and National Indigenous History month. I am so pleased that our students from the GLOW centre were able to attend Toronto\u2019s Pride March on Sunday. And if you haven\u2019t had an opportunity to attend one of the many Indigenous events on campus this month, I encourage you to attend\u00a0Bmaadziwin: An Indigenous Perspective of Life\u00a0later today to learn from Elder Myeengun Henry.\n\u00a0\nAs we reach the Canada Day long weekend, I hope the day away from the University gives you an opportunity to rest and relax. No matter how you mark the day, I encourage you to celebrate how diverse communities and individuals add richness and vibrancy to our campuses and Canadian society. We can also reflect on how we can do better to break down barriers for marginalized voices, and work toward Truth and Reconciliation.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs I approach the end of my first year at Waterloo, I\u2019m reflecting on what I have heard in the many consultations and conversations I have had as part of the Waterloo at 100 project. I have heard your motivation to think about the longer-term future for Waterloo, your openness to working in new ways and your pride in our institution. I\u2019m grateful for your input and look forward to sharing more with you in the Fall. Until then, you can continue to\u00a0share your perspectives and stay up to date with the project online.\n\u00a0\nI do hope that over the next couple of months you will make some time for you, your friends, family and loved ones. \u00a0Thank you for everything you do for the University of Waterloo.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHave a great summer.\u00a0I look forward to seeing you all on campus this Fall.\n\nNew course alert: the Wicked Problem of Climate Change\n\nA message from GSPA.\n\nIn winter 2023 a\u00a0pilot, interdisciplinary undergraduate course will be taught by a group of\u00a0doctoral candidates from the University of Waterloo. It will focus on the Wicked Problem\u00a0of Climate Change and will provide undergraduate students with a classroom experience where the academic content spans disciplinary boundaries.\n\nThe team will spend the fall 2022 term designing the course by working with each other and with mentors in the Beta Teaching Innovation Incubator (up to 10 hours a week, equivalent to a TAship).\n\nPhD candidates researching in the area of climate change are invited to apply for this pilot. The intention is to select up to six doctoral student researchers, with diverse representation from across the faculties.\u00a0 For more information, visit\u00a0The Wicked Problem of Climate Change course web page. The deadline to apply\u00a0is July 12.\n\nPlanting the seeds of reconciliation\n\nBy Eugenia Xenos Anderson.\u00a0This article was originally featured on Waterloo News.\n\nEven before the commitment was made on paper and then solidified in ceremony, talk of Indigenous reconciliation had been taking place in the University of Waterloo\u2019s\u00a0Faculty of Health. However, it took the hire of an Indigenous Knowledge Keeper to give shape to a process that is sometimes not well understood and often difficult to begin.\n\nThat Indigenous Knowledge Keeper is\u00a0Elder Myeengun Henry, formerly\u00a0Chief of the Chippewas of the Thames First Nation\u00a0and Indigenous leader at Conestoga College. His voice is soothing but forceful, and he looks like a man who has found his calling. Part grandfather, part sage, part friendly neighbour, he is a healer who came to Waterloo at just the right time.\u00a0\n\nElder Henry is at a stage in his life where he wants to share his knowledge, experiences, language and culture. He wants to\u00a0offset the damage of more than one hundred years when Indigenous culture, identity and languages were stifled, prohibited and criminalized. He tirelessly spreads the word through learning circles, ceremonies and even attending every single one of the 20 convocation ceremonies this spring. He does it patiently and cheerfully, but also pointedly when necessary.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe had to have a starting point,\u201d said Elder Henry at the Faculty of Health\u2019s inaugural Commitment Ceremony this week. In this case, the starting point was the inclusion of a signature commitment to create \u201can environment that invites and respects Indigenous ways of knowing\u201d in the Faculty\u2019s latest strategic plan, made formal by the ceremony.\n\n\u201cThe vision was there, so today we make that full commitment by planting a cedar tree as a point of celebration,\u201d he said. He and Dean Lili Liu also exchanged gifts: a sacred eagle feather for the Faculty, and a one-of-a-kind beaded medallion for Elder Henry. They also unveiled a Wampum Belt that will hang in the Health Expansion building.\n\n\u201cI am overwhelmed by the support and love I\u2019ve felt since I came to help build this up,\u201d Henry says. \u201cI know there is honour and respect of Indigenous people in this Faculty. We\u2019ll find our struggles now and then and have differences of opinion, but I think overall, our commitment is here and is strong.\u00a0\n\nThe feeling is mutual. Dean Lili Liu is grateful for the leadership and counsel Elder Henry is providing. \u201cNot only has Elder Henry shared deep knowledge and wonderful ideas for how to help make our spaces and actions more inviting and welcoming, but he has quickly become a part of our\u00a0Faculty\u00a0family.\u201d\n\nWhile the Faculty\u2019s reconciliation efforts have started with events such as a Red Dress Day commemoration and the Commitment Ceremony, they are also creating spaces that can be used by Indigenous students and others, installing Indigenous artwork to make students feel comfortable and accepted,\u00a0and including Indigenous knowledge into the curriculum to make a difference in how we practice and deliver health programs and services.\n\n\u201cGive students a place to congregate, celebrate, smudge and be proud to be an Indigenous student in the Faculty of Health,\u201d Elder Henry says. \u201cI see a vision coming true, a formal commitment to making this come true. It will be longer than the life of a strategic plan.\u201d\n\nOf course, there is good reason Elder Henry is motivated to teach about Indigenous history and culture: \u201cWe did ceremonies on this land. We walked this land and we fed our families on this land. It\u2019s important for Indigenous people to know that we are still here.\u201d\n\nYou can hear more from Elder Henry on the\u00a0Beyond the Bulletin podcast\u00a0where he shares his goals and motivation as he approaches his work at Waterloo.\n\nQ and A with the experts: Reclaiming Indigenous histories\n\nThis article was originally featured on Waterloo News.\n\nDuring National Indigenous History Month and as we celebrate National Indigenous Peoples Day on June 21, University of Waterloo historian and anthropologist\u00a0Talena Atfield\u00a0answers questions about the recovery and regeneration of Indigenous artifacts, practices and knowledges. Professor Atfield is a member of the\u00a0Kanien'keh\u00e1:ka Nation of the Six Nations of the Grand River.\n\nWhat do people need to understand about the repatriation and preservation of Indigenous histories and artifacts?\n\nI believe that people should learn how and why Indigenous museum and archival collections were made, the impacts these practices continue to have on communities, and why repatriation can be an important tool for conciliation and healing. Most collections were built on agendas of extermination, land theft, the erasure of Indigenous presence, and literally, on Indigenous physical bodies. The perpetuation of anti-Indigenous sentiments, such as a hierarchical scale of human evolution, in which European settlers were at the top and Indigenous Peoples worldwide occupied various stages below, enabled land theft and resource extraction. This was further supported through pseudoscientific practices that boasted the ability to determine levels of intelligence and moral character through skeletal morphologies, which were used to argue Indigenous peoples had not reached the pinnacle of human evolution.\n\nThese ideas were combined with the false notion of the \u201cvanishing race,\u201d which posited that \u201cauthentic\u201d or \u201creal\u201d Indigenous people only existed in a \u201cpure\u201d and \u201cuncontaminated\u201d past. Contact with European colonizers resulted in outside influences that doomed \u201creal\u201d Indigenous Peoples to extinction. This, in turn, enabled the widescale extraction of Indigenous material cultures and promoted the erasure of Indigenous presence and contributions to what is now Canada. This extraction en masse saw the removal of items essential to the continuation of some spiritual and ceremonial practices. Many Indigenous individuals and communities are still trying to recover and regenerate knowledges and practices that were affected by these histories. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nHow is intangible Indigenous knowledges preserved?\n\nHodinohso:ni people have continued to preserve intangible knowledges through stories, oral histories, and mnemonic devices such as wampum. Stories are a rich source of information, and the act of storytelling and listening to stories has played an integral role in teaching generations of Hodinohso:ni people what it means to be Hodinohso:ni. Intangible knowledges are also preserved in language, Hodinohso:ni languages are rich with information detailing how ideas or objects fit into Hodinohso:ni ethos; much of this information becomes lost in translation, which is why it is so important to support and promote Indigenous language initiatives.\n\nWhat is the most pressing work yet to be done to preserve and share Indigenous histories?\u00a0\n\nMaking collections accessible to the communities from which they originated would be very impactful. Currently, there are archives full of audio recordings, photographs, and detailed field notes, as well as storage rooms full of material culture, much of which has not been available to the community since it was taken over 100 years ago. Many communities and individuals don\u2019t know how or where to find information related to these collections or how to access them. Items are located all over the world, everywhere but where they are needed most. The most pressing work, in my opinion, is ensuring that institutions have adequate funds and staff to carry out digitization and dissemination of this archival information, as well as decentralizing of the collections back to home communities where possible, so information that has been extracted from communities can be regenerated into practice.\n\nHow can people support repatriation, preservation, and knowledge sharing?\n\nI recommend people learn Indigenous histories, on the land they occupy, at the very least. There is incredible diversity within and among Indigenous Nations in what is now Canada. Until recently, Indigenous perspectives and narratives have been entirely absent from the Canadian curriculum. This has played a large role in perpetuating violence against Indigenous peoples. I recommend people attend appropriate cultural events, learn the history of the treaties \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 in the areas they live and visit, take courses, and read Indigenous-authored books. There are so many free digital learning opportunities available that uplift Indigenous Peoples' voices from across Canada that people could engage.\n\nEngineering's Elder in Residence offers courses and counselling grounded in his Indigenous background\n\nBy Carol Truemner. This is an exceprt of an article\u00a0originally featured on Waterloo News.\n\nPassionate about\u00a0sharing his Indigenous heritage, an adjunct architecture professor named a\u00a0new course after the ceremony his ancestors have used for thousands of years to welcome visitors to their homeland \u2014 At the Woods Edge.\n\nThis semester,\u00a0William Woodworth, also known as Elder Bill, started teaching the course focused\u00a0on the relationships between Indigenous peoples and settlers from the 16th century to today, and how those associations have affected both engineering and architecture.\n\nWoodworth\u2019s offering draws, in part, on his background as a member of the Lower Mohawk Kanien'keh\u00e1:ka Nation of Six Nations of the Grand River in the Bear Clan.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, he had the opportunity to\u00a0apprentice\u00a0with Cayuga Chief Jacob Ezra Thomas Deyohonwedah of the Six Nations of the Grand River Territory where he was immersed in the Haudenosaunee practices and culture.\n\nBorn in the United States, Woodworth completed an architecture degree at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\n\nBuilding on his architectural education, he launched William Woodworth Architect in Toronto in 1980 and practiced as a member of the Ontario Association of Architects, and the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada.\n\n\u00a0In 1993, he took a sabbatical to teach at the Lawrence Technological University outside of Detroit. From there, he began doctoral studies at the California Institute of Integral Studies in the program Recovery of the Indigenous mind and graduated in 2001.\n\nRead the rest of the article on Waterloo News.\n\nWhat's open and closed this weekend\n\nThe University will be closed on Friday, July 1 for Canada Day.

Read our\u00a0privacy policy\n\nThousands of Canadian women and girls were murdered or disappeared over nearly half a century in a \u201cgenocide\u201d, according to a leaked report of a government inquiry.\n\nIndigenous females face disproportionate violence largely because of \u201cstate actions and inactions rooted in colonialism and colonial ideologies\u201d, the document states.\n\nRights groups have for decades pointed to cases of women and girls vanishing or being killed. A study by the National Institute of Justice found 84 per cent of Native American and Alaska native women have experienced violence in their lifetime and more than half have endured the violence at the hands of an intimate partner.\n\nThe inquiry report, due out on Monday but seen in advance by CBC News, says: \u201cWe do know that thousands of indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA (two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, queer, questioning, intersex and asexual) people have been lost to the Canadian genocide to date.\u201d\n\nIt adds: \u201cThe fact that First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis peoples are still here and that the population is growing should not discount the charge of genocide.\u201d\n\nMurdered and missing indigenous women in US and Canada\nShow all 11\n\nThe report, entitled \u201cReclaiming Power and Place\u201d, says that \u201cdue to the gravity of this issue,\u201d the inquiry is preparing a \u201csupplementary report on the Canadian genocide of indigenous peoples according to the legal definition of genocide,\u201d which will be posted at a later date on the inquiry website, CBC News reported.\n\nRunning to over 1,200 pages it carries at least 230 recommendations.\n\nIt comes after two and a half years of work by the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls, ordered by Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister.\n\nEstimates have put the number of indigenous women and girls who have disappeared or been murdered in Canada since the 1970s at up to 4,000, but the inquiry report says the true number may be impossible to establish.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2010, the Sisters In Spirit Initiative said it confirmed 582 cases of missing and/or murdered indigenous women and girls over 20 years.\n\nThe murder of 15-year-old Tina Fontaine in the summer of 2014 gave fresh impetus to calls for a national inquiry. By 2015, the UN backed a public inquiry.\n\nTo produce the new report, the inquiry held 24 sessions, attended by at least 2,380 people, including family members of those killed or missing.\n\nThe missing and murdered indigenous women (MMIW) issue involves indigenous people in Canada and the US, including the First Nations, Inuit, M\u00e9tis and Native American communities.\n\nSupport free-thinking journalism and attend Independent events\n\nThe inquiry website says: \u201cShining a light on all the causes of violence, murders and disappearances is a daunting task. But it is a necessary one. We are exposing hard truths about the devastating impacts of colonisation, racism and sexism \u2013 aspects of Canadian society that many Canadians are reluctant to accept.\u201d\n\nRobert Pickton, one of the world\u2019s most notorious serial killers, who was jailed in 2007, said he butchered 49 women at his farm near Vancouver.\n\nIt was claimed that police had not taken the disappearances seriously because the women were sex workers and mostly from Canada\u2019s indigenous community.\n\nThe death in 1971 of Helen Betty Osborne, 19, a Cree Aboriginal woman who was abducted and murdered in the street in Manitoba, prompted the wave of campaigning that finally culminated in the inquiry\u2019s launch.\n\nIn her wake came thousands of cases of deaths and disappearances that activists say were not properly investigated.\n\nThey range from the deaths of Gloria Moody, 27, in 1969 to that of 14-year-old Aielah Saric-Auger in 2006. The Sisters in Spirit movement published a report in 2009 of the personal stories of the women and girls.\n\nCBC News has a database of 308 cases, including 66 since 2019.\n\nMore aboutCanadaNative AmericansmurderJustin Trudeau\nJoin our commenting forum\n\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\n\nComments\nMost Popular\nGeneral election - live: Huge voter turnout at polls today\nGeneral election results: When will key seats be announced tonight?\nGoFundMe for Stormy Daniels tops $800k after she reveals threats faced\nJay Slater could have survived \u2018drinking rainwater\u2019, investigator says\nPaedophile teacher caught smirking buying teenage victim Gucci belt\nPopular videos\nEd Davey casts vote in general election: \u2018Lovely day isn\u2019t it?\u2019\nCount Binface promises 99 ice creams to remain 99p in election plea\nMiriam Margolyes causes chaos as she swears live on Loose Women\nSponsored Features\nGET IN TOUCH\nContact us\nOUR PRODUCTS\nSubscribe\nRegister\nNewsletters\nToday\u2019s Edition\nInstall our app\nArchive\nOTHER PUBLICATIONS\nInternational editions\nIndependent en Espa\u00f1ol\nIndependent Arabia\nIndependent Turkish\nIndependent Persian\nIndependent Urdu\nEvening Standard\nEXTRAS\nAdvisor\nPuzzles\nAll topics\nBetting Offers\nVoucher codes\nCompetitions and offers\nIndependent Advertising\nIndependent Ignite\nSyndication\nWorking at The Independent\nLEGAL\nCode of conduct and complaints\nContributors\nCookie policy\nPrivacy notice\nUser policies\nModern Slavery Act"},

For 14 years, the SaskParty has put First Nations and M\u00e9tis issues on the back burner, or they use them to divide Saskatchewan people to score cheap political points.\u201d said NDP MLA Betty Nippi-Albright.\n\nSaskatchewan RCMP said officers are currently investigating 27 open cases of Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls, adding each case in equally important.\n\nThe province says it has taken action on addressing gender-based violence through ending birth alerts earlier this year and funding First Nations and M\u00e9tis projects. \u201cIn December of 2020, we announced $400,000 for the First Nation and M\u00e9tis projects to finish focus on issues raised by that National Inquiry,\u201d explained Social Services Minister Lori Carr, who answered in the Legislature Wednesday as Minister of Government Relations, Minister Responsible for First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Northern Affairs Don McMorris was absent.\n\nHowever, the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations is seeking greater investment for services to women in need.\n\n\u201cThe number of women and families being turned away from emergency shelters because they are at full capacity, heightened food insecurities, as well as inadequate housing are compounding factors that are maintaining high levels of violence and persistent hardships\u201d Vice Chief Bear said.\u00a0 \u201cAs leaders and government agencies, we must ensure there is adequate supports during and after this pandemic.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Missinipi Broadcasting Corporation | Site Design by Answers IT Consulting | Powered by WordPress"},

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick\n\nThe head of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada says it\u2019s clear there's an ongoing emergency nearly four years after the final report into missing and murdered Indigenous woman and girls was released.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe are in a crisis,\u201d said Carol McBride.\u00a0\n\nRed\u00a0dresses are set\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0on display across the country Friday\u00a0to\u00a0recognize the National\u00a0Day\u00a0of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People. It has become known\u00a0as\u00a0Red\u00a0Dress\u00a0Day\u00a0and the empty garments serve\u00a0as\u00a0a symbol of lives that have been lost.\n\nEach year there are\u00a0more\u00a0events, rallies and art displays. Despite the increased awareness and an extensive national inquiry, McBride said the situation that Indigenous girls and women face has not substantially changed.\n\n\u201cI'm a mother. I'm a sister. I'm an aunt,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I'm just imagining some of our families and our women are suffering right now.\u201d\n\nThe inquiry\u2019s final report was released in 2019 and included sweeping calls for change. It found Indigenous women and girls are 12 times\u00a0more\u00a0likely\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0murdered or go missing than any other group in Canada.\u00a0\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau accepted the findings of the inquiry, which said the crisis amounted\u00a0to\u00a0genocide.\n\nSixty-three per cent of Indigenous women have experienced violence and nearly half have experienced sexual assault, Statistics Canada said in a report last year.\u00a0\n\nWinnipeg has been called ground zero.\n\nAt least 28 Indigenous women in Manitoba have died due\u00a0to\u00a0violence since May 2020, said Sandra DeLaronde, team lead for the Manitoba MMIWG2S+ implementation team. The majority were in Winnipeg.\u00a0\n\nA group hung 101\u00a0red\u00a0dresses along a chain-link fence outside a landfill in the Manitoba capital over the winter. Winnipeg police have said the bodies of four Indigenous women were disposed of in landfills last year.\u00a0\n\nThe remains of three of the women have not been found. A man has been charged with first-degree murder in the killings of the four women.\n\nThe remains of another Indigenous woman were also found in a landfill earlier this year. Police said her death is not a homicide.\u00a0\n\n\"When I think (about it), I cry,\" DeLaronde said. \"I have\u00a0to\u00a0focus on the thousands of women and girls that are still here and how we can keep them safe.\"\n\nDeLaronde said it's important\u00a0to\u00a0recognize that Indigenous people are sacred, and they should not only\u00a0be\u00a0honoured\u00a0when they are gone.\n\nThe House of Commons unanimously backed a motion Tuesday declaring the deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls a Canada-wide emergency. It also called for funding a new system\u00a0to\u00a0alert the public when someone goes missing.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe truth is the truth,\u201d said Leah Gazan, the Winnipeg member of Parliament who presented the motion. \u201cIt's one thing\u00a0to\u00a0acknowledge truth. It's another thing\u00a0to\u00a0act on it.\u201d\n\nThe Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada has criticized the federal government for not doing\u00a0more\u00a0or acting fast enough. McBride said Tuesday\u2019s motion was an important step, but there is\u00a0more\u00a0to\u00a0do.\n\nMost of the money announced\u00a0to\u00a0fulfil the inquiry's 231 calls\u00a0to\u00a0justice became stuck in government bureaucracy, DeLaronde said, and it has not made it\u00a0to\u00a0the front lines and the Indigenous women and families who need it.\n\nDeLaronde added that all Canadians should use\u00a0Red\u00a0Dress\u00a0Day\u00a0to\u00a0reflect on what they can do\u00a0to\u00a0create change.\u00a0\n\n\"Red\u00a0Dress\u00a0is a movement that people can get behind, because it's an opportunity\u00a0to\u00a0transform the very fabric of this country.\"\n\nNEXT STORY\nEntire town of Drayton Valley ordered to evacuate due to wildfire\nLATEST IN NATIONAL NEWS\nCanadians feel grocery inflation getting worse, 18% are boycotting Loblaw: poll\nFreeland says capital gains proposal will be tabled before summer break\nCivil society at \u2018high risk\u2019 of cyberthreats from state-sponsored actors: CSE\n'It came from the sky': Saskatchewan farmer finds hunk of space junk in field\nLATEST STORIES ON OKOTOKSONLINE\nTown of Okotoks announces 19 new murals and the artists behind them\nBear warning issued for Kananaskis Golf course as camping opens up across Alberta\nThe Venue released the Summer Series and Bandstand Sunday's lineups\nTown of Okotoks calls on locals to name three snowplows\nEvents\nLittle Women The Broadway Musical\nFri, Jul 5, 12:00 AM\nGranary Road After Hours (in July)\nFri, Jul 5, 9:00 AM\nThe Fever by Wallace Shawn\nFri, Jul 5, 9:46 AM\nMillarville Farmers Market\nSat, Jul 6, 9:00 AM\nFoothills Family Expo\nSat, Jul 6, 9:00 AM\nView more \nJobs\nPowered by\nAccount Manager\nFull-time, Permanent, Professionals, Sales\nSales Manager\nFull-time, Permanent, Professionals, Sales\nMechanic Apprentice and Tire Technician\nEntry-Level, Labour, Retail, Skilled Trades, Technology, Full-time\nView more \nThe Eagle 100.9\nPodcasts\nGet the App\nNEWS\nLocal News\nNational News\nCommunity\nAg News\nLocal Sports\nSponsored\nWeather\nFEATURES\nEvents\nLocalJobShop\nGarage Sales\nRoad Reports and Cancellations\nCONTESTS\nRam Everyday Adventure\nCONNECT\nContact Us\nSubmit News\nMeet the Team\nFacebook\nInstagram\nX\nYouTube\nStreaming\nRSS\nAdvertise With Us\nCareers\nContest Rules\nAccessibility\nTerms Of Use Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\nJournalistic Standards"},

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n\nNo one knows how many Native American women and girls are missing and murdered each year. Yet everyone concedes there is a crisis, a \u201chidden epidemic,\u201d as former Democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota has called it. Although the federal government keeps data on virtually everything, it does not collect statistics on missing and murdered Native women and girls. It has no national database where tribes can report such crimes, no way for families or tribal investigators to seek information.\n\n\u201cThe problem has been going on for hundreds of years with little or no intervention by the federal government,\u201d Sarah Deer, a professor of women, gender, and sexuality studies at the University of Kansas, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s getting attention now, but the problem is not new.\u201d\n\nEven without exact numbers, the statistics that do exist on the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women\u2019s (MMIW) crisis are staggering. In 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s National Crime Information Center (NCIC), which tracks missing persons, pegged the total number of missing Native American and Alaska Native women and girls at 5,712. Yet this figure was undoubtedly low. Only 116 of these reports were logged into the Department of Justice\u2019s federal missing persons\u2019 database, a resource that allows law enforcement agencies to share information.\n\nAlthough the 2015 Tribal Access Program (TAP) was supposed to effect tribes\u2019 access to NCIC, that has been slow to happen. As of 2019, only 47 of the 573 federally recognized tribes in the United States were participating. That lack of access, due in part to the costs of updating computers, is critical. It means that many crimes go unreported, and tribal investigators who are called to a crime scene have a limited ability to pull up information on potential suspects. As a result, many cases go uninvestigated, unsolved.\n\nLEILA NAVIDI/STAR TRIBUNE VIA AP\nMissy Jackson, 23, of Minneapolis, attends a prayer circle for Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, who was abducted and killed in 2017 near Fargo, North Dakota. People wore green ribbons to honor Savanna, her favorite color.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nThe cost isn\u2019t supposed to be a hurdle. The US Crime Victims Fund, a pot of billions of dollars drawn entirely from fines and penalties incurred by offenders, is intended to make resources available to local police forces for computer updates. It is also, significantly, supposed to pay for rehabilitation and preventive services, for victim compensation, and for victim services.\n\nBut every year tribes have had to fight for their share, mostly because they rely on states to disperse the money. According to a Department of Justice report released in 2017, \u201cfrom 2010 through 2014, state governments passed only 0.5 percent of the available funds to programs serving tribal victims, leaving a significant unmet need in most tribal communities.\u201d\n\nNationally, Native women are more than twice as likely to be raped or sexually assaulted as any other group of females in the country.\n\nEven those tribes with access to the NCIC database frequently don\u2019t enter records. Native advocates say that a lack of staff is part of the problem. But there\u2019s also a deeper, historical reason for the absence of reliable data. Distrust of law enforcement, fear they won\u2019t be believed, that nothing will result, ensure many Native women and girls don\u2019t report. The result is a climate of such pervasive unpunished crime that it is difficult to comprehend. In 2016, a report from the National Institute of Justice painted a jarring picture of this violence. Nationally, Native women are more than twice as likely to be raped or sexually assaulted as any other group of females in the country. On some reservations, Native women are murdered at more than ten times the national average. Nearly one in three Native American and Alaska Native women will experience rape or attempted rape in her lifetime. Native women also suffer intolerably high rates of physical violence\u201490 percent of it committed by non-Native intimate partners.\n\nThe reasons for this singular violence against Native women are complex. But they amount to, in essence, a level of racism so ancient and entrenched in America that it continues to poison how Native women are perceived today\u2014as inferior exotic beings, as sexualized objects. \u201cWe\u2019re targeted for who we are, what we represent, as Indian women and our sovereign nation,\u201d Lisa Brunner, a member of the White Earth Ojibwe Nation, and co-director of the Indigenous Women\u2019s Human Rights Collective, Inc., told me.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take much to conjure an example of this racist mentality. It saturates American culture, from fashion to sports, to seemingly benign childhood rituals like Halloween, when young non-Native women mindlessly don Pocahontas costumes. Native advocates with decades of experience helping victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and sex trafficking have found these stereotypes to be not just offensive but exceedingly dangerous. \u201cOftentimes we get romanticized,\u201d Brunner, who has repeatedly testified before Congress on the need to pass meaningful legislation to protect Native women and girls, said to me. \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret plays a role in that. When you have models going down the runway wearing headdresses, it continues to foster that romanticism and increases the level of violence perpetuated against us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\nARTUR WIDAK/NURPHOTO VIA GETTY//GETTY IMAGES\nHundreds of women participated in the annual Red Dress Day march in downtown Edmonton, to commemorate the lives of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls across Canada.\n\nThe crisis is also inextricably tied to the confusing matrix of laws governing Indian Country. \u201cIt is often perceived as easier to \u2018get away\u2019 with certain crimes on reservations because there is a lack of tribal policing and lack of tribal jurisdiction,\u201d Cheryl Redhorse Bennett, an assistant professor of American Indian Studies at Arizona State University, told me. Although reservations are sovereign nations, the 1978 Supreme Court case Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe stripped tribes of their authority to punish non-Natives on tribal lands. This means that federal, tribal, and state agencies split jurisdiction. So when a crime occurs, it can be baffling to deter- mine who is supposed to be leading the investigation.\n\n\nSay a Native woman is sexually assaulted. Where did it happen? On the reservation or off? If her attacker is Native and it occurred on the reservation, then tribal police and courts have jurisdiction. If her attacker is non-Native, then the FBI or state investigates. If she is assaulted off the reservation, the state is supposed to act.\n\n\nAs for felonies like murder, rape, and kidnapping, if they happen on tribal lands, the Department of Justice is supposed to prosecute. But the reality is the agency often doesn\u2019t. In recent years, the Department of Justice has pursued prosecution in only about half of murder cases on reservations and in a little over a third of cases of sexual assault. In 2017, under mounting pressure to address this crisis, the department still declined more than one-third of the cases referred to them by reservation authorities.\n\nIndigenous women who are missing or murdered disappear not just once, but three times: \u201cin life, in the media, in the data.\u201d\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nBut what of Native women and girls who go missing in American cities? More than 70 percent of American Indian and Alaska Natives live in urban enclaves, where crimes are investigated by local law enforcement authorities. Still, no one knows how many Native women and girls have disappeared or been murdered in cities in the United States, because there\u2019s been little effort by police departments or other law enforcement agencies to keep track.\n\nIn 2018, Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Health Institute (UIHI) in Seattle, and Annita Lucchesi, a doctoral intern at the UIHI, tried to provide an answer. After contacting police departments in seventy- one cities across the country, they got a telling and sobering response. In their report, released that November, the Native American researchers found nearly 60 percent of police departments either did not respond to the request, or returned incomplete or faulty data. The indifference, the incompetence, didn\u2019t end there. Some cities reported being unable to even identify Native victims. Others put down a woman\u2019s race based on memory.\n\nIn several instances, cities couldn\u2019t search for Native American, American Indian, or Alaskan Native victims within their databases because their computer systems simply weren\u2019t built for it. The police department in Fargo, North Dakota, which has a fairly sizable Native American population, was typical. If a victim\u2019s race was not indicated, the city\u2019s record system \u201cdefaults to white,\u201d the researchers were told. Other cities turned in data that confused Native Americans with Indian Americans, with surnames such as \u201cSingh.\u201d In some cases, police departments did not distinguish between missing or murdered victims.\n\nWith such shoddy police reporting, Echo-Hawk and Lucchesi turned elsewhere. They combed media outlets for accounts of missing and murdered women, and spoke with them about their reporting. They spoke with local Indigenous communities. As a result, they uncovered more than 150 missing and murdered women whom police had failed to identify.\n\n$14 at Amazon\n\nThere\u2019s a refrain you hear from Native American advocates about this stark invisibility. As the researchers wrote in their report, Indigenous women who are missing or murdered disappear not just once, but three times: \u201cin life, in the media, in the data.\u201d\n\nMy book, Searching for Savanna, is the story of one woman in one tribe, but her life and her death illuminate this ongoing crisis and the efforts by Native women to resolve it. Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, who was eight months pregnant when she was murdered, and all the missing and murdered Native women like her, deserve to be remembered and counted.\n\nAdapted from the book Searching for Savanna: The Murder of One Native American Woman and the Violence Against the Many by Mona Gable.

Groulx, a lawyer and former Canadian Human Rights Commission adviser, is \u201cleaving to pursue a new opportunity,\u201d NWAC said.\n\nA national apprenticeship program and several smaller programs administered by NWAC ended in March and with that ended the federal funding.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\nGroulx said NWAC has long lobbied for stable core funding to operate, and not just project funding, which comes and goes.\n\nThe organization has found itself in the crosshairs of critics over how it has spent money in recent years, renovating its head office in Gatineau to include high-end event rental spaces, opening luxury \u201cresiliency lodges\u201d in Quebec and New Brunswick, and until this funding cut, planned to start a boutique hotel.\n\n\u201cHow does that serve grassroots women?\u201d said Crystal Semaganis, who worked at NWAC from 2021 to 2023 but left citing a toxic workplace. \u201cHow does that make a difference in our life?\u201d\n\nMORE ON CANADA\nHurricane Beryl forces Canadian airlines to cancel flights.

She noted NWAC is undergoing an audit to discover if all aspects of the funding agreement between the organization and the federal government were met.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have more to say once that\u2019s complete,\u201d Hajdu said.\n\nGroulx pointed to seven years of audits publicly available on the NWAC website.\n\n\u201cOnce that audit is complete, I\u2019m fully convinced NWAC has complied with the rules, and that audit will be on our website as well.\u201d\n\nAside from the controversial foray into luxury businesses, Semaganis is part of a chorus who believe NWAC lost its way as a powerful advocacy group after the Sisters In Spirit project wrapped in 2010. The campaign began in 2004 and is largely credited with putting the issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous women on the national agenda.\n\nBridget Tolley was involved in that project but parted ways with NWAC, often publicly criticizing it for not supporting families of the missing and murdered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy this happened,\u201d Tolley said of the defunding. \u201cBecause we deserve a lot more, a lot better treatment because so many have been hurt by everything that\u2019s happened over there.\u201d\n\nView image in full screen\nBridget Tolley is a Missing and Murdered Women advocate who believes the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada has lost its way. Global News\n\nShe\u2019s referring to nearly a decade of headlines about infighting, leadership coups and allegations of a toxic workplace at NWAC, along with criticism that too many non-Indigenous people were taking up space in the Indigenous organization.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\nView image in full screen\nCrystal Semaganis left the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada is among the many former workers who call it a toxic workplace. Crystal Semaganis\n\n\u201cA lot of dysfunction, a lot of mismanagement, and the administrative follow through of what they were actually trying to do \u2014 just was not there,\u201d Semaganis said.\n\nShe and Tolley hope this isn\u2019t the end for NWAC, but rather a pause ahead of a restructuring.\n\n\u201cThere should be fixing,\u201d Semaganis said. \u201cThere should be meaningful Indigenous engagement.\u201d\n\nAddressing her departure from the organization, Groulx said, \u201cLeaving the role you love is always difficult. It has been an honour and incredible journey leading NWAC and contributing to its success. I am immensely proud of what we have accomplished together and am confident in NWAC\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cIt was a privilege to have served in this role. That said, I am very excited about the prospects of my new role, leading a new enterprise that focuses on social business and Indigenous prosperity.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nJOURNALISTIC STANDARDS\nCOMMENT\nREPORT AN ERROR\n\u00a9 2024 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.\nSponsored content\nMore to Explore\nMORE FROM GLOBAL NEWS\nChilcotin hunting guides say government backtracking on compensation pledge\nChild welfare resolutions barred from upcoming AFN assembly\nADVERTISEMENT\n630 CHED Afternoons with Bryn Griffiths & Reid Wilkins\n2:00 PM - 5:00 PM\n630CHED\nTrending\nGreece is bringing in a 6-day work week.

Despite the increased awareness and an extensive national inquiry, McBride said the situation that Indigenous girls and women face has not substantially changed.\n\n\"I'm a mother. I'm a sister. I'm an aunt,\" she said. \"And I'm just imagining some of our families and our women are suffering right now.\"\n\nThe inquiry's final report was released in 2019 and included sweeping calls for change. It found Indigenous women and girls are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than any other group in Canada.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau accepted the findings of the inquiry, which said the crisis amounted to genocide.\n\nSixty-three per cent of Indigenous women have experienced violence and nearly half have experienced sexual assault, Statistics Canada said in a report last year.\n\nWinnipeg has been called ground zero.\n\nAt least 28 Indigenous women in Manitoba have died due to violence since May 2020, said Sandra DeLaronde, team lead for the Manitoba MMIWG2S+ implementation team. The majority were in Winnipeg.\n\nA group hung 101 red dresses along a chain-link fence outside a landfill in the Manitoba capital over the winter. Winnipeg police have said the bodies of four Indigenous women were disposed of in landfills last year.\n\nThe remains of three of the women have not been found. A man has been charged with first-degree murder in the killings of the four women.\n\nThe remains of another Indigenous woman were also found in a landfill earlier this year.

It also called for funding a new system to alert the public when someone goes missing.\n\n\"The truth is the truth,\" said Leah Gazan, the Winnipeg member of Parliament who presented the motion. \"It's one thing to acknowledge truth. It's another thing to act on it.\"\n\nThe Native Women's Association of Canada has criticized the federal government for not doing more or acting fast enough.

McBride said Tuesday\u2019s motion was an important step, but there is more to do.\n\nMost of the money announced to fulfil the inquiry's 231 calls to justice became stuck in government bureaucracy, DeLaronde said, and it has not made it to the front lines and the Indigenous women and families who need it.\n\nDeLaronde added that all Canadians should use Red Dress Day to reflect on what they can do to create change.\n\n\"Red Dress is a movement that people can get behind, because it's an opportunity to transform the very fabric of this country.\"\n\nBack to Homepage\n\nTypos\nNews Tips\nForums\n8\nShares\n\nMUST-READ STORIES\n\nGet all the day's most vital news with our newsletter, sent every weekday.\n\n\n\nMore Canada News\n\n\n\nCanada\nRECENT STORIES\nAmbushed in failed hit job\nKamloops - 1:46 pm\nHeat warnings issued\nBC Coast - 1:43 pm\nLife in prison for murder\nAbbotsford - 1:39 pm\nA parade of aches and pains\nCalgary - 1:27 pm\nPower restored in Aberdeen\nKamloops - 1:16 pm\nMore Top Stories >\nCanada Quick Links\nCanada Discussion Forum\nGovernment of Canada\nService Canada\nCanada Revenue Agency\nStatistics Canada\nStrategis\nCanada Post\nEnvironment Canada\n\n\n\n\nBody transformation journeys\nGalleries | July 04, 2024\nVanessa Hudgens gives birth\nShowbiz | July 04, 2024\nBaseball playing pup\nMust Watch | July 04, 2024\nMischievous Beagle caught tearing up the toilet paper\nMust Watch | July 04, 2024\nVintage bathrooms\nGalleries | July 04, 2024\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 Castanet.net Make Castanet Your Homepage News Tips Advertising Contact Us"},

OAC officials say the reasoning behind holding an early event was to give attendees time to process the day's meaning ahead of May 5.\n\nSign up now for daily CTV News Ottawa newsletters\nThe information you need to know, sent directly to you: Download the CTV News App\n\n\"I hope that people will walk away with an understanding and awareness of the severity of what First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis women, girls, and children have had to endure,\" said OAC co-chair Stephanie (Mikki) Adams on Friday.\n\nThe Ottawa River Singers bookended the ceremony with a drum circle, while Indigenous leaders read opening prayers.\n\nAs attendees crafted miniature red dresses to put up on poster boards, they were invited to present offerings to ones on display that bear the names of woman and girls who never made it home.\n\nFor event artist Orianna Elijah-Brown, who contributed seven dresses for the day, she says it was a difficult project to undertake.\n\n\"I was pretty down because I was listening to a lot of the stories of the some of the missing and murdered Indigenous women,\" Elijah-Brown recalled. \"I heard stories similar to like myself - some of the girls were sewers and artists and it was really emotional listening to those stories while making the dresses.\"\n\nAt the far side of the venue was a gallery detailing the suffering and achievements of Indigenous peoples.\n\nPhotos detail the chronology, from settlers arriving on Turtle Island in the 15th century, to the systematic oppression of First Nation, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis communities, to the discovery of mass graves resulting from residential schools.\n\n\"It's touching me profoundly, actually, to see it, and I've known about it for a long time, but to actually see images like that is very powerful,\" said resident Liz Wigfull.\n\n\"It really speaks to what people have suffered over such a long time,\" said Wendy Muckle. \"It's hard to imagine how long it's going to take us to make it right.\"\n\nWhile the day highlighted the nation's dark history, it also focused on the healing work that has been accomplished in the community, including the establishing of the Indigenous Women's Safety Table.\n\n\"You've got community leadership happening here in Ottawa, where the local Indigenous community comes together and works collectively towards building Ottawa to be a safer place,\" said Ontario Native Women's Association CEO Cora McGuire-Cyrrette.\u00a0\n\n----------\n\nHope for Wellness Help Line 24/7 1-855-242-3310\n\nNational Residential School Crisis Line: 1-866-925-4419\n\nMental Health Crisis Line (24 hours a day/7 days a week) at 613-722-6914 or if outside Ottawa toll-free at 1-866-996-0991\n\nRELATED IMAGES\n1 / 1\nA photo gallery at a Red Dress Day event at Ottawa City Hall depicts the chronology from settlers arriving on Turtle Island in the 15th century, to the recent discovery of mass graves resulting from residential schools.

It was administered by Northern Development Initiative Trust which selected Rogers Communications for the project following an open-procurement process.\n\nWhen operational, the tower will enable voice, data and text services via high-speed wireless and internet coverage on 4G and LTE networks for Rogers and Fido customers. Customers using other providers will be able to dial 911 in the community and along the highway.\n\nIt will also bring service to the Witset First Nation, the only band along the corridor without cell coverage. Formerly known as the Moricetown Band, it is located 34 kilometres north of Smithers and along the Bulkley River Valley.

These are our friends and our family members,\u201d she said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe process of hanging red dresses is to evoke emotion and address a lived reality for many Indigenous communities,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was designed to serve as a reminder of how deep this affects our communities.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMany Indigenous people know more than one woman or child who has lost their life or has mysteriously vanished.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe REDress event kicked off on Monday. The theme of Monday\u2019s event was Families of MMIWG. Local Indigenous activist and community member Linda John shared her family\u2019s experiences.\n\u00a0\nThe event will culminate on Friday with the screening of \u201cOur Sisters in Spirit.\u201d It is a paid event with all proceeds going to Abbey House; a St. Catharines-based Indigenous women\u2019s transitional home.\n\u00a0\nThis year, due to novel coronavirus, the university elected to transition to an online format. The REDress Project will bring together speakers from across the country to highlight some of the issues affecting Indigenous women.\n\u00a0\nFour of five panel discussions will be broadcast on Niagara College and Brock social media platforms. The exception being Wednesday\u2019s event, Brock\u2019s Decolonial Reading Circle hosts Helen Knott. All interested participants will have to register.\n\u00a0\nBrock\u2019s acting vice-provost, Indigenous engagement, Robyn Bourgeois said continuing to raise awareness of the longstanding injustices Indigenous women face is of critical importance.\n\u00a0\n\u201cViolence against Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGTBQQIA people has always been a part of colonialism in Canada, and it continues to be a part of Canadian society because Canada remains a colonial country,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhile Canada undertook a formal inquiry into this violence, the government has yet to respond to its findings and, more importantly, take action to protect Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGTBQQIA people from violence. This inaction comes with a tremendous cost for Indigenous Peoples.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFor information on the event, visit Brock\u2019s website: https://bit.ly/3aTNvAq.\n\u00a0\nSean Vanderklis is a Niagara-based reporter for the Niagara Falls Review.

Displays are being planned for 2023. photo Theresa McManus\nListen to this article\n00:03:28\n\nA display of red dresses around the community is one of the ways New Westminster is commemorating Red Dress Day.\n\nMay 5 is Red Dress Day, a day that honours the memory and lives of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people across Canada and the United States. As part of this year\u2019s campaign, the City of New Westminster will be creating a display of red dresses in the community.\n\nAnyone wishing to donate an adult-sized red dress (no logos) can drop them off until Thursday, April 27 at the front desk of Anvil Centre, Centennial Community Centre, Century House, New Westminster City Hall, the #1 fire hall at Sixth and McBride, the police station, the main branch of the New Westminster Public Library, Queensborough Community Centre and Queen\u2019s Park Arena.\n\nNew Westminster City Hall will also be lit up in red in hour of Red Dress Day on May 5.\n\nMayor Patrick Johnstone has proclaimed May 5 as Red Dress Day in New Westminster.\n\n\u201cM\u00e9tis artist Jaime Black helped inspire the red dress movement where red dresses are hung from windows and trees as a representation of the pain and loss felt by loved ones and survivors,\u201d said the proclamation. \u201cIndigenous women and girls are five times more likely to experience violence than any other population in Canada. This is a national crisis that requires urgent, informed and collaborative action.\u201d\n\nThe proclamation said the Red Dress Campaign is being organized jointly by the Spirit of the Children Society and the City of New Westminster. It stated that non-Indigenous people have a role to play in the fight for justice for missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and gender diverse people in this country.\n\nCoun. Nadine Nakagawa said some people may think the issue has gone away since the federal government did a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\n\u201cIt very clearly hasn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nonstop news reports across Canada, including our larger Metro Vancouver community, about Indigenous women and girls and two-spirit folks going missing and being murdered.\u201d\n\nLaunched in September 2016, the national inquiry published its final report in June 2019.\n\n\u201cThere are actions for all levels of government, including us, to take from that report,\u201d Nakagawa said. \u201cThat report was created with literally, quite literally, blood and tears. And I just really want to emphasize that.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, New Westminster city council approved a series of actions in response to Reclaiming Power and Place: The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. The report contains 231 calls to justice.\n\n\u201cThis is an important day for the community to reflect on the rights of Indigenous women and girls whose lives are just at so much more risk than myself as a non-Indigenous person,\u201d Nakagawa said. \u201cSo, again, if you haven\u2019t read the murdered and missing Indigenous women report from 2019, it\u2019s still there, it\u2019s still available; the calls are still relevant, and I encourage us all to take a look at the calls for justice and commit to moving them forward.\u201d\n\nThe proclamation noted the City of New Westminster has declared A Year of Truth, and encourages New West residents to join the city on its reconciliation journey.\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nLetter to the editor\nReport a mistake\nReader Feedback 1\n\tShow\nThis has been shared 2 times\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nRelated\n\tNew West: A B.C. leader in acting on TRC Calls to Action\n\tUnmarked Qayqayt graves get markers more than 100 years after burials\n\tIndigenous relations advisor to help New West with its reconciliation efforts\n\tQayqayt First Nation Chief: \u201cPeople across Canada have listened\u201d\n\nCOMMUNITY POLL\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nDo you think New West city council should sign a carbon emission declaration and pledge form?\nview related story\n No, it's an invasion of privacy.\n No, the climate change focus should be on policy, not on personal choices.\n No, it's unfair to those who may have mobility or other challenges.\n No, for another reason not listed here.\n Yes, councillors should lead by example.\n Yes, personal responsibility and policy change can co-exist in the fight against climate change.\n Yes, it would make a symbolic statement.\n Yes, for another reason not listed here.\n Don't know/don't care.\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nTRENDING TODAY\n1\t\nUptown Live 2024: Bye-bye beer gardens, hello site-wide licensing\n\n2\t\nCommunity mourns popular New West DJ, Starbucks barista Holly Kang\n\n3\t\nStudy claims New West is one of the most health conscious cities in Canada\n\n4\t\nWhat's happening?

Come together, wear red and show your support in honour of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2-Spirit+ people.\u201d\n\nThe City of New Westminster has proclaimed May 5 as Red Dress Day in the city.\n\nCoun. Nadine Nakagawa said the day is important as it commemorates missing and murdered Indigenous women. She invites all community members to attend the event.\n\nThe National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls released its 1,200-page report, Reclaiming Power and Place, in June 2019. It included 231 actions, or \u201ccalls for justice,\u201d for governments and Canadians.\n\n\u201cThere are calls for justice in that report \u2013 they are not calls for action, they are calls for justice, targeted at all levels of government,\u201d Nakagawa said. \u201cI want to remind us that that report was written with the blood and tears, literally, of Indigenous women and girls.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to remember the violence that\u2019s taken place against Indigenous women and girls, Nakagawa said it\u2019s critical that those calls for justice be met \u2013 something that has yet to happen.\n\nAt its April 22 meeting, Coun. Daniel Fontaine thanked Nakagawa for pulling the Red Dress Day proclamation from council\u2019s consent agenda. (Items are only discussed if they\u2019re \u201cpulled\u201d from the consent agenda for discussion by a member of council).\n\n\u201cI want to also recognize \u2013 as a M\u00e9tis person myself, the only indigenous person on council \u2013 that it was M\u00e9tis artist Jaime Black that helped inspire the Red Dess movement itself,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that's something that is both a subject of pride and of great sadness in terms of the impact of so many Indigenous women across, not only British Columbia but across Canada.\u201d\n\nThe City of New Westminster\u2019s Red Dress Day proclamation states that non-Indigenous people have a role to play in the fight for justice for missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse people in Canada. The city and the Spirit of the Children Society are organizing a Red Dress campaign in New West from May 1 to 31.\n\n\u201cIndigenous women and girls are five times more likely to experience violence than any other population in Canada,\u201d said the proclamation. \u201cThis is a national crisis that requires urgent, informed and collaborative action.\u201d\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nLetter to the editor\nReport a mistake\nThis has been shared 1 time\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nRelated\n\tNew Westminster and District Labour Council appeals for safe work now\n\tLike a Taylor Swift concert, the New West tree sale is a hot ticket in town\n\tNew West council rejects proposal to add dentist office in Sapperton\n\nCOMMUNITY POLL\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nDo you think New West city council should sign a carbon emission declaration and pledge form?\nview related story\n No, it's an invasion of privacy.\n No, the climate change focus should be on policy, not on personal choices.\n No, it's unfair to those who may have mobility or other challenges.\n No, for another reason not listed here.\n Yes, councillors should lead by example.\n Yes, personal responsibility and policy change can co-exist in the fight against climate change.\n Yes, it would make a symbolic statement.\n Yes, for another reason not listed here.\n Don't know/don't care.\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nTRENDING TODAY\n1\t\nUptown Live 2024: Bye-bye beer gardens, hello site-wide licensing\n\n2\t\nCommunity mourns popular New West DJ, Starbucks barista Holly Kang\n\n3\t\nStudy claims New West is one of the most health conscious cities in Canada\n\n4\t\nWhat's happening?

Now in 2022, the day is commemorated in both Canada and the United States with ceremonies honouring these individuals, wearing red as a show of solidarity, and hanging a red dress in front of homes and establishments.\n\nWe are all emotionally connected in this effort, whether we are angered, fearful, hopeful, embarrassed, outraged, curious, impartial or directly involved as a victim, a victim's family member or a victimizer.\n\nOutraged by the discovery of multiple infant gravesites throughout North America, we can further center our attention, determination and energy towards further discoveries of Indigenous oppression. Decades have passed, as many indigenous women, children and family members have disappeared or been found murdered, while the attention of our police forces and public authorities have centered upon these events only to not fully close these multiple criminal cases, which remain cold and forgotten.\n\nNational investigations have been carried out by The Harper-Trudeau administrations in Canada, while the public energy in America has been hindered by inter-State conflict and jurisdiction. Canada's RCMP has continued to investigate these cases, solving a mere 11 percent of these cases. Yes, many of these cases are historic and difficult to solve, but public determination maybe able to pressure our governments to create distinct, uniquely Indigenous centered forces that will investigate each case to a successful completion.\n\nThis movement does not need to be just Indigenous Centered. 50 percent of our population are Women. Women are victimized 45 percent more than their male counterparts. This can be about the private, public and national victimization of what many societies view as the\u201cWeaker Sex\u201d, Womanhood. In the past, women were seen as the focal point of Indigenous culture.\n\nThe governments of the time centered their destructive efforts upon attacks directed towards the family, children and Women. Society's efforts to maintain full employment. Society took women out of the workforce placing them at home. Women have been the scapegoat of many societal ills as well. Feminism became a target to many and not a logical ally.

Marius Auer/Herald\n\nThe Nicola Valley Institute of Technology (NVIT) is focused on supporting the wellness of students and community members alike, as many continue to be affected by the ongoing Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) crisis.\n\n\u201cNVIT has a number of items within our campus where we\u2019re bringing awareness to MMIWG2S+ issues,\u201d said Sue Sterling-Bur, vice president for students at NVIT\u2019s Merritt campus.\n\n\u201cOur students come from across Canada. 80 percent of our student population is Indigenous, so that tells us that every single student in the building is connected to someone that has a family member or knows someone that is missing or murdered. It really does impact our entire student population, as it does our staff as well.\u201d\n\nThe school\u2019s most recent initiative is their new memorial garden, honouring all those impacted by MMIWG issues. According to the Assembly of First Nations, Indigenous women make up 16 percent of all female homicide victims and 11 percent of missing women, despite only making up 4.3 percent of the population.\n\nWith so many in the community feeling the weight of these issues, NVIT created the garden as a space of reflection.\n\n\u201cWe created and built the MMIWG2S+ Memorial Garden here. It\u2019s located in the central area of NVIT. It was to represent a coming of home for people who are within that missing and murdered category. We wanted a safe place for people who have family members in that category to go reflect, sit, listen, and remember their people.\u201d\n\nStudents from NVIT\u2019s carpentry class built the bright red structure at the centre of the memorial garden, representing the colour attributed to the MMIWG movement. The structure was built to represent a s7\u00edstken, which is a traditional pithouse for the local Nlaka\u2019pamux nations.\n\nIn addition to the s7\u00edstken and benches already there, the school hopes to add solar-powered lighting and a water feature in collaboration with Conayt Friendship Society, who has supplied funding to the project.\n\n\u201cWater for Nlaka\u2019pamux and Sylix territory representing healing. To add a water feature will add that other aspect of water and healing for families.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a space where we can host events. If a community is doing a walk they are more than welcome to come and end their walks here. Or they\u2019re welcome to connect with our campus and book the site.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the memorial garden, the school also recently commissioned a local carpenter to build a cabinet which now moves throughout the campus, housing a red dress adorned with paddles and the NVIT logo. This dressed is used to represent the presence of those missing and murdered during school ceremonies and events.\n\n\u201cOur Indigenization Committee and Elders Committee wanted to have a red dress inside the building to represent the missing and murdered ingidenous girls and women.\u201d\n\nStudents at NVIT regularly receive communications regarding the institution\u2019s sexual violence policy, highlighting the importance of adressing topics such as consent and sexual assault. The school also offers a plethora of mental health support for students who require it, maintaining a contract with Nicola Family Therapy. Sterling-Bur says educating the community and creating awareness are key.\n\n\u201cThis is happening. Not only for Indigenous women and girls and two-spirited, but for young men and men within our territory. It\u2019s quite prominent and very scary.\u201d\n\nConnecting with those who may be more vulnerable, such as individuals struggling with addiction and mental health issues, may help to reduce their risk of becoming a victim of the MMIWG crisis, says Sterling-Bur, adding that these groups aren\u2019t exclusively targeted but have higher risk factors.\n\nThose interested in more information about NVIT\u2019s new memorial garden and other initiatives should call 250-378-3300, or visit their website at www.nvit.ca.\n\nSHARE:\n\n \nPREVIOUS\nNicola Mining to assist in Lower Nicola infrastructure repairs\nNEXT\nDana Cooke places 5th in Kentucky 3 Day Event\nNEWSLETTER\n\nFirst Name \n\nLast Name \n\nEmail address: \n\nCLASSIFIEDS\nMedical Office Assistant Position June 19, 2024\nSales Person/Office Admin May 15, 2024\nNVCL April 4, 2024\nRECENT OBITUARIES\nAlan Norman Clarence Taylor June 19, 2024\nFay Sturney June 19, 2024\nBeverly Jean Malchuk June 19, 2024\nSister Newspapers\nBowen Island Undercurrent\nBurnaby Now\nBusiness in Vancouver\nCastanet\nCoast Reporter\nDelta Optimist\nLethbridge Herald\nMedicine Hat News\nMoose Jaw Today\nNew West Record\nNorth Shore News\nPique Newsmagazine\nPowell River Peak\nPrince George Citizen\nREW.ca\nRichmond News\nSaskToday.ca\nSquamish Chief\nThe Orca\nTimes Colonist\nTriCity News\nVancouver is Awesome\nWestern Investor\nAirdrie Today\nAlberta Prime Times\nCochrane Today\nLakeland Today\nMountain View Today\nOkotoks Today\nRocky Mountain Outlook\nSt. Albert Gazette\nTown and Country Today\nOther Sections\nAbout Us\n\nAdvertise\n\nReal Estate\n\nClassifieds\n\nEvents\n\nMagazines\n\nSubscribe\n\nContact Us\n\nConnect\n\nMerritt Herald\n#201- 1951 Garcia Street,\nMerritt, BC V1K 1B8\n\nPhone\n1-250-378-4241\n\nAberdeen Publishing \u00a9 Copyright \u00ae\u00a02020.\u00a0\u00a0All rights reserved.

Durling\nMar 11, 2020 4:26 PM\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nStock photo\n\nNIPAWIN \u2014 It was an noticeable \u2013 and unwanted \u2013 addition to a red dress display memorializing missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nA single white dress with a sign saying \u201cwhite people die too\u201d was placed amongst the red dresses in the overnight hours.\n\nBrandie Trew, a member of the Nipawin Reconciliation committee, said she hung the dresses at Cumberland College in Nipawin on March 6, to raise awareness of the missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nOn March 10, Trew came into work and saw there was a white dress hanging with the others.\n\nWhen she approached the dress, she noticed there was a large sign which read \u201cwhite people die too.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason I feel it\u2019s disrespectful is that white people are put first in the justice system, they\u2019re put first in the police system,\u201d Trew said. \u201cIt is a Canadian and international epidemic that Indigenous women and girls are lost in the system even when they\u2019re missing.\u201d\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, nine per cent of female homicide victims in 1980 were Indigenous. By 2015, Indigenous women made up 24 per cent of homicide victims in Canada. This was noted in the federal government\u2019s 2018 interim report for the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls.\n\nThe 2018 interim report shows that while homicide rates for non-Indigenous women have gone down over the decades, homicide rates for Indigenous women have been going up. Indigenous women are 12 times more likely to be murdered or missing than any other women in Canada, and 16 times more likely than Caucasian women.\n\nIn Manitoba or Saskatchewan, they are 19 more times likely than Caucasian women to be murdered or missing.\n\n\u201cAs a white settler, I know that if my child were to go missing, the police action would be immediate. But I don\u2019t feel my Indigenous friends receive the same respect,\u201d Trew said.\n\n\u201cBy them doing that they\u2019re saying and they\u2019re reinforcing that missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls don\u2019t need the attention that they\u2019re getting.\u201d\n\nShe said the disruption to the display made her feel \u201chorrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have lots of work and private relationships with First Nations people and I know many women who have gone missing or have been murdered. So when I hang the dresses, I think of them.\u201d\n\nSee a typo/mistake?\nHave a story/tip?\nGet your daily Saskatchewan news briefing\nEmail\nSign Up\nThis has not been shared.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick\n\nThe head of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada says it\u2019s clear there's an ongoing emergency nearly four years after the final report into missing and murdered Indigenous woman and girls was released.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe are in a crisis,\u201d said Carol McBride.\u00a0\n\nRed dresses are set to be on display across the country Friday to recognize the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People. It has become known as Red Dress Day and the empty garments serve as a symbol of lives that have been lost.\n\nEach year there are more events, rallies and art displays. Despite the increased awareness and an extensive national inquiry, McBride said the situation that Indigenous girls and women face has not substantially changed.\n\n\u201cI'm a mother. I'm a sister. I'm an aunt,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I'm just imagining some of our families and our women are suffering right now.\u201d\n\nThe inquiry\u2019s final report was released in 2019 and included sweeping calls for change. It found Indigenous women and girls are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than any other group in Canada.\u00a0\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau accepted the findings of the inquiry, which said the crisis amounted to genocide.\n\nSixty-three per cent of Indigenous women have experienced violence and nearly half have experienced sexual assault, Statistics Canada said in a report last year.\u00a0\n\nWinnipeg has been called ground zero.\n\nAt least 28 Indigenous women in Manitoba have died due to violence since May 2020, said Sandra DeLaronde, team lead for the Manitoba MMIWG2S+ implementation team. The majority were in Winnipeg.\u00a0\n\nA group hung 101 red dresses along a chain-link fence outside a landfill in the Manitoba capital over the winter. Winnipeg police have said the bodies of four Indigenous women were disposed of in landfills last year.\u00a0\n\nThe remains of three of the women have not been found. A man has been charged with first-degree murder in the killings of the four women.\n\nThe remains of another Indigenous woman were also found in a landfill earlier this year. Police said her death is not a homicide.\u00a0\n\n\"When I think (about it), I cry,\" DeLaronde said. \"I have to focus on the thousands of women and girls that are still here and how we can keep them safe.\"\n\nDeLaronde said it's important to recognize that Indigenous people are sacred, and they should not only be honoured when they are gone.\n\nThe House of Commons unanimously backed a motion Tuesday declaring the deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls a Canada-wide emergency. It also called for funding a new system to alert the public when someone goes missing.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe truth is the truth,\u201d said Leah Gazan, the Winnipeg member of Parliament who presented the motion. \u201cIt's one thing to acknowledge truth. It's another thing to act on it.\u201d\n\nThe Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada has criticized the federal government for not doing more or acting fast enough. McBride said Tuesday\u2019s motion was an important step, but there is more to do.\n\nMost of the money announced to fulfil the inquiry's 231 calls to justice became stuck in government bureaucracy, DeLaronde said, and it has not made it to the front lines and the Indigenous women and families who need it.\n\nDeLaronde added that all Canadians should use Red Dress Day to reflect on what they can do to create change.\u00a0\n\n\"Red Dress is a movement that people can get behind, because it's an opportunity to transform the very fabric of this country.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 5, 2023.\u00a0\n\nKelly Geraldine Malone, The Canadian Press\n\nHave a story idea?\nLetter to the editor\nReport a mistake\nThis has not been shared.

[Onion Lake Cree Nation, Facebook.]\n- Advertisement -\n\nPeople in both Lloydminster and The Onion Lake Cree Nation joined the rest of Canada in honouring Red Dress Day.\n\nThe day, May 5th, marks the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, a day that commemorates the victims of and highlights the ongoing violence against Indigenous women, girls and two-sprit peoples.\n\nAccording to data from Statistics Canada, Indigenous women are almost six times more likely to be victims of homicide than non-Indigenous women and are at higher risk of having violence of any kind perpetrated against them.\n\nSupporters gathered in Onion Lake on May 5th to commemorate all people from their community who have been victims of this violence. People gave speeches, held vigil, gave prayers and sang traditional songs to honour their friends, loved ones and family members impacted.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOnion Lake Chief Henry Lewis says for many people in his community, this day is about rebuilding lives as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy thing when you lose somebody, even under normal circumstances, but in these cases, it takes a lot of time for people to heal. This is all about our healing when we do this, honouring our missing women. It also helps the people who were affected, who lost their loved ones.\u201d\n\nHere in Lloydminster, a gathering was held as well to acknowledge, support the families of and pay respects to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Peoples.\n\nPut on by Lloydminster & Vermilion For Equality, the event started with a traditional pipe ceremony at City Hall, followed by speeches and stories, traditional prayers and songs and then a solidarity march around the area.\n\nWhile they did have to take precautions due to COVID-19, Tigra-Lee Campbell with LVFE says there was good attendance and important conversations held.\u00a0 She says this was an important step in our community for honouring these victims and fostering an ongoing conversation about awareness.\n\n\u201cThis should not be just on one day a year. The awareness of Missing and Murdered Indigenous peoples needs to happen all year, 365 days a year.\u201d\n\nThe RedDress project originally began life as an art installation in Manitoba in 2011, but quickly became a way for people across Canada to raise awareness.\n\nVideo from the rally in Lloydminster [LVFE, Facebook]\n- Advertisement -\nFacebookTwitterReddItWhatsAppEmail\n- Advertisment -\n- Advertisment -\n- Advertisement -\nContinue Reading\nNews\nDesign of passing lanes for Highway 17 North planned for 2025\nNews\nLashburn gets $83K SGI grant for pathway for recreation facility\nNews\nCity property inspections north of 44 Street this summer\nNews\nMen\u2019s Shelter head to run across Alberta, Saskatchewan in August fundraiser\nLoad more\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\nIN THE NEWS\n\nDesign of passing lanes for Highway 17 North planned for 2025\n \nLashburn gets $83K SGI grant for pathway for recreation facility\n \nCity property inspections north of 44 Street this summer\n \nMen\u2019s Shelter head to run across Alberta, Saskatchewan in August fundraiser\n \nAlberta, Saskatchewan premiers to discuss energy at Lloydminster Heavy Oil Show in September\nLocal trio score Synergy Shares Scholarships\n \nAlberta and Saskatchewan discuss healthcare in Lloydminster\n \nOccupied RV hijacked and crashed at Weaver Park Campground\n \nAlberta health minister meets Saskatchewan health minister in Lloydminster\n \nLloydminster hosts U11 Girls Advanced Provincials\nLloydminster golfers take their shot at RBC PGA Scramble, Jul. 13\n \nLoon Lake RCMP seek suspect\n \nOn average seven people die in July due to impaired driving: SGI\n \nLakeland College Rustlers teams hosting conference finals in 2025\n \nPolice seek Jordan Keenan-Quewezance, advise do not approach\nThe GOAT\u2019s Christmas Wish\n \nEXCLUSIVE: Lloyd Homeless Issued $580 Fines, Evictions\n \nCanadian Indigenous Music\n \nDONATE TO THE GOAT\u2019S CHRISTMAS WISH \u2013 OCTOBER 19\n \nGoat Christmas Wish Radiothon\nNews\nWin\nEvents\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nWe\u2019re Hiring"},

In-person learning and indoor dining was shut down. Social gathering limits and capacity at public events was limited to five people.\u00a0\n\nEmployers were tasked with ensuring their employees worked remotely where possible. Weddings, funerals, religious services, rites and ceremonies were permitted at 50 per cent capacity, along with shopping malls and public libraries. Indoor concert venues, theatres, cinemas, museums, galleries, historic sites and tour guide services were also shut down.\u00a0\n\nThe Upper Grand District School Board announced plans for a shift to remote learning from Jan. 5 to 17.\u00a0\nThe first baby of 2022 is born at Headwaters Health Care Centre at 1:11 a.m. on Jan. 1, weighing 7 pounds, 15 ounces. In 2020 there were almost 900 deliveries at Headwaters.\n\nJan. 13\n\nFive acres of land associated with the Orangeville Railway Development Corporation was sold to the City of Brampton for $24.24 million. In 2020, Orangeville Council, as the lone shareholder of ORDC, directed the board to sell or lease rail line assets.\nA local company aimed at reducing plastic waste, EcoTank, launched its first windshield wiper fluid refill station at the local 7-Eleven. The refill station eliminates the need for plastic jugs that hold windshield washing fluid, in turn helping the environment.\nHeadwaters pauses non-emergent surgeries/procedures, non-urgent diagnostic imaging and ambulatory clinical activity in response to the province\u2019s directives to combat a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases due to Omicron. The pause in non-emergent surgeries was intended to preserve hospital bed capacity and health human resources.\nFamily Transition Place received $22,500 and Kerry\u2019s Place received $116,700 from the provincial government for upgrades and repairs.\n\nJan. 20\n\nUpper Grand District School Board (UGDSB) students have returned to the classroom for the first time since winter break and despite high cases of the Omicron COVID-19 variant, the region\u2019s top doctor has said the benefits of reopening schools outweigh the short-term risk.\n\nNicola Mercer released a statement last Friday (Jan. 14) ahead of the scheduled return to in-person learning on Jan. 17, noting the importance of in-person learning on children, their families, and the community as a whole.\n\nMichelle Hanson, the 38-year-old Amaranth mother who plead guilty to criminal negligence causing death in the 2018 drowning of her three-year-old Kaden Young, received a two-year conditional sentence.\n\nHanson appear in an Orangeville courtroom via video conference on Jan. 18 for her sentencing hearing. The courtroom heard that Hanson will serve the first 18 months of her two-year conditional sentence under house arrest. A three-year driving probation is also to take effect following the completion of the conditional sentence. Hanson will be required to attend grief and substance abuse counselling over the two years of the house arrest and during her one year of probation.\n\nShortly before 1 a.m. on Feb. 21, 2018, Hanson\u2019s vehicle was pulled into the Grand River during a period of heavy flooding which saw river water rise up onto the road. Hanson had taken her three-year-old son Kaden, who was having trouble sleeping, for a drive into Grand Valley where she planned to attend a convenience store.\n\nWithin minutes of leaving her home, Hanson drove her vehicle around a road-closed barrier on the 10th Line of Amaranth onto a flooded section of the road, resulting in the vehicle being swept into the river. Hanson was able to escape the vehicle with Kaden, but lost grip of him as they were pushed down the river by the strong current. She was pulled from the river by EMS.\n\nAn agreed statement of facts said paramedics attending to Hanson detected an odour of alcohol and blood samples obtained at the hospital showed a blood alcohol concentration of 60 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. Oxycodone was also detected but was noted to be a concentration associated with a \u2018therapeutic range\u2019\n\nIn the weeks following, hundreds of volunteers from the community searched the banks of the Grand River for Kaden\u2019s body. On April, 2021, two months to the day of the incident, Kaden\u2019s body was recovered in Belwood Lake.\n\n\u00a0Hanson was charged in October of 2018, and ordered to stand trial on counts of impaired driving causing death and criminal negligence causing death following a preliminary inquiry in 2019.\n\nHanson plead guilty to criminal negligence causing death in November of 2021, and the charge of impaired driving causing death was dropped as part of the plea deal.\n\nIsland Lake Family Park in Mono was hit with graffiti, leaving much of the playground equipment and some park benches tagged with spray paint. On. Jan. 11 Dufferin OPP received a report of mischief from a concerned citizen regarding graffiti at the park, at which time an officer arrived at the scene and an investigation commenced.\n\nJan. 27\n\nA convoy of big rigs and motor vehicles will be rolling through Orangeville tomorrow (Jan. 28) in support of a nationwide protest against vaccine mandates for truckers and all Canadians.\n\nThe convoy, which organizers estimate will be roughly 50 vehicles long, with more than a dozen semis, will roll through town at 11 a.m., coming down Highway 10 before turning onto Highway 9 towards Highway 400 South and then onto Highway 401 East to Ottawa, with Parliament Hill as the final destination for Saturday (Jan. 29).\n\nThere they will be joined by tens of thousands of truckers and supporters that left from Vancouver on Jan. 23 and Nova Scotia today (Jan. 27), in addition to countless informal convoys across the country for a massive protest. The convoys that began in Vancouver and Nova Scotia grow larger with each city they pass through, as supporters and fellow truckers across Canada join in.\n\nThe County of Dufferin proposes a 0.96 per cent budget increase for 2022.\nOrangeville council considers crisis care beds and a warming centre for the winter season at a Jan. 24 council meeting. The Orangeville Fire Hall on Dawson Rd. is being considered for the location of crisis beds as it will be vacant when the town\u2019s new fire hall opens in the spring of 2024.\nThe 2nd Annual Food Bank Street Challenge (FBSC) officially wrapped up last weekend and the numbers are in. Nearly 7,500 lbs of non-perishable food was collected and donated since the challenge kicked off in early October, with about half being kept in Orangeville.\n\nMono resident Jaylen Padayachee, 13, with the help of his dad Koven, created the challenge in November of 2020 when he realized the local food bank wasn\u2019t receiving as many donations as normal due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While this year\u2019s challenge didn\u2019t raise as many donations as last year, which topped 30,000 lbs, organizers are still happy that the 7,500 lbs of food will go out to those who need it most.\n\nMono Council\u2019s 2022 Draft Budget is currently at a 2.4 per cent tax levy increase, much lower than the originally proposed 10.9 per cent increase from staff, during a meeting on Tuesday (Jan. 25).\n\nCouncil members struggled to keep the tax levy increase to 2.4 per cent, they examined the budget document line by line seeking to reduce it by some $700,000 to reach the 2.4 per cent target. It was an arduous meeting, which saw Council reduce a number of capital reserves in their efforts to keep the tax levy increase low.\n\nThe Ontario government has announced the gradual easing of COVID-19 public health measures with the first step in a three-step plan. Starting Jan. 31, social gathering limits will increase to up to 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors. A number of indoor businesses and setting will be permitted to reopen with a capacity limit of 50 per cent, including restaurants, bars, retailers, shopping malls, grocery stores, pharmacies, gyms, cinemas, museums, galleries, casinos, and religious services. Ontario will enter the final step of its reopening plan on March 14 with a lifting of capacity limits in all indoor public settings.\nA 44-year-old Orangeville man wanted on an arrest warrant in connection to the murder of a women in Shelburne has been found dead. Dufferin OPP announced on Jan. 20 that the body of Scott Pinney had been discovered inside his abandoned vehicle in a secluded area near Hearst, Ont. on Jan. 17 by a passerby. The death has not been deemed suspicious or a suicide, according to police.\n\nFeb. 3\n\nHundreds of Orangeville residents lined Highway 10 despite the -34\u00b0C wind chill last Friday (Jan. 28), holding up signs of support as a convoy of over 100 vehicles, led by big rigs, rolled through town on its way to Ottawa.\n\nIn the morning, every few vehicles that passed by honked their horns in support of the protestors, until the convoy arrived around noon, a little behind schedule. Despite the holdup, hundreds of the convoy supporters didn\u2019t budge and braved the cold for well over an hour, with a common goal of ending vaccine mandates and other COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nProtestors said they want people who lost their jobs over COVID vaccine mandates to be reinstated, noting people who are vaccinated can spread the virus just as easily. Protestors also said they were opposed to their kids being unable to play sports and the shutting down of schools.\n\nThe trucks in the local convoy started in Owen Sound and joined a larger convoy of vehicles in Belleville before heading to Parliament Hill. There they joined thousands of truckers and people through the weekend, protesting vaccine mandates.\n\nDufferin OPP say they did not encounter any issues with the people participating in the convoy or anyone that assembled to view the convoy. No roads were closed but police did momentarily block traffic in Shelburne and Orangeville to facilitate the safe movement of the general public and the convoy through Dufferin County.\n\nDufferin\u2013Caledon MP Kyle Seeback expressed his support for the Freedom Convoy and penned a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, asking that he reverse the federal government\u2019s decision to require cross-border truckers to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The policy came into effect Jan. 15, and is expected to ground 26,000 of the 160,00 trucker drivers who make regular cross-border trips.\n\nSeeback told the Citizen the policy won\u2019t make a difference with the Omicron variant, as it has already travelled widely across the world, and forcing more truckers to get vaccinated won\u2019t stop the spread.\n\nThe fire department will lose about 20 per cent of its volunteer members on Feb. 11 for failing to comply with the Town\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination policy.

During a special ceremony at Town Hall on Monday (May 30), Orangeville\u2019s Joint Accessibility Advisory Committee chair Coun. Lisa Post and Mayor Sandy Brown handed out the 2022 Accessibility Champion Awards. The recipients this year are participants of Branching Out Support Services (BOSS), executive director of BOSS Kimberly Van Ryn, and Active Lives Canada.\nPeel Regional Council has endorsed a report outlining the intent to finalize the acquisition of approximately 51 km of the former Orangeville-Brampton Railway corridor from the Orangeville Railway Development Corporation, for the purposes of a recreational trail and future utility corridor to help meet the needs of a growing Region.\nThe Brackett Auto Group, Orangeville\u2019s leader in auto sales, is pleased to announce it is welcoming Orangeville Volkswagen to its line-up of dealerships in the region.\n\nThe Group already has MacMaster Buick GMC and Orangeville Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram under the local automotive dealership banner. The Brackett Auto Group also operates Bray Chevrolet Buick GMC in Sundridge, and Edmonds Chevrolet Buick GMC in Huntsville. In addition, Fix Auto body shop in Orangeville is part of the group and is an expert in car body and collision repair for all types of vehicles.\n\nThe Lord Dufferin IODE\u2019s 27th Annual Geranium Sale was a big success this year, raising approximately $8,000 for the local non-profit club, with over 4,300 geraniums sold.\nOrangeville Council voted 5-2 on Monday (May 30) to reverse a decision made at their last meeting (May 16) that rejected Cachet Development\u2019s proposal for apartment buildings by Veterans Way. Coun. Joe Andrews, who previously voted against final approvals for Cachet Developments, brought forward the motion to approve it that passed 5-2.\n\nDuring the May 30 meeting, Coun. Andrews explained that he wasn\u2019t comfortable with the development moving forward until there was assurances that the missing link of road along Hansen Blvd. would be completed before Cachet\u2019s apartment buildings are occupied. Once constructed, Cachet\u2019s development will house 383 apartment dwelling units. Coun. Andrews said he now supports the development since Cachet has communicated to the Town that their development won\u2019t be occupied until a couple of years after Hansen Blvd\u2019s missing link is built\n\nAffectionately nicknamed \u201cDuck Day,\u201d the Grand Valley Lions hosted their duck race on May 28 at Hereward Park, welcoming hundreds of visitors to Grand Valley. Almost $20,000 in prizes was doled out to participants.\nOrangeville councillor Lisa Post is looking to move up the ladder of municipal politics. She recently filed her nomination papers for the mayor position at Town Hall. She told the Citizen she wants to build a collective vision with the community that can be shared over the next four-year term of Council.\n\nJune 9\n\nConservative politician, Sylvia Jones is now serving her fifth consecutive term as MPP in Dufferin\u2013Caledon. She holds one of 83 seats claimed by Doug Ford\u2019s Progressive Conservative last Thursday (June 2), giving the party well over the 63 seats needed to form a majority government. Jones was re-elected with 49.7 per cent of the vote.\nDowntown Orangeville was the busiest it\u2019s been in more than two years from June 3 to 5 with the long-awaited return of the Blues and Jazz Festival. While the final numbers are still being tallied, president of the festival, Josh Leitch said it\u2019s their biggest one yet, based on observations, photos, and social media posts from the three-day event.\nThe Town of Orangeville\u2019s Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), Ed Brennan, has gone on medical leave and the Town\u2019s General Manager of Community Services, Ray Osmond, is now the interim CAO.\n\nJune 16\n\nFrom steel pan drumming to dancing, food and artwork the Dufferin County Multicultural Day Event made a return with a bang this past weekend. The Dufferin County Multicultural Foundation and the Museum of Dufferin (MoD) hosted the Fifth Annual Dufferin County Multicultural Day Event on June 11, celebrating the diversity within the community.\nThe numbers are in and this year\u2019s Orangeville Blues and Jazz Festival was the biggest yet. The three-day event, which ran June 3-5, saw over 40,000 attendees, representing a 10 per cent increase in attendance over 2019 when the festival was held last.\nDufferin\u2013Caledon MP Kyle Seeback has changed the candidate he\u2019s supporting in the Conservative Leadership Race. Seeback had initially backed Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown, who joined the Conservative Party in 2006 as a Member of Parliament, as the next leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, but announced last week his support has changed to Pierre Poilievre.\nFood banks and programs in Dufferin County are getting a massive boost in funding. The 9th Annual Compass Run for Food, held by the Compass Community Church on Saturday (June 11) exceeded its goal of $75,000, which will go a long way in combatting food insecurity locally. After two years without an in-person event, it was great to see hundreds of people unite under a common goal of ensuring people in Dufferin County don\u2019t go hungry, said event organizer David Marshall.\nLinda Banks gets recognized as Orangeville\u2019s 2022 Senior of the Year.\nSome Caledon residents and Orangeville councillor Lisa Post are expressing dismay that a mural celebrating the contributions of Post\u2019s grandfather, Alex Raeburn, has been painted over at Caledon Central Public School.\u00a0\n\nRaeburn (1912-2012) was a fourth-generation resident of Caledon Village and involved in many projects in the community. He served on the local school board, was a charter member of Caledon Town Council and Peel Regional Council, and served two terms on the Niagara Escarpment Commission, among other community involvements. Perhaps most relevant to this story is the big part he played in getting Caledon Central Public School built.\n\nAccording to Peel District School Board trustee Stan Cameron, just before 10 a.m. on June 3 he received a call from Caledon Central\u2019s principal letting him know the mural of Raeburn \u2014 located in the library at Caledon Central that\u2019s named after him \u2014 had been painted over. Cameron said in the call, he asked why it was painted over and never got a solid reason. He also asked what the plan for the wall was now that it\u2019s a blank slate again, and the response was that there wasn\u2019t a definitive plan yet.\n\nHeadwaters Health Care Centre president and CEO, Kim Delahunt released the following statement last Friday (June 10) regarding the hospital\u2019s decision to maintain mask requirements after the mandate expired last Saturday (June 11).\n\nJune 23\n\nAn in-person celebration of all backgrounds, ages, religions and sexual orientations returned to Mill Street on Saturday (June 18) for Celebrate Your Awesome\u2019s annual Pride and Diversity Day. It\u2019s the first time in two years a celebration\u2019s been held at Mill Street, with the annual event being marked virtually in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic. This year\u2019s turnout was fantastic, surpassing attendance numbers from 2018 and 2019.\u00a0\nRoughly 3,000 to 4,000 people filled out the stands at the Orangeville Fairgrounds on June 18 and 19, as they enjoyed a variety of competitions, including bull riding, barrel racing, bucking horse, steer riding and pole bending for Ram Rodeo. But the two-day event wasn\u2019t just for entertainment, the event also generated around $10,000, split between Tuff Therapeutic Riding in Mono and the 85 Tornado Squadron Air Cadets of Grand Valley.\nHeadwater\u2019s Health Care Centre (HHCC) honoured two award recipients for their commitment to service at the local hospital during their Annual General Meeting held on Tuesday (June 21). HHCC Board of Directors vice chair, Shelley Scriver presented the 23rd annual Dr. David Scott Award to the laboratory team at Headwaters for their service during the pandemic processing swabs for COVID-19.\nOrangeville Council recently approved the site and floor plan for its nearly 30,000 sq. ft fire station that\u2019s being built at the corner of Commerce and Centennial Road.\n\nIn a unanimous vote on June 13, Council also directed Town staff to prepare an application for capital funding in the amount of $5 million from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities Green Municipal Fund Program to design the new fire station to net zero standards. As well, Council directed staff to include $5 million in additional funds for the fire station project for their 2023-24 capital budget.\n\nThe expected completion date of the fire station is the spring of 2024, with an 18-month construction timeline.\n\nWellington-Dufferin-Guelph (WDG) Public Health has reported the first case of monkeypox in the region. In a press release issued on June 16, the local health unit said they had received confirmation of the first local case of the virus, and that the affected individual is a male aged 20 to 30 who lives in Guelph.\n\nJune 30\n\nParking on both sides of the street will soon be a thing of the past for many roadways currently allowing it in Orangeville. Council unanimously approved a motion that restricts parking to one side of the street during a meeting on Monday (June 27).\n\nStreets that currently do not allow parking on either side or are already restricted to one side won\u2019t be impacted. Same with streets that have parking stalls.\n\nDufferin-Caledon MPP Sylvia Jones has been appointed as Ontario\u2019s newest Health Minister. Premier Doug Ford unveiled his 30-person cabinet last Friday (June 24) during his swearing-in ceremony at Queen\u2019s Park as the 26th premier of the province. Jones is taking over the role of minister of health from Christine Elliott, who did not seek re-election. Jones was also named deputy premier.\n\n\n\nReaders Comments (0)\n\n\n\nName (required)\n\n\nEmail Address (required)\n\n\nWebsite (optional)\n\n\nPlease note: Comment moderation is enabled and may delay your comment.

Disclosure information is available on the original site.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nAuthor: Nicolette Little, Critical Media Studies Instructor and PhD Candidate, University of Calgary\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard of #MeToo, founded by Tarana Burke. And in 2017, actress Alyssa Milano tweeted, \u201cif you\u2019ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write \u2018me too\u2019 as a reply to this tweet.\u201d Her tweet sparked a whirlwind of social media posts that highlighted a gender-based violence crisis.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nTRENDING\nPoilievre would repeal online harms bill after PBO report finds $200 million in new bureaucracy\nCanada Revenue Agency posts, then deletes, series of tweets related to animated film series\nJustin Bieber set to earn $10M performing at pre-wedding bash in India\nHow Nova Scotia nearly got away to become part of the United States\nBruce Pardy: Corporate Canada betrayed capitalism. Now it has been betrayed\nArticle content\n\nWhile hashtag activism and Hollywood are synonymous with gender-based violence advocacy, there are dynamic projects raising awareness across Canada. Metis artist Jaime Black\u2019s REDress Project and Leah Parsons\u2019 Memory Stones Project are examples of such creative and collaborative anti-violence efforts.\n\nThe REDress Project sees red dresses suspended where you would least expect them. Black is an artist-activist \u2014 or \u201cartivist\u201d \u2014 from Winnipeg, Man., who started the project in order to call attention to Canada\u2019s Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) crisis. The crisis has seen thousands of Indigenous women go missing or be killed since the 1970s.\n\nIn the Memory Stones Project, Parsons collects stones from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean, then paints them with bright colours and cheerful symbols to honour her daughter, Rehtaeh. Rehtaeh died by suicide after she was allegedly sexually assaulted by four boys and relentlessly victim-blamed. Each memory stone is hidden outdoors with a note that describes Rehtaeh\u2019s experience. It urges anyone who finds the stone to \u201cshow kindness not hate\u201d to survivors and \u201cleave the stone\u201d to share Rehtaeh\u2019s message with others.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nAs the Government of Canada points out, certain people including \u201cwomen; young women and girls; Indigenous women and girls; LGBTQIA2S+; transgender and gender diverse people; women living in Northern, rural and remote communities; and, women living with disabilities\u201d are more likely to experience gender-based violence.\n\nIn Canada, one in four women report gender-based violence to authorities, while many cases go unreported due to fear of stigma and victim-blaming. Indigenous women in particular face gender-based violence 16 times more than white women in Canada do. They also experience more severe assaults.\n\nAfter interviewing Black and Parsons for my research, studying their projects and speaking with people who engaged with them, what stands out is how both projects attract eager co-operation from everyday people \u2014 which is important for raising awareness.\n\nWhen activists use materials that anyone can acquire, and invite citizens to co-create alongside them, it inspires people to jump on board.\n\nCollaborative activism\n\nDuring my conversations with Black and Parsons, they both mentioned being fed up with the normalization of gender-based violence, so they struck out on their own to address it. While these acts appear to be singular undertakings, they\u2019ve both inspired impressive participation.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe REDress Project gained international attention, but its collaborative origins are little known. In 2010, Black called on Canadians to donate dresses and received over 600 garments. She told me that people have donated every dress she\u2019s used since.\n\nREDress-inspired projects regularly pop up. An Edmontonian started a \u201cREDress Photography Project\u201d in 2015, while Inuit installed a Red Amautiit Project in Nunavut in 2019. These creators, who were inspired by Black\u2019s work, ensured first that she would be comfortable with them building on her idea. In fact, Black tells me she believes in \u201cdecolonizing the idea of art being exclusive.\u201d She believes that this helps it \u201cgrow and evolve beyond its maker.\u201d\n\nParsons\u2019 Memory Stones Project also inspires engagement. After seeing memory stones on the Angel Rehtaeh Parsons Facebook page, people request stones so they can place them too.\n\nParsons tells me she\u2019s painted thousands of memory stones to date, mailing them to people in \u201cmany places \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Africa, China, Alaska, British Columbia, California, Germany, New Zealand, Dakar, Cambodia and more\u201d. She instructs recipients to place the stone somewhere that speaks to them and send Parsons a photograph.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nMy interviews with people who have come across Parsons\u2019 stones revealed that finding the stone helped them reflect on the importance of consent. By placing stones and sharing Rehtaeh\u2019s story, people are helping draw attention to gender-based violence.\n\nReplicability\n\nThese activisms\u2019 uptake, in part, relies on the fact that they are easy to replicate. Black uses an everyday item, dresses, to raise awareness. Parsons uses stones, paint and varnish, which are easily acquired.\n\nThese projects demonstrate that with inspiration, people can use accessible objects and skills they already have to participate in anti-violence activism.\n\nBlack\u2019s and Parsons\u2019 initiatives were meant to inspire involvement. Black invites Canadians to hang their own red dresses to raise awareness and Parsons not only provides stones to people who request them, but encourages them to get involved through social media. On her Facebook page, she gives a blessing and instructions to those who want to paint stones at home and asks people to post photos online.\n\nBecause gender-based violence kills a woman every second day in Canada, it can feel overwhelming to try to address it. This is one of the reasons projects that are easy to participate in and reproduce, and that make people feel like they are part of a community that cares, are important.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nNicolette Little receives funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

So, for us, this funding from the Comox Valley Community Foundation, has been a lifesaver.\u201d\n\nUnbroken Chain ensures people with lived or living experience and their families and friends, have a listening ear when they need it most and receive trauma-informed and culturally safe support. The practice reduces harm and creates a judgment-free environment that facilitates and promotes empowerment, self-autonomy, and healing.\n\nUnbroken Chain hosts awareness events and participates in community action meetings to ensure Indigenous voices and those with lived experience are a part of local solutions, a key factor to reducing stigma and harm.\n\nThe toxic drug epidemic affects the entire community.\n\nIn February, the First Nations Health Authority released information showing COVID-19 pandemic and the toxic drug public health emergency shortened the life expectancy of Indigenous people in B.C. by 7.1 years, between 2015 to 2021.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing illicit substance use more visibly now due to the supply of illicit substances becoming increasingly more and more toxic since the pandemic, but it\u2019s always been there and often behind closed doors,\u201d she said. \u201cDozens and dozens of people have died in our community. You are fortunate if you haven\u2019t had a family member or loved one affected by it.\u201d\n\nIn the last year, the Society\u2019s events have seen an increase of families wanting to ensure they \u2014 and their children \u2014 know how to use naloxone.\n\nAlvarado encourages the community to attend awareness events, such as Red Dress Day, May 5.\n\n\u201cBeing a part of the Indigenous Women\u2019s Sharing Society has been a very welcoming experience. We have a lot of circles and activities where we welcome anyone to join us.\u201d\n\nWith additional funding, volunteers and capacity building, Alvarado hopes to expand toxic drug crisis support services locally and on the North Island.\n\n\u201cUnbroken Chain does have a waiting list,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, we\u2019re not able to help everyone due to the limited resources and the need is great.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about the Indigenous Women\u2019s Sharing Society, follow them on social media, or call 250-338-3455.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n\u2022 Fight the stigma.

EDT\n\n**CHIEFS OF ONTARIO NEWS RELEASE**\n\nToday, Ontario Regional Chief RoseAnne Archibald and Chiefs of Ontario stand in support and honour the lives of Missing and Murder Indigenous Women, Girls, Two Spirit, and Trans and their families and communities this October 4th, the 13th Annual Sisters in Spirit Day.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Sisters in Spirit vigils are being held across Canada today to commemorate and raise awareness for those Indigenous women that have gone missing or murdered. The high rates of Missing and Murder Indigenous Women and Girls in Canada are staggering and have tremendous emotional and spiritual impacts on First Nations families, youth and communities. October 4th is not only devoted to educational awareness, but also a day for our communities and nations to come together and heal.\n\n\u201cWe are standing behind the families today as we keep the MMIWG2ST in our hearts.

She was charged with second-degree murder and indignity to a dead body.\n\nLouie, a member of Osoyoos Indian Band (OIB), was 26 years old and the mother of Robotti\u2019s great-grandson. Robotti is originally from Italy.\n\nAccording to the Parole Board of Canada\u2019s decision in granting Robotti day parole \u2014 which was made official in December 2023 \u2014 Robotti struck Louie multiple times in the head with a crowbar following a dispute over the care of Louie\u2019s child, which occurred in the presence of the child at Robotti\u2019s home in snpink\u2019tn (Penticton).\n\n\u201cYou struck the victim multiple times to the head and face, more than what was necessary to merely provide for your own safety,\u201d the Parole Board wrote to Robotti in their decision.\n\nAfter the incident, Robotti enlisted the help of her brother, Pier, to hide Louie\u2019s body. A court heard during her trial that the siblings carried Louie\u2019s body into a car, drove to a secluded forested area in the nearby community of Naramata, and dumped her body down an embankment.\n\nThe Parole Board\u2019s decision goes on to tell Robotti: \u201cFrom the outset of your sentence, you have expressed genuine remorse for your actions. Through successful completion of programming, you have made significant gains in your ability to take responsibility and accountability.\u201d\n\nA special condition for her day parole was imposed, where she is not to have any direct or indirect contact with Louie\u2019s family, \u201cunless with the prior written authorization of your Parole Officer,\u201d the decision states.\n\n\u201cYou were able to identify how your offence is likely to have undermined the sense of safety Indigenous people may feel.\u201d\n\nThe Parole Board ultimately decided that Robotti\u2019s risk to society while on day parole \u201cwould not be undue\u201d and would \u201ccontribute to your reintegration as a law-abiding citizen.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a result of your good institutional behaviour and your program performance you also improved upon your correctional plan ratings. Your progress is a risk mitigating consideration,\u201d the decision adds.\n\nWhen Robotti was sentenced in 2017, the court ruled that she would not be eligible for parole for 10 years. Yet, the Parole Board\u2019s decision in granting day parole to Robotti comes six years into her sentence.\n\n\u201cUnder the law, all offenders in federal custody, including those serving life sentences, are eligible for parole consideration at some point in their sentence,\u201d the Parole Board of Canada wrote in a statement to IndigiNews.\n\nThe statement attributed to Lisa Saether, the Parole Board\u2019s Pacific regional manager of community relations, also noted that people serving life sentences are eligible to apply for day parole three years before their full parole eligibility date.\n\nThe Parole Board had also approved multiple escorted temporary absences (ETAs) for Robotti in July 2021 and December 2022. She was assessed as a minimum-security offender in February 2022, and has been housed at a minimum-security institution since March 2022. Prior to being granted day parole, she was accepted for day parole destinations at two undisclosed local community residential facilities.\n\nIn making decisions, the Parole Board said that their members \u201cconsider all relevant available information related to the offender\u2019s case,\u201d such as the nature and gravity of the offence; information obtained from victims, the offender and other components of the criminal justice system; and including assessments provided by correctional authorities.\n\nHowever, in Wilson\u2019s petition, she writes that the decision to grant parole was \u201cbased only on (Robotti\u2019s) own self serving submissions and behaviour in a restricted environment \u201c\n\n\u201cFamily and community are outraged at the circumstances that allowed Ms. Robotti to make submissions while the family was not notified or given an opportunity to make submissions,\u201d she writes.\n\nMany syilx community members, including Marty Marchand, learned about Robotti\u2019s granted day parole through local media coverage.\n\n\u201c(The Parole Board) never even contacted any of Roxanne\u2019s family or any of those who had a victim impact letter,\u201d said Marchand, who was a friend of Louie.\n\n\u201cThey never even contacted one person to inform them that Grace was applying for day parole and then was granted it.\u201d\n\nWilson called it \u201cthe height of incompetence and of insults.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how they can justify making that decision based on her submissions only,\u201d she said. \u201cI would\u2019ve picked up the phone and talked to someone in the family.\u201d\n\nIndividuals have to be registered as victims in order to receive information about the offender who harmed them \u2014 such as parole date hearings, which they are able to attend virtually or in-person, the Parole Board\u2019s statement said.\n\nAt parole hearings, victims can outline any \u201ccontinuing physical, emotional or financial impact the offence has had on them.\u201d They can also request that the Parole Board consider that certain special conditions be imposed on the offender\u2019s release.\n\nThe Parole Board\u2019s statement pointed out that people can register as victims through the Parole Board\u2019s online \u201cVictims Portal,\u201d or by completing a registration form with the Parole Board or Correctional Service Canada.\n\n\u201cVictims may provide information to the PBC at any time related to safety concerns, the offender\u2019s risk to re-offend and/or the effect the crime has had on them, their family, or the community,\u201d the Parole Board\u2019s statement added.\n\n\u201cWhile I can appreciate how concerning it can be to victims, their family and the community when an offender is granted a form of conditional release, I can assure you that public safety is always the paramount consideration in all PBC decisions.\u201d\n\n\u2018Disgrace for the criminal justice system\u2019\n\nOn January 5, around 70 people from the community came together, drummed and marched to the snpink\u2019tn courthouse to denounce the Parole Board\u2019s decision. syilx leadership and local government joined family members in expressing \u201cdisgrace for the criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nAt the time of her murder, Louie had been living in \u201cVancouver\u201d and was visiting family and friends in snpink\u2019tn for the holidays.\n\n\u201cIt was her first year down there for fashion school,\u201d said Wilson.\n\n\u201cAs a little girl, that\u2019s all she did was draw \u2014 draw pretty dresses and look at pretty dresses.\u201d\n\nShe remembers how her daughters, with their kids, would regularly go to the beach in snpink\u2019tn with Louie and her child when she was living there.\n\n\u201cShe was just a joy,\u201d said Wilson.\n\n\u201cAnd then you see her with her kid, you go, \u2018Wow, I just love seeing that.\u2019 I just loved seeing it.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Louie and her child\u2019s father Dylan Spence, who is the grandson of Robotti, became \u201cestranged after a violent incident,\u201d according to local media coverage of the trial, leading to a bitter custody battle between the two families over the child.\n\nWilson said she spent years helping Louie by acting as her legal advisor as she was dealing with such issues.\n\n\u201cWe knew for years (Robotti) was threatening her. I advised her during all the times that they applied for custody, when they called the Ministry of Children and Family Development (MCFD) on her,\u201d said Wilson, who launched the petition shortly after the rally for Louie.\n\n\u201cI was her legal advocate at that time, so I knew what she was afraid of.\u201d\n\nThe goal of Wilson\u2019s petition is 500 signatures, and even if that\u2019s met, she said that she has little faith in the Parole Board reversing their day parole decision for Robotti.\n\n\u201cShe isn\u2019t a danger to any other white person, so they\u2019ll forget about her. There will be no impact, not even a ripple, for what she did in her circles,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter Louie\u2019s death, a court heard that the Robottis scattered her belongings and the murder weapon in dumpsters strewn throughout the city, before reporting her missing. About a week later, they turned themselves into the police when Pier revealed the offence to multiple people.\n\nFriends and family of Louie believe that she might have still been alive during the ordeal.\n\n\u201cThere were handprints on the tree, like she was trying to get up and get out. This is the treatment of our people,\u201d said Marchand, who organized the rally in her honour last month.\n\nThe night before she died, Wilson said Louie had told her cousin that, \u201cthe only thing they have left to do is kill me, because they want the boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was the end of that fight \u2013 (Louie) had to go to court to be able to take her son to Vancouver. And (the Robottis) lost that. So her fears \u2014 and my fears as her advocate \u2014 went sky high when that happened.\u201d\n\nWilson said that she wasn\u2019t surprised by the Parole Board\u2019s outcome, calling it a reflection of systemic issues within the \u201cCanadian\u201d justice system.\n\n\u201cThe two-tier system is really, really evident sometimes,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also criticized the Parole Board\u2019s tender treatment of Robotti, arguing that had the roles been reversed, Louie would have no chance at parole.\n\n\u201cThis would not happen to an Indian. This just would not happen if this was an Indian person. Everybody knows that,\u201d she said.\n\nMarchand shared similar sentiments.\n\n\u201cIf I committed that crime, we wouldn\u2019t be getting that treatment. And I know that because my skin is brown,\u201d said Marchand.\n\nBoth Wilson and Marchand said that they intend on keeping Louie\u2019s memory alive and calling attention to the injustices towards her.\n\nWilson said she wants to leave copies of the petition at local band offices, and hopes to meet with chiefs and councils across the Okanagan to discuss justice for Louie.\n\n\u201cJust the pain of losing a bright light. It\u2019s someone you look at and smile. You go, \u2018Man \u2026 she\u2019s done good for herself,\u201d said Wilson.\n\n\u201cShe was just different.\u201d\n\n\n\n Share Tweet Share Email Share\nSend your comments, news tips, typos, letter to the editor, photos and videos to news@KamloopsNow.com.\n\n\n2\nminutes\nIain Burns \u2022 Jul 4, 12:40pm\nNational News \u00a0\nChrystia Freeland: Liberals have got the message \u2013 Canadians want us to make their lives easier\nShe also said Justin Trudeau has her \"full support.\"\n4 min read\nProvincial \u00a0\nIn otter news, orphaned BC pup is thriving but unlikely to return to wild\n\"She's made a few attempts, but she can't dive yet.\"\nCanadian Press \u2022 Jul 4, 05:23am\n2 min read\nKamloops \u00a0\nKamloops RCMP seek witnesses of shooting, 2 burned out vehicles found\n\u201cInvestigators believe the shooting was targeted and related to the BC Gang Conflict.\"\nCheyanna Lorraine \u2022 Jul 4, 01:30pm\n4 min read\nNational News \u00a0\nTrudeau government's plan to police speech will cost more than $200M over 5 years: PBO\nIf passed, the law would create a new regulator that could force social media firms to remove what the government considers hurtful content.\nIain Burns \u2022 Jul 4, 11:00am\n2 min read\nLocal Sports \u00a0 Blazers \u00a0\nBlazers select Czech forward Vit Zahejsky with 2nd overall pick in CHL Import Draft\nZahejsky will join fellow countryman Matteo Koci as the import players on the Blazers roster.\nJosh Duncan \u2022 Jul 4, 08:55am\n\n\n28\u00b0\nThu\n30\u2103\nFri\n32\u2103\nSat\n33\u2103\nSun\n37\u2103\nMon\n40\u2103\nTue\n40\u2103\n\n\nTOP STORIES\nSenior, 84, accused of shooting teenager on his rural property\nBC nurse suspended for 3 days after drinking on shift, practising while drunk\nChefs mourn Okanagan's lost peaches but find ways to adapt amid stone fruit wipeout\nShirtless, intoxicated BC Interior man chooses drunk tank over going home with wife\nSearch for missing man in BC enters third day, residents asked to check sheds\nBC RCMP recover stolen vehicle, arrest female suspect\n\u2018A beacon of light\u2019: Helicopter pilot dies while battling wildfire in NWT\nSuspect's pants catch fire in arson attempt gone wrong: BC RCMP\nFOLLOW US\n   \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n"},

Questions, and uncertainty, and darkness about them. We all would like to know, we'd like to like find them, if possible, but the reality of it is, they\u2019re not coming back. Seeing this here too, kind of opens your eyes as to what's going on even in our own communities that we live in - that we feel safe in.\"\u00a0\n\nHe added there is a call to action to work towards reconciliation coming from this kind of representation of marginalized people who often find themselves in vulnerable situations to make ends meet. \u00a0\n\n\"I think this red dress representation speaks to us to look after our young women, and to try to find where they are, and to respect them. They carry the community, from what I'm taught in my culture. Women are the givers of the world.\"\u00a0\n\nAs an Educational Assistant in Maple Leaf School, Meekis was thrilled to see the artwork and student involvement added to the exhibit.\u00a0\n\n\"The part that I like about it is, you teach children at an early age to do something, it sticks with them all their lives, and they learn that respect and they learn to respect each other, they learn to treat each other in a certain way. If we could reach one child with what we're doing today, I think we can say that we're making this world a better place. \"\u00a0\n\nThis year, a section of local people who are murdered or missing was added to the display, including dresses with names embroidered on them and a table sharing the story of one woman and her unborn child, who were murdered.\u00a0\n\nOne of the PVRDP organizers, Carolyn Wiebe, acknowledged there are more names out there.\u00a0\n\n\"I think one of the things that we wanted to come out of this as well, is that there's probably other families out there that we don't realize that they have a missing or murdered loved one, and hopefully they'll come forward.\" \u00a0\n\nAdded to the event this year was an outdoor classroom made of tree stumps covered in Orange T-Shirts with children's shoes and boots lining the perimeter with an Every Child Matters flag blowing in the wind.\u00a0\n\nTrish Meekis teaches a grade 5/6 split class at Ecole Morden Middle School. They learned about MMIW in school and added work to the exhibit. \u00a0\n\n\"As a class, we have had numerous discussions about Indigenous issues over the last year together. Some of my students have connections to share and they are all open to learning and contributing to the idea of reconciliation. My students each created an art piece with an outline of a woman in a red dress and wrote some messages of strength on them. They were very proud of their work and the fact that they would be added to such a powerful exhibit at Morden Park. It is so amazing to see the compassion and concern they have, as well as the willingness to be open to learning more about our Canadian history. I hope the learning will continue for all of the students, and that they will carry the lessons taught with them throughout their lives. The Red Dress Exhibit is such an important event and I am so proud to be a part of this year!\" \u00a0\n\nGenesis House had a representative at the Red Dress Project, and submitted a statement of support for the exhibit and what it means to them. \u00a0\n\n\"Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls is a human rights crisis. It disproportionately affects Indigenous peoples across Canada and the United States. \u00a0They are disproportionately affected by all forms of violence. At Genesis House, we consider physical, emotional and sexual violence towards another should be the concern of all members of society. Genesis House will stand alongside our community and nation as an ally.\" \u00a0\n\nThe next installment of the PV Red Dress Project will be in Winkler at the Winkler Arts and Culture building on Saturday May 21st from 10am-3pm, then in Killarney and Crystal City the following weekends.

We don\u2019t have the equipment for people to go out and look.\u201d\n\nThe fundraising efforts will give participating stores and businesses a stack of paper red dress cut-outs that will be offered to customers during the time of payment.\n\nIf a customer would like to donate, they can buy a dress, sign it and the establishment will hang it on display.\n\nThe inaugural funds will go towards search efforts for Charles, who is a mother of four daughters, then hopefully branch off to support other families.\n\n\u201cMy long term vision for missing and murdered women is setting up a missing persons office,\u201d Thomas says.\n\nShe adds she would like to see First Nations youth work at the facility to take tips from anyone who has information.\n\n\u201cThey can have some sort of liaison that is always involved with the families and the tips that are coming in. There\u2019s probably some people that want to talk and tell where they (a missing or murdered person) are. They don\u2019t know who to talk to; they aren\u2019t always willing to talk to the RCMP or city police because of the communication barrier.\u201d\n\nThomas would like to see the campaign become an annual event.\n\nIdeally, small local companies and big corporations would take part in the efforts.\n\nShe says that any business that would like to take part can fill out an order form and she and other volunteers will hand cut the dresses to be offered to customers.\n\nOnce the campaign has concluded, the participating businesses will send the Happy Mary Charles fundraiser a cheque for the donations.\n\nThe second annual Happy Charles Awareness and Healing walk is slated to take place May 4 \u2013 12 where Charles\u2019 family members will walk from Prince Albert to La Ronge.\n\nThey are accepting donations of food and water during their walk north on Highway 2.\n\nThe group will walk 30 kilometres a day and sleep in tents during the night.\n\n\u201cHappy\u2019s daughters are always in tears because they miss their mom,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that by having this Red Dress (campaign) that there is always some sort of funds or some sort of awareness.\u201d\n\n(PHOTO: Red dress cut outs from the 2nd Annual Awareness Walk for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women.

She was charged with second-degree murder and indignity to a dead body.\u00a0\n\nLouie, a member of Osoyoos Indian Band (OIB), was 26 years old and the mother of Robotti\u2019s great-grandson. Robotti is originally from Italy.\n\nAccording to the Parole Board of Canada\u2019s decision in granting Robotti day parole \u2014 which was made official in December 2023 \u2014 Robotti struck Louie multiple times in the head with a crowbar following a dispute over the care of Louie\u2019s child, which occurred in the presence of the child at Robotti\u2019s home in Penticton (snpink\u2019tn).\n\n\u201cYou struck the victim multiple times to the head and face, more than what was necessary to merely provide for your own safety,\u201d the Parole Board wrote to Robotti in their decision.\n\nAfter the incident, Robotti enlisted the help of her brother, Pier, to hide Louie\u2019s body. A court heard during her trial that the siblings carried Louie\u2019s body into a car, drove to a secluded forested area in the nearby community of Naramata, and dumped her body down an embankment.\u00a0\n\nThe Parole Board\u2019s decision goes on to tell Robotti: \u201cFrom the outset of your sentence, you have expressed genuine remorse for your actions. Through successful completion of programming, you have made significant gains in your ability to take responsibility and accountability.\u201d\n\nA special condition for her day parole was imposed, where she is not to have any direct or indirect contact with Louie\u2019s family, \u201cunless with the prior written authorization of your Parole Officer,\u201d the decision states.\n\n\u201cYou were able to identify how your offence is likely to have undermined the sense of safety Indigenous people may feel.\u201d\n\nThe Parole Board ultimately decided that Robotti\u2019s risk to society while on day parole \u201cwould not be undue\u201d and would \u201ccontribute to your reintegration as a law-abiding citizen.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a result of your good institutional behaviour and your program performance you also improved upon your correctional plan ratings. Your progress is a risk mitigating consideration,\u201d the decision adds.\n\nWhen Robotti was sentenced in 2017, the court ruled that she would not be eligible for parole for 10 years. Yet, the Parole Board\u2019s decision in granting day parole to Robotti comes six years into her sentence.\u00a0\n\n\u201cUnder the law, all offenders in federal custody, including those serving life sentences, are eligible for parole consideration at some point in their sentence,\u201d the Parole Board of Canada wrote in a statement to IndigiNews.\n\nThe statement attributed to Lisa Saether, the Parole Board\u2019s Pacific regional manager of community relations, also noted that people serving life sentences are eligible to apply for day parole three years before their full parole eligibility date.\n\nThe Parole Board had also approved multiple escorted temporary absences (ETAs) for Robotti in July 2021 and December 2022. She was assessed as a minimum-security offender in February 2022, and has been housed at a minimum-security institution since March 2022. Prior to being granted day parole, she was accepted for day parole destinations at two undisclosed local community residential facilities.\n\nIn making decisions, the Parole Board said that their members \u201cconsider all relevant available information related to the offender\u2019s case,\u201d such as the nature and gravity of the offence; information obtained from victims, the offender and other components of the criminal justice system; and including assessments provided by correctional authorities.\n\nHowever, in Wilson\u2019s petition, she writes that the decision to grant parole was \u201cbased only on (Robotti\u2019s) own self serving submissions and behaviour in a restricted environment \u201c\n\n\u201cFamily and community are outraged at the circumstances that allowed Ms. Robotti to make submissions while the family was not notified or given an opportunity to make submissions,\u201d she writes.\n\nMany syilx community members, including Marty Marchand, learned about Robotti\u2019s granted day parole through local media coverage.\u00a0\n\n\u201c(The Parole Board) never even contacted any of Roxanne\u2019s family or any of those who had a victim impact letter,\u201d said Marchand, who was a friend of Louie.\n\n\u201cThey never even contacted one person to inform them that Grace was applying for day parole and then was granted it.\u201d\n\nWilson called it \u201cthe height of incompetence and of insults.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how they can justify making that decision based on her submissions only,\u201d she said. \u201cI would\u2019ve picked up the phone and talked to someone in the family.\u201d\n\nIndividuals have to be registered as victims in order to receive information about the offender who harmed them \u2014 such as parole date hearings, which they are able to attend virtually or in-person, the Parole Board\u2019s statement said.\n\nAt parole hearings, victims can outline any \u201ccontinuing physical, emotional or financial impact the offence has had on them.\u201d They can also request that the Parole Board consider that certain special conditions be imposed on the offender\u2019s release.\n\nThe Parole Board\u2019s statement pointed out that people can register as victims through the Parole Board\u2019s online \u201cVictims Portal,\u201d or by completing a registration form with the Parole Board or Correctional Service Canada. \u00a0\n\n\u201cVictims may provide information to the PBC at any time related to safety concerns, the offender\u2019s risk to re-offend and/or the effect the crime has had on them, their family, or the community,\u201d the Parole Board\u2019s statement added.\n\n\u201cWhile I can appreciate how concerning it can be to victims, their family and the community when an offender is granted a form of conditional release, I can assure you that public safety is always the paramount consideration in all PBC decisions.\u201d\n\n\u2018Disgrace for the criminal justice system\u2019\n\nOn January 5, around 70 people from the community came together, drummed and marched to the Penticton (snpink\u2019tn) courthouse to denounce the Parole Board\u2019s decision. syilx leadership and local government joined family members in expressing \u201cdisgrace for the criminal justice system.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAt the time of her murder, Louie had been living in Vancouver and was visiting family and friends in the city for the holidays.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt was her first year down there for fashion school,\u201d said Wilson.\n\n\u201cAs a little girl, that\u2019s all she did was draw \u2014 draw pretty dresses and look at pretty dresses.\u201d\n\nShe remembers how her daughters, with their kids, would regularly go to the beach with Louie and her child when she was living there.\u00a0\n\n\u201cShe was just a joy,\u201d said Wilson.\n\n\u201cAnd then you see her with her kid, you go, \u2018Wow, I just love seeing that.\u2019 I just loved seeing it.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Louie and her child\u2019s father Dylan Spence, who is the grandson of Robotti, became \u201cestranged after a violent incident,\u201d according to local media coverage of the trial, leading to a bitter custody battle between the two families over the child.\n\nWilson said she spent years helping Louie by acting as her legal advisor as she was dealing with such issues.\n\n\u201cWe knew for years (Robotti) was threatening her. I advised her during all the times that they applied for custody, when they called the Ministry of Children and Family Development (MCFD) on her,\u201d said Wilson, who launched the petition shortly after the rally for Louie.\n\n\u201cI was her legal advocate at that time, so I knew what she was afraid of.\u201d\n\nThe goal of Wilson\u2019s petition is 500 signatures, and even if that\u2019s met, she said that she has little faith in the Parole Board reversing their day parole decision for Robotti.\n\n\u201cShe isn\u2019t a danger to any other white person, so they\u2019ll forget about her. There will be no impact, not even a ripple, for what she did in her circles,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter Louie\u2019s death, a court heard that the Robottis scattered her belongings and the murder weapon in dumpsters strewn throughout the city, before reporting her missing. About a week later, they turned themselves into the police when Pier revealed the offence to multiple people.\u00a0\n\nFriends and family of Louie believe that she might have still been alive during the ordeal.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere were handprints on the tree, like she was trying to get up and get out. This is the treatment of our people,\u201d said Marchand, who organized the rally in her honour last month.\n\nThe night before she died, Wilson said Louie had told her cousin that, \u201cthe only thing they have left to do is kill me, because they want the boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was the end of that fight \u2013 (Louie) had to go to court to be able to take her son to Vancouver. And (the Robottis) lost that. So her fears \u2014 and my fears as her advocate \u2014 went sky high when that happened.\u201d\n\nWilson said that she wasn\u2019t surprised by the Parole Board\u2019s outcome, calling it a reflection of systemic issues within the \u201cCanadian\u201d justice system.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe two-tier system is really, really evident sometimes,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\nShe also criticized the Parole Board\u2019s tender treatment of Robotti, arguing that had the roles been reversed, Louie would have no chance at parole.\n\n\u201cThis would not happen to an Indian. This just would not happen if this was an Indian person. Everybody knows that,\u201d she said.\n\nMarchand shared similar sentiments.\n\n\u201cIf I committed that crime, we wouldn\u2019t be getting that treatment. And I know that because my skin is brown,\u201d said Marchand.\n\nBoth Wilson and Marchand said that they intend on keeping Louie\u2019s memory alive and calling attention to the injustices towards her.\u00a0\n\nWilson said she wants to leave copies of the petition at local band offices, and hopes to meet with chiefs and councils across the Okanagan to discuss justice for Louie.\u00a0\n\n\u201cJust the pain of losing a bright light. It\u2019s someone you look at and smile.

It is our government's responsibility to ensure justice for missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit people,\" the Native Women\u2019s Association said in a statement on social media Wednesday.\n\nThe report also outlines how homicides of Indigenous women and girls moved through the court system, how they were treated at crucial decision points along the way, and how their outcomes compared with the homicides of non-Indigenous women and girls.\n\nBack to Homepage\n\nTypos\nNews Tips\nForums\n9\nShares\n\nMUST-READ STORIES\n\nGet all the day's most vital news with our newsletter, sent every weekday.\n\n\n\nMore Penticton News\n\n\n\nRECENT STORIES\nAmbushed in failed hit job\nKamloops - 1:46 pm\nHeat warnings issued\nBC Coast - 1:43 pm\nLife in prison for murder\nAbbotsford - 1:39 pm\nA parade of aches and pains\nCalgary - 1:27 pm\nPower restored in Aberdeen\nKamloops - 1:16 pm\nMore Top Stories >\n\n\n\nReal Estate\n3066 Beverly Place\n4 bedrooms 2 baths\n$999,900\nmore details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenticton SPCA Featured Pet\n\n\nLola\nPenticton SPCA >\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBody transformation journeys\nGalleries | July 04, 2024\nVanessa Hudgens gives birth\nShowbiz | July 04, 2024\nBaseball playing pup\nMust Watch | July 04, 2024\nMischievous Beagle caught tearing up the toilet paper\nMust Watch | July 04, 2024\nVintage bathrooms\nGalleries | July 04, 2024\nSouth Okanagan Quick Links\nCity of Penticton\nVisit Penticton\nPenticton Transit\nDiscover Naramata\nOkanagan Falls\nTown of Oliver\nTown of Osoyoos\nTown of Keremeos\nInterior Health\nOkanagan College\nRegional District Okanagan-Similkameen\nPenticton & Wine Country Chamber\nPenticton Discussion Forum\nDistrict of Summerland\nSummerland Chamber & Tourism\nSchool District 67 - Okanagan Skaha\nSchool District 53 - Okanagan Similkameen\nOkanagan Regional Library\nOsoyoos Lake Water Quality Society\nDon't Move a Mussel\n\n\u00a9 2024 Castanet.net Make Castanet Your Homepage News Tips Advertising Contact Us"},

This display, which includes images of the women and girls, acts as a powerful visual representation of the pain and loss felt by the families and friends of victims as well as survivors.\n\nIPB asks members of the OPP as well as the public to reflect and learn more about this ongoing national tragedy. Everyone is encouraged to honour MMIWG by working together to embrace and support community healing.\n\nIn 2019, Vanessa Willow, a resident of Rama First Nation, created and donated a red dress painting to the OPP in honour of the ongoing commitment to address the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. This painting is currently on display as part of the Red Dress Day recognition.\n\nThose passing by OPP General Headquarters (777 Memorial Ave., Orillia) in the evening hours will see the building lit up in red. Please take the opportunity to pause, reflect and be reminded of the love of the families and communities that grieve for missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\n*************************\n\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nMore Local News\n\t'Nightmare': Cyber-attack throws wrench into dealerships' plans\n\tInnisfil taking another look at licences for short-term rentals\n\tIt's official: Orillia's Lightfoot Dr. now signed, bannered\nAdd to the story\nHave a story idea?\nLetter to the editor\nReport a mistake\nAsk a question\nCOMMUNITY POLL\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nWhat is your favourite food to cook on the barbecue?\n Chicken\n Fish\n Hamburgers\n Hot dogs/sausages\n Pork chops\n Steak\n Vegetables\n Veggie burgers\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nLOOK LOCAL: SALES, OFFERS & MORE\nHow Much Does A Central Air Conditioner Cost In 2024?\nDeep Cleaning Services\nHind Quarter Meat Co. - How Did I Become A Butcher?\nBurger Mania is back at Wally Parr Foods!\nDeep Detail Home Cleaning\n\"Premium Quality Sunar Sunflower Oil - 3 Liters - Your Choice for Healthy Cooking!\"\nMost affordable Home cleaning services\nHome & Office Cleaning Services\nHome & Office Cleaning Services\nFresh Picked Strawberries Now Available at Nicholyn Farms Market\nVIEW LISTINGS >\nPOST YOUR OWN SALE OR OFFER >\n  \nNews\nLocal News\nNews Map\nVideo\nPolice Beat\nBeyond Local\nInside the Village\nBehind the Scenes\nOntario News\nCanada\nWorld\nNational Business\nNational Sports\nMore\nWeather\nSpotlight\nWhat's Up Wednesday\nJobs of the Future\nPets & Animals\nColumns\nAdopt Me\nHoroscopes\nComics\nDear Abby\nGames (like Crosswords)\nGas Prices\nGarage Sales\nLetters to the Editor\nVillage Life\nObituaries\nObituaries\nIn Memoriam\nShop\n2023 Reader Favourites\nLocal Business Directory\nFlyers\nAutos\nBeauty and Fashion\nCommunity Leaders Program\nCommunity Organizations\nFinancial Services\nFood\nFuneral and Estate Planning\nGovernment and Education\nHealth and Wellness\nHome Decor\nHome Improvement\nPets\nProfessional Services\nPublic Notices and Tenders\nReal Estate\nRecreation\nShopping and Specialty Stores\nFlyers\nClassifieds\nAll Classifieds\nPost a Free Ad\nItems for Sale\nGarage Sales\nJobs\nLook Local\nMy Account\nJobs\nConnect\nJoin BarrieToday+\nFREE email newsletter\nSupport Local News\nMy Account\nFollow Us on Facebook\nFollow us on Instagram\nFollow Us on Twitter\nOur Supporters\nEvents\n\ud83d\udc9b\nMeet the Team\nCommunity Builders Awards\nRandom Acts of Kindness\nBarrieToday Cares\nMatch Initiatives\nAbout\nAbout Us\nAdvertising\nCommunity Guidelines\nReader Favourites\nContact Us\nPrivacy\nTerms of Service\nJournalistic Principles and Practices\nMedia Kit\nPolitical Ads Registry\nCommunity Leaders Program\nContest Rules\nPartner Content\nVisit our network of sites:\nAuroraToday.ca\nBarrieToday.com\nBayToday.ca\nBradfordToday.ca\nBurlingtonToday.com\nCambridgeToday.ca\nCanadaFlyers.ca\nCollingwoodToday.ca\nElliotLakeToday.com\nEloraFergusToday.com\nFlamboroughToday.com\nGuelphToday.com\nHaltonHillsToday.ca\nInnisfilToday.ca\nMidlandToday.ca\nMiltonToday.ca\nNewmarketToday.ca\nNiagara-on-the-Lake Local\nNorthern Ontario Business\nOakville News\nOntarioFlyers.ca\nOrilliaMatters.com\nPelhamToday.ca\nSooToday.com\nStratfordToday.ca\nSudbury.com\nThoroldToday.ca\nTimminsToday.com\nThe Trillium\nVillage Life\nVillage Report\nAlimoshoToday.com\nLasuToday.com\nSooLeader\n\n\u00a9 2024 BarrieToday.com"},

(Photo: Eva Koch)\nExpand\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just an ordinary day at school for students at Penticton Secondary on Thursday, May 5 \u2014 it was an opportunity to take action on truth and reconciliation.\n\nA total of 25 red dresses were displayed outside of the school to mark the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, and Two-Spirit People.\n\nA conversation about the importance of the occasion among 18 students enrolled in the Land Learn Program began in the classroom, and then continued with the school\u2019s first-ever outdoor Indigenous-themed story walk.\n\n\u201cThey read individual stories in front of each other about people who have lost a loved one, whether it was a daughter, sister, mother, or auntie,\u201d said Patricia Collins, a teacher at Penticton Secondary and leader of the Land Learn Program.\n\nOn a somber, rainy morning in Penticton, students were given the opportunity to not only take action on reconciliation but to also share their personal stories that have been hidden for far too long.\n\n\u201cMultiple students brought a red dress from home to symbolize the violence Indigenous women face,\u201d Collins said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the story walk, students were coming up and telling their own experiences related to violence.\u201d\n\nThe Land Learn Program launched in February as a way to introduce students to Indigenous history through the studying of multiple subjects, like English, math, science and even physical education.\n\nNationally, May 5 is recognized as a day to raise awareness about the lives Indigenous women have lost because of violence \u2014 it is also known as Red Dress Day.\n\nIt\u2019s a day that not many at Penticton Secondary were aware of prior to this week.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know about this day until a few days ago,\u201d said Bella Keith, a student in Grade 11. \u201cSadness comes from me because this isn\u2019t being spread around as much as it should be but I think the conversations that we\u2019re having about what\u2019s happened in the past and what still happens to this day is very important.\u201d\n\nRaising awareness about those who have lost their lives due to violence was a priority throughout the day, with the set up of an information booth headlining the cause. Local teachers Eva Koch, Lisa Stephens, Chris Ward and Russ Reid set up the booth inside the school, making sure the message of truth and reconciliation resonated with more than just those in the Land Learn Program.\n\n\u201cI think a lot more students need to understand what\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d Faythe Berglund said, a Grade 12 student. \u201cFor us to see what these women and their families have gone through\u2026we got to a certain point where I did end up crying.\u201d\n\nThursday marked the first time Penticton Secondary recognized the occasion. Koch, a social studies teacher, said that the school has plans to expand the event over the next five years, with the additions of art exhibits and walking stations among the top ideas.\n\nAn RCMP-led study in 2013 revealed that at that point in time there were 225 unsolved cases of missing or murdered Indigenous females.\n\n\u201cSo many people have gone missing and we don\u2019t talk about them, or even think about them,\u201d said Kaslo Stevenson, a Grade 11 student.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a serious problem. Today gave me an opportunity to reflect on the tragedy, and it\u2019s appropriate that we think about it.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018These are criminal acts\u2019: Penticton Indian Band Chief on residential school discoveries\n\n@lgllockhart\nlogan.lockhart@pentictonwesternnews.com\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\nAbout the Author: Logan Lockhart\n\nRead more\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tVernon cowgirl ropes in B.C.

The history of the Red Dress was shared with the students, explaining it was first observed on May 5th, 2010, and it now happens every year.\n\nEach student learned some safety tips, received a colouring sheet along with a 7 Teachings colouring book, Bear Clan stickers, and an Indigenous Culture Card. The kids were able to look at samples of beading and practiced saying the word \"Miigwech\" which means \"thank you\" in Ojibwa.\n\nWhen asked what they could do for Red Dress Day on May 5th, the students quickly answered \"Wear red and place a red dress in your window\".\n\nNEXT STORY\n2023 is \"middling\" with start-time for producers\nLATEST IN LOCAL NEWS\nLocal daycare receives Diversity and Inclusion grant for Indigenous-style artwork\nMPI adding temporary hail estimating centre\nAnnual planting day at Lions Prairie Manor sees residents enjoy outdoors\nFlooding potential in Portage, with up to 60 mm of rainfall coming\nLATEST STORIES ON PORTAGEONLINE\nScoreboard/Lineup - Friday, May 24th\nFamily Resource Centre announces totals from Smile Cookie Week\nMotorists not slowing down while passing emergency vehicles\nRainfall Warning issued ahead of significant precipitation Thursday night through Saturday morning\nEvents\nTOPS ( Take Of Pounds Sentibly)\nThu, Jul 4, 5:00 PM\nKelly Human Memorial Concert in the Park\nThu, Jul 4, 6:00 PM\nUnit #13 Army Navy Air Force Meat Draw\nThu, Jul 4, 7:00 PM\nSmokey at the Bandit - Movie Night at Second Chance Car Museum\nThu, Jul 4, 7:00 PM\nRathwell Bingo\nThu, Jul 4, 7:30 PM\nView more \nJobs\nPowered by\nExperienced Plumber\nFull-time, Hourly, Skilled Trades\nFeatured\nGround Handler - Full Time\nSkilled Trades, Full-time\nProduction Manager/Sales Manager\nSalary, Skilled Trades, Full-time, Labour, Sales\nPart-time Housekeeper\nEntry-Level, Hospitality, Part-time\nARENA & GOLF COURSE STAFF\nFull-time, Entry-Level, Labour\nView more \nBuy & Sell\nPowered by\nLarge Sectional Couch for Sale\n$650\nFeatured\nHEATED SHOP SPACE/Warehouse/Truck Parking\n$2400\nFeatured\n4 Goodyear Wrangler SR-A Truck Tires\n$400\nDinky Toys made in England, Meccano Ltd\n$5\nDinky Toys made in England, Meccano Ltd\n$5\nView more \nCFRY\nMIX 96.5 FM\nCountry 93.1 FM\nPodcasts\nGet the App\nNEWS\nLocal News\nLocal Sports\nNational News\nCommunity\nFuneral Announcements\nAg News\nSponsored\nWeather\nFEATURES\nEvents\nLocalJobShop\nHelloGoodBuy Classifieds\nGarage Sales\nCFRY Program Guide\nSunday Requests\nRoad Reports and Cancellations\nCFRY General Store\nCONTESTS\nFarmer Appreciation Lunch\nWords that Win\nProject Patio\nCONNECT\nContact Us\nSubmit News\nMeet the Team\nFacebook\nX\nYouTube\nStreaming\nRSS\nAdvertise With Us\nCareers\nContest Rules\nAccessibility\nTerms Of Use Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\nJournalistic Standards"},

Transit covering two-thirds and participating communities the remaining one-third. Stone said that's \"exceptionally generous\" when compared to the more typical arrangement that sees communities cover 45 per cent.\n\nIn addition, $750,000 over three years will be earmarked for a grant program to purchase and operate vehicles; $150,000 over three years for a First Nations driver education program; and $500,000 over two years for safety improvements, including webcams and transit shelters.\n\nThe plan, unveiled in Victoria three weeks after a symposium on the issue was held in Smithers, also calls for an effort to better synchronize schedules and expand user eligibility criteria for existing services.\n\nDetails on how the plan will be implemented will be worked out over the next couple months with the help of a nine-person advisory committee that includes Carrier Sekani Family Services executive director Mary Teegee.\n\nTeegee called the announcement a \"start\" and noted the idea of providing a shuttle service along Highway 16 West was first raised in 2006 in a final report from a previous symposium held in Prince George. It was echoed six years later in the final report from Missing Women Inquiry commissioner Wally Oppal.\n\n\"It's been 10 years where very little has been done so I'm hopeful that this is a beginning,\" Teegee said.\u00a0\n\nIt also remains a far cry from a full-fledged transit system along Highway 16 in Teegee's view.\n\n\"It's not just First Nations people who should be up in arms,\" Teegee said. \"It should be every resident in northern B.C. because it's [about] your right and access to services.\"\n\nStone reiterated the provincial government's position that the idea is a nonstarter.\n\n\"Many have called for more simplistic solutions \u2013 a bus running from one end of the corridor to the other \u2013 that is simply not practical,\" Stone said.\u00a0\n\n\"We were hearing consistently [during the Smithers symposium] from folks along the corridor that what they really need, what they really wanted to see were solutions that were tailored to the needs of their specific community.\"\n\nHe referred to a service operated by the Nak'azdli First Nation in Fort St. James that transports about five people a day, five days a week, to Vanderhoof for medical appointments. Stone said it's used by First Nations and non-First Nations alike and is coordinated by Nak'azdli with \"tremendous support by the local government and the regional district.\"\n\n\"That's a solution that is working very, very well for the communities,\" Stone said.\u00a0\n\nHe said the time taken was \"needed to go through this rigorous process\" and now expects to see the various actions \"either fully in place or well their way\" by April.\u00a0\n\nFunding of $75,000 per year to Carrier Sekani Family Services for the Highway of Tears Initiative will also run out at the end of this year. \"Amazing things\" have been done through the initiative, Teegee said, such as developing a community safety took kit, first responders training and support for victims during the Cody Legebokoff trial.\n\nTeegee is hoping to get funding through the province's civil forfeiture proceeds to keep the program running.\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nReport a mistake\nThis has not been shared.

Hanna Petersen\nListen to this article\n00:02:18\n\nMotorists passing the intersection of Highway 16 and 97 will now be able to see Mr. PG waving the Prince George Red Dress Society's flag.\n\nThis is to recognize\u00a0May 5, which is the \u201cDay of Awareness\u00a0for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-spirit People.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, the City of Prince George officially proclaimed May 5 as a \"Day of Awareness\u00a0for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-spirit People\" as an act of solidarity with the community of Ladysmith, B.C. where a red dress installation was vandalized.\n\nRed Dresses have been widely adopted as a symbol to raise awareness for murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls since M\u00e9tis artist Jamie Black\u2019s 2010 art project.\n\n\u201cWe've raised the flag in support of that, not only to bring awareness within our own community, to be able to hold space for people and to say that's not okay,\u201d said Tammy Miese, president of the Prince George Red Dress Society, who lost her\u00a0childhood best friend Kari Anne Gordon when she went missing and was found murdered in 1998.\n\nMiese has been organizing Red Dress events in Prince George since 2016.\n\n\u201cI have to say that I fills my heart that I'm able to stand here and bring awareness, and it's not just awareness for you and I it's awareness for everybody,\u201d said Miese.\n\n\u201cSo many people don't have a voice to bring that their loved one\u2019s pictures forward, or their names or anything like that. They're still grieving, and they're still getting used getting used to the idea that their loved one is murdered or is missing,\u201d said Brenda Wilson John who has been an advocate for MMIWG for 29 years.\n\n\u201cSo, to have a day where there's awareness\u00a0\u2014\u00a0they can hang a dress up in the window, they can go on walks, or vigils, or they can go to the monument to remember their loved one.\u201d\n\nIn September 2022, the Red Dress Society installed a monument dedicated to MMIWG on the Highway of Tears at the corner of Highway 16 and Ferry Avenue, as part of the annual Red Dress Campaign.\n\nAn awareness 5km walk to mark Red Dress day will also take place on May 5 at 3 p.m. starting at the RCMP detachment on Victoria Street and ending at Cottonwood Island Park.\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nReport a mistake\nReader Feedback 6\n\tSHOW\nThis has been shared 20 times\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nRelated\n\tDocumentary to screen in Prince George for Red Dress Day\n\t\u2018We're not alone anymore\u2019: Prince George unveils Red Dress Society monument\n\tPrince George student bakery raises money for the Red Dress Society\n\tPrince George gives Red Dress Day an official proclamation\n\tPrince George Cougars partnering with Red Dress Society to raise awareness\nPrince George - Featured\nBC's forest cutting permit process handcuffing industry, says Lheidli T'enneh, Simpcw chiefs\nRead More\nCOMMUNITY POLL\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nDo you watch or listen to CBC News once a week or more?\n Often\n Always\n Rarely\n Sometimes\n Never\n\nVOTE RESULTS > ARCHIVES >\n\nTRENDING TODAY\n1\t\nCarrier Lumber president backs First Nations' plea to restore local forest policy decision-making\n\n2\t\nRCMP search for witnesses and footage from June 29 fatal accident\n\n3\t\nRCMP provides update on wanted persons that have now been located\n\n4\t\nRCMP: 16-year-old youth who overdosed last week has died\n\n5\t\nDeciduous Heroes visit Prince George with a message: Forests are at risk\nNews\nHighlights\nLocal News\nLocal Sports\nBritish Columbia\nCanada\nWorld\nAnimal Stories\nOpinion\nOpinion\nSend us a letter\nArts & Life\nLocal Arts\nPhotos and Videos\nFeatures\nGas Prices\nSpecial Features\nWeather\nDigital Edition\nDigital Archive\nSponsored Content\nObituaries\nConnect\nContact Us\nAdvertise with Us\nDaily Headlines Email\nSupport Local News\nCitizen Box Locations\nLocal Events\nAbout\nAdvertising\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nPolitical Ads Registry\nSpecial Features\nDigital Archive\nReaders Choice\n\n\u00a9 2024 Prince George Citizen"},

The Two Sisters totem poles will be erected in Prince George and Prince Rupert at part of the Highway of Tears Commemoration and Healing Totem Pole series.\n\nThe totem pole series, initiated by the families of missing and murdered women and the Indian Residential Schools Survivors Society, will provide places where families can commemorate lost loved ones.\n\nA portion of the funding for the project was provided by the provincial and federal governments, though the federal Universal Broadband Fund and the Connecting British Columbia program.\n\n\u201cAs a local resident and frequent traveller on Highway 16, I know how important this project is for people living, working and travelling along this route,\u201d North Coast MLA Jennifer Rice said in a press release. \u201cOur government is pleased to be able to help fund this project, which helps fulfil recommendations from the\n\nHighway of Tears Symposium, and completion of the project will be a welcome reassurance for families and communities in our region.\u201d\n\nIn November, Rogers announced a partnership with the Coastal First Nations to develop five new cell towers on Haida Gwaii. The towers will provide 100 km of additional coverage along Highway 16 from Masset to Port Clements to Queen Charlotte.\n\nBack to Homepage\n\nTypos\nNews Tips\nForums\n\nMUST-READ STORIES\n\nGet all the day's most vital news with our newsletter, sent every weekday.\n\n\n\nMore BC News\n\n\n\nBC\nVancouver Webcam\nWebcam provided by windy.com\nRECENT STORIES\nAmbushed in failed hit job\nKamloops - 1:46 pm\nHeat warnings issued\nBC Coast - 1:43 pm\nLife in prison for murder\nAbbotsford - 1:39 pm\nA parade of aches and pains\nCalgary - 1:27 pm\nPower restored in Aberdeen\nKamloops - 1:16 pm\nMore Top Stories >\nBC Quick Links\nBC Discussion Forum\nGovernment of BC\nBC Wildfire Service\nProvincial Emergency Program\nHealthLink BC\nDrive BC\nBC Ferries\n\n\n\n\nBody transformation journeys\nGalleries | July 04, 2024\nVanessa Hudgens gives birth\nShowbiz | July 04, 2024\nBaseball playing pup\nMust Watch | July 04, 2024\nMischievous Beagle caught tearing up the toilet paper\nMust Watch | July 04, 2024\nVintage bathrooms\nGalleries | July 04, 2024\n\n\n\u00a9 2024 Castanet.net Make Castanet Your Homepage News Tips Advertising Contact Us"},

A bus service that links communities along a notorious stretch of highway in northern British Columbia known as the Highway of Tears will carry passengers by the end of the year, the province's transportation minister said Wednesday. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward\nRepublished June 16, 2016 - 5:51 AM\nOriginal Publication Date June 15, 2016 - 2:10 PM\n\nPRINCE GEORGE, B.C. - A bus service that links communities along a notorious stretch of highway in northern British Columbia known as the Highway of Tears will carry passengers by the end of the year, the province's transportation minister said Wednesday.\n\nEighteen women have been murdered or have disappeared along Highway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert and adjacent routes since the 1970s.\n\nFirst Nations, social service agencies and women's groups have been calling for a shuttle bus service in the area for several years to provide regular transportation for people who live in communities along the 750-kilometre route.\n\nThe highway cuts through the centre of the province and follows rivers and mountains, passing through numerous small communities, including Houston, Smithers and Burns Lake. The route also provides the main transportation link to and from remote First Nations villages located off the main highway.\n\nMost cases of murdered and missing women remain unsolved, though investigators don't believe a single killer is responsible.\n\nTransportation Minister Todd Stone says agreements between 16 communities along the highway will allow B.C. Transit to operate a scheduled bus service between Prince George and Prince Rupert.\n\n\"Absolutely, this initiative is all about safety,\" he said.\n\nHe said the communities, the province and B.C. Transit must still develop service schedules and provide extra buses for the route.\n\nStone said plans for the Highway 16 area also include offering bus driver training programs for First Nations to provide transportation service from their remote villages to other major communities along the highway.\n\nChief Corrina Leween of the Cheslatta Carrier Nation said the bus service helps many living in towns on or near the highway, but it offers little comfort to those off the main road.\n\n\"The work they are doing for the core group on the corridor is good, but for us it really doesn't work because we're off the beaten trail,\" she said.\n\nLeween said the main Cheslatta community of about 300 people is located about 25 kilometres south of Burns Lake and getting to the highway requires a ferry trip and travel on a dirt road.\n\nFive Cheslatta people, including a family of four and a male elder, have disappeared from the area over the years, she said.\n\nNew Democrat Maurine Karagianis, the Opposition's critic for women, said area residents and local politicians have called for improved transportation services for years, but the government has been stalling while many people hitchhike for rides with strangers.\n\n\"I say get on with it,\" she said.\n\nFirst Nations advocate Mary Teegee said a decade ago, dozens of people walked from Prince Rupert to Prince George to call for better transportation service along the highway.\n\n\"It has been 10 years since of the Highway of Tears recommendations report came out and we are finally making progress,\" she said in a statement. \"I view transportation as a human rights issue in the north and we are working toward making sure everyone has access.\"\n\n\u2014 By Dirk Meissner in Victoria\n\nNews from \u00a9 The

Bain, My PG Now staff)\n- Advertisement -\n\nA walk is being held in Prince George today (Friday), in recognition of Red Dress Day, the national day of awareness for missing and murdered indigenous women and girls and two-spirit people.\n\nIt begins at 3 pm from the PG RCMP detachment and will conclude at Cottonwood Island Park.\n\nTammy Miese who is the President of the PG Red Dress Society is pleased the city is standing in solidarity with other communities like Ladysmith on Vancouver Island.\n\n\u201cI am very happy that my community, our community of Prince George has always been really wonderful for stepping up and being a part of something bigger than themselves.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cA few years back, the community of Ladysmith put up a red dress display and it was ripped down and defaced. The mayor of Ladysmith then decided that was not OK and reached out to other communities in BC and asked if we would stand in solidarity.\u201d\n\nFor Miese, the topic hits really close to home.\n\n\u201cI lost my childhood best friend Kerryanne Gordon to this horrific issue. She was not murdered along the Highway of Tears but she nevertheless was the victim to violence.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Ottawa endorsed a Red Dress Alert proposal that was tabled by Skeena-Bulkley MP Taylor Bachrach and fellow NDP MP Leah Gazan.\n\nThe alert would be like the current Amber Alert system for abducted children.\u00a0\n\nTheir discussion came after Tuesday\u2019s announcement that the federal government adopted Gazan\u2019s motion to declare ongoing violence against Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people a national emergency.\u00a0\n\nIn addition, BC Assembly of First Nations Regional Chief Terry Teegee remembers and honours those who have been lost to systemic violence and calls for concrete improvements to prevention and response measures to create lasting change.\n\n\u201cIndigenous people are affected by the national crisis of MMIWG2S+ and we all have an important role to play in keeping our families, friends and communities safe. All Canadians and levels of government must also take steps to dismantle and address colonialism, racism, and sexism, which are the underlying causes of the disproportionate violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people. In particular, I\u2019m calling on the governments of BC and Canada to partner with First Nations, families, and advocates to ensure that concrete and meaningful progress is made on each of the immediate and short-term priorities identified in the National Action Plan, and for sustainable and adequate capacity funding for all Indigenous partners so that this work can be advanced in alignment with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,\u201d\n\nSomething going on in the Prince George area you think people should know about?\nSend us a news tip by emailing pgnews@vistaradio.ca.\n\n- Advertisement -\nFacebookTwitterReddItWhatsAppEmail\n- Advertisment -\n- Advertisment -\n- Advertisement -\nContinue Reading\nNews\nNew website looks to protect tenants from bad faith evictions\nNews\nPG Chamber of Commerce critical of City for borrowing money for Aquatic Centre upgrades\nNews\nPG Pride Society preparing for annual pride week, ending with parade\nNews\nWorkSafe urging employers to be conscious as heat wave approaches\nLoad more\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\nIN THE NEWS\n\nNew website looks to protect tenants from bad faith evictions\n \nPG Chamber of Commerce critical of City for borrowing money for Aquatic Centre upgrades\n \nPG Pride Society preparing for annual pride week, ending with parade\n \nWorkSafe urging employers to be conscious as heat wave approaches\n \nSeven week old Cariboo Regional District strike is now over\nCity of Quesnel responds to petition filed against it by Mayor Ron Paull\n \nBC Transit to provide new bus shelters in PG\n \nTimberwolves land Spanish shooting guard\n \nFour Rivers Co-op cardlock locations fully operational after cybersecurity incident\n \nBrendan\u2019s Sports Shorts; Thursday, July 4th\nCanadian Indigenous Music\n \nMornings with Carol\n \nAfternoons With Tim Gavin\n \nPG SAC Voices, With Lynnell and Kendra\nCanadian Indigenous Music\n \nVinyl Power\n \nThe Morning Breath with Robert and Silvio\n \nMiddays With Kurt Flesher\n \nThe Afternoon Drive With Ryan Mitchell\nNews\nWin\nEvents\nContact Us\nContest Rules\nAdvertise\nWe\u2019re Hiring"},

Transit services connecting Prince George to Burns Lake and Smithers on Highway 16 will hit the road this week.\n\nThe services are the latest edition to what proponents hope is a service stretching the entire length of Highway 16 West, from Prince George to Prince Rupert.\n\nEighteen women have been murdered or have disappeared along the stretch \u2014 also known as the Highway of Tears \u2014 and adjacent routes since the 1970s.\n\n\"We are extremely pleased that there are more safe travel options for the north,\" said Carrier Sekani Family Services executive director Mary Teegee in a statement. \"I applaud the work of municipalities, First Nations and government to launch the new transit services. This is a good example of true partnership and effective collaboration.\"\n\nFederal, provincial and local governments have committed $6.4 million over three years to the plan to connect 21 communities along the 750-kilometre stretch.\n\nIt also includes a grant program to help communities north and south of the highway buy shuttle vehicles, a First Nations driver education program \u2014 to boost the number of Class 4 and 5 drivers in those communities \u2014 as well as webcams and bus shelters.\n\nThe first leg, between Smithers and Moricetown, began running on Jan. 30 and B.C. Transit said it is being used daily by many passengers.\n\nTrips between Prince George and Burns Lake will run on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. The run from Burns Lake to Prince George will be in the morning, starting at 7 a.m. at the Wet'suwet'en First Nation just west of the community and cover the 230-kilometre distance in 3 1/2 hours.\n\nThe trip back to Burns Lake starts at 3 p.m. Pickup points in the city are at 7th and Dominion, University Hospital of Northern B.C., Pine Centre and Westgate.\n\nThe routes between Burns Lake and Smithers will operate on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The bus will leave Burns Lake at 6:46 a.m. and arrive in Houston at 8:33 a.m. and Smithers at 9:38 a.m.\n\nThe bus will complete a midday round trip from Smithers to Houston then back to Smithers, starting at 11:30 a.m. It leaves Smithers once again 3 p.m. and goes all the way back to Burns Lake, arriving there at 5:53 p.m.\n\nThe one-way fare will be $5 per segment.\n\nSee a typo/mistake?\nHave a story/tip?\nThis has not been shared.

Each of those buses would cost close to $1 million to purchase, and altogether, they would run for a total of 6,900 hours each year.\n\nUnder the BC Transit funding model, the province is responsible for 46.69 per cent of operating costs and most capital costs for conventional transit, while local governments cover the rest.\n\nThe government documents also include a number of transportation options that wouldn't require expensive heavy-duty highway coaches, including shuttle services provided by 23-seater buses or even smaller vans. These would come with much lower initial costs of $40,000 to $120,000 to purchase each vehicle.\n\nThe ministry was unable to answer if operating costs for those options had been estimated, or to say whether the province is still considering a shuttle bus along the Highway of Tears.\n\nSafe and reliable public transit was one of the immediate priorities pushed by Commissioner Wally Oppal in his November 2012 report on B.C.'s missing women. He wrote that a shuttle bus was particularly important along Highway 16, where 18 girls and women disappeared or were murdered between 1969 and 2006.\n\nBut community and First Nations leaders in the region charge that the province is dragging its feet on that recommendation while they're left with an unreliable patchwork of services that leaves many vulnerable women with no alternative but to hitchhike.\n\nIn fact, when the government released its final report on the Missing Women Inquiry last December, there was no mention of a shuttle bus.\n\nOther possible solutions to the transportation gap outlined in the documents include ride sharing programs, taxi supplements and coupons, or a volunteer transportation network.\n\nThe First Nations Health Authority and B.C. Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure will be hosting a symposium on the issue in Smithers on Nov. 23.\n\nIn the lead up, a survey for First Nations communities along the Highway 16 corridor can be found online at http://bit.ly/fnhatransportationsurvey.\n\nRoughly $4.7 million has been budgeted for Prince George's transit system this year.\n\nThe documents were released in response to an Freedom of Information request from the media that asked for a wide array of reports, studies and communications about the Highway of Tears written by transportation ministry staffers between May and December of 2014.\n\nHowever, it's possible the documents are incomplete. A former ministry employee has alleged he was ordered last year to delete emails and documents related to government consultation with local communities about safety along Highway 16 after receiving an FOI request from the NDP.\n\nB.C. Information and Privacy Commissioner Elizabeth Denham released her investigation report on the alleged destruction on Thursday and forwarded her findings to the RCMP for a possible criminal investigation.\n\n- with files from Mark Nielsen, Prince George Citizen\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nReport a mistake\nThis has been shared 0 times\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nMore Local News\n\tWater main break forces closure of Prince George street\n\tNew bus shelters coming to Prince George\n\tFoodie Fridays back for the summer in downtown Prince George\nPrince George - Featured\nBC's forest cutting permit process handcuffing industry, says Lheidli T'enneh, Simpcw chiefs\nRead More\nCOMMUNITY POLL\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nDo you watch or listen to CBC News once a week or more?\n Often\n Never\n Rarely\n Sometimes\n Always\n\nVOTE RESULTS > ARCHIVES >\n\nTRENDING TODAY\n1\t\nCarrier Lumber president backs First Nations' plea to restore local forest policy decision-making\n\n2\t\nRCMP search for witnesses and footage from June 29 fatal accident\n\n3\t\nRCMP provides update on wanted persons that have now been located\n\n4\t\nRCMP: 16-year-old youth who overdosed last week has died\n\n5\t\nDeciduous Heroes visit Prince George with a message: Forests are at risk\nNews\nHighlights\nLocal News\nLocal Sports\nBritish Columbia\nCanada\nWorld\nAnimal Stories\nOpinion\nOpinion\nSend us a letter\nArts & Life\nLocal Arts\nPhotos and Videos\nFeatures\nGas Prices\nSpecial Features\nWeather\nDigital Edition\nDigital Archive\nSponsored Content\nObituaries\nConnect\nContact Us\nAdvertise with Us\nDaily Headlines Email\nSupport Local News\nCitizen Box Locations\nLocal Events\nAbout\nAdvertising\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Service\nPolitical Ads Registry\nSpecial Features\nDigital Archive\nReaders Choice\n\n\u00a9 2024 Prince George Citizen"},

The infamous 750-kilometre span of road meanders through an isolated region of B.C.'s Interior, between Prince Rupert and Prince George.\n\nStone's announcement comes shortly after the federal government went public with plans to launch a national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women. Many who have called for the inquiry have highlighted the tragic history of the Highway of Tears.\n\nAn RCMP report stated last year nearly 1,200 aboriginal women were murdered or went missing across Canada between 1980 and 2012.\n\nMonday's announcement in B.C. committed $1.6 million over two years on a cost-sharing basis with communities to extend pre-existing transit along Highway 16.\n\nAn additional $750,000 over three years will go towards helping communities buy and operate transit vehicles, as well as $150,000 over three years to increase the number of licensed drivers in First Nations communities.\n\nThe province earmarked a final $500,000 in infrastructure funding over two years to install more transit shelters and highway webcams.\n\n\"In addition to enhancing the actual transportation options that people have in the corridor, we want people to also know that we have an eye on safety as well,\" said Stone.\n\nOverseeing the program's implementation is an advisory panel, made up of representatives from the province, local governments, health authorities and First Nations.\n\nBurns Lake Mayor Luke Strimbold, who is part of the advisory group, said the $3-million funding announcement marks historic progress in improving safety along Highway 16.\n\n\"Our communities now have a framework we can work towards to implement transportation solutions,\" said Strimbold.\n\nFirst Nations Health Authority spokesman Richard Jock is also on the board and shared Strimbold's optimism. He emphasized the opportunity to improve access to health care for people living in remote communities.\n\n\"We're looking forward to working in particular with our northern health partners to see how this can really be part of effective transportation response in the North,\" he said.\n\nSmithers Mayor Taylor Bachrach spoke positively about the government's plan, but at the same time raised concerns.\n\n\"The key question is whether the amount of resources that are being put on the table are going to be adequate to fix the problem,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not sure that $1.6 million over two years is going to provide affordable, accessible transportation for all of the small communities in our region. The problem is somewhat larger.\"\n\nNew Democrat member of the legislature and northern health critic Jennifer Rice questioned if the plan's cost-sharing approach would be financially feasible for all northern communities.\n\n\"Families of murdered and missing women have been waiting for some action for well over a decade,\" she said.\n\n\"But having some money put towards improving transportation in the North is positive.\"\n\nStone said the government will have a better idea about how the funding will be distributed after the advisory panel meets with local groups and reports back to him by early March.\n\n\u2014 By Geordon Omand in Vancouver\n\n\u2014 Follow @gwomand on Twitter\n\nNews from \u00a9 The Canadian Press, 2015\n\n\nMore News ...\niN RESPONSE: Readers have their say\nFollowing are emailed reader responses to stories or letters to...\nChefs mourn for Okanagan's peaches but adapt to stone fruit wipeout\nKelowna woman loses legal fight with housing co-op over medical cannabis\nFrom no strata fees to discounted golf, Okanagan developers using promos to sell homes\nPopular Kamloops News\nOkanagan contractors fined $19,000 for unsafe building sites\nJuly 02, 2024 6:00 PM\nKamloops homeless day services set to close with no promised replacement\nJuly 03, 2024 6:00 AM\nKelowna breeder wins after being sued over sick Labradoodle\nJuly 03, 2024 7:00 AM\nVernon cabinetmaker ordered to pay $2,500 for shoddy work\nJuly 01, 2024 6:00 AM\n'Merchants of death': Lengthy sentence for Vernon fentanyl dealer\nJuly 01, 2024 6:00 PM\nTop News\nKamloops police investigating targeted gangland shooting\niNwheels\nJuly 04, 2024 1:05 PM\nNo more lengthy delays in Highway 97 rock slide zone near Summerland\niNwheels\nJuly 04, 2024 11:55 AM\nHow to stay cool at work during southern Interior heat wave\nJuly 04, 2024 10:50 AM\nChefs mourn for Okanagan's peaches but adapt to stone fruit wipeout\niNwine\nJuly 04, 2024 9:41 AM\nMan broke into Kelowna construction site, climbed crane\nJuly 04, 2024 7:37 AM\nTrending Now\nTRENDING NOW: Stormtrooper party balloon chaos\nKamloops\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nKamloops Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nKelowna\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nKelowna Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nPenticton\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nPenticton Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nVernon\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nVernon Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\n\u00a9 2024 InfoTel News Ltd\nContact iNFOTEL MULTIMEDIA |\u00a0\nContact iNFOnews |\u00a0\nSubmit News Tips |\u00a0\nPrivacy Policy & Disclaimer |\u00a0\nSitemap |\u00a0\nNewsletter Signup\nView Site in: Desktop | Mobile"},

(Flickr)\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Highway of Tears is a 725-km. stretch of road that connects Prince George and Prince Rupert in central BC. Officially known as Highway 16, the name \u2018Highway of Tears\u2019 was coined by Florence Naziel during a vigil held in 1998 to commemorate the women, many of them Indigenous, who had gone missing along the route.\u00a0\n\nNaziel had observed the families of those missing crying over the disappearance of their loved ones, and their tears were strongly connected to Hwy 16.\u00a0\n\nFor more than 50 years, the route through rural BC has been the site of numerous abductions and murders.\u00a0\n\nAn RCMP task force, E-Pana, was created in 2005 with the purpose of solving cases of those missing and murdered along Hwy 16. Within a year, the scope of the investigations expanded to include Highways 5, 24 and 97.\u00a0\n\nBetween 1970 and today, the E-Pana list recognizes fewer than 18 victims. However, according to Aboriginal organizations, the number of missing and murdered women could exceed 40, beginning earlier than 1970. Taking into account all potential cases on all routes, the number of victims could be more than 80, beginning with the unsolved murder of 26-year-old Gloria Levine Moody near Williams Lake in 1969.\u00a0\n\nThere has been much speculation over the years as to whether the murders are the work of several perpetrators, sadistic opportunists, or whether a serial killer may be operating in the region. \u00a0\n\nA billboard erected along the route reads: \u201cGirls don\u2019t Hitchhike on the Highway of Tears. Killer on the loose!\u201d\u00a0\n\nMany of the victims were known to frequently hitchhike, or went missing while hitchhiking along the highway, due mainly to poverty, lack of car ownership or access to reliable transit. In order to leave situations of domestic violence, visit friends and family, travel for work or school or to attend medical appointments, many women have no alternative, despite the dangers.\u00a0\n\nRCMP believe there are several factors which have lead to this area becoming a hotspot for criminal activity, including the remoteness of the area, reducing the likelihood of being interrupted while committing a crime such as sexual assault or murder, soft soil in which to dispose of evidence, and the prevalence of carnivorous scavengers such as birds, wolves, bears, and coyotes.\u00a0\n\nOn June 16, 2006 the Highway of Tears Symposium Recommendation Report was issued, a 35-page report which made 33 recommendations intended to be a call to action for Victim Prevention, Emergency Planning and Team Response, Victim Family Counselling and Support and Community Development and Support.\u00a0\n\nRecommendation #8 included a request for increased cell service along the route.\u00a0\n\n\u201cTelus Mobility should be approached to look into the feasibility of increasing cell phone coverage along the entire length of the highway thus minimizing or eliminating no signal areas.\u201d\n\nOver the last decade, TELUS has provided 70% of Highway 16 between Prince Rupert and Prince George with a reliable wireless signal, connecting more than 500 kilometres of Highway 16 to new wireless service, giving residents and visitors the ability to make phone calls from the highway, and enhancing safety by providing fast access to 911 in the event of an emergency.\n\nNow, 15 years later, this recommendation is being put into full practice as the entire route from Prince George to Prince Rupert will have complete cellular coverage, thanks to both federal and provincial investments.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe must continue to do everything in our power to prevent violence against Indigenous women and girls to ensure they are safe to travel anywhere in our province, but especially between communities along Highway 16,\u201d said Barb Ward-Burkitt, executive director, Prince George Native Friendship Centre.\u00a0\n\n\u201c\u2026it serves as an important step\u00a0of reconciliation and honouring for murdered and missing sisters, daughters, mothers, aunties and their families.\u201d\n\nBy implementing this recommendation, it is hoped that those women or girls who find themselves in a dangerous situation along the highway will be able to call for help, thus potentially reducing the number of victims.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis project will provide continuous cellular coverage along the whole of the highway corridor, which will improve overall safety for this area,\u201d said Murray Rankin, B.C.\u2019s Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt honours the memory of both survivors and the friends and family members of the Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people who have gone missing, been murdered or experienced other forms of violence along Highway 16.\u201d\n\nRogers will install twelve cellular towers, providing 252 km of new highway cellular coverage, eliminating several \u2018dead zones\u2019 where no service currently exists.\u00a0\n\nThe project is scheduled to be completed in the fall of 2022.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSHARE:\n\n \nPREVIOUS\nNVIT to erect permanent Red Dress exhibit\nNEXT\nLogan Lake RCMP arrest auto theft suspect after breakdown on highway\nRELATED POSTS\nNDP moves to limit local election money\n\nOctober 31, 2017\n\nPolice Report: RCMP break up house party, respond to theft\n\nSeptember 4, 2012\n\nIHA monitoring glue spill cleanup\n\nNovember 19, 2015\n\nSANTA\u2019S HELPERS\n\nNovember 28, 2011\n\nNEWSLETTER\n\nFirst Name \n\nLast Name \n\nEmail address: \n\nCLASSIFIEDS\nMedical Office Assistant Position June 19, 2024\nSales Person/Office Admin May 15, 2024\nNVCL April 4, 2024\nRECENT OBITUARIES\nAlan Norman Clarence Taylor June 19, 2024\nFay Sturney June 19, 2024\nBeverly Jean Malchuk June 19, 2024\nSister Newspapers\nBowen Island Undercurrent\nBurnaby Now\nBusiness in Vancouver\nCastanet\nCoast Reporter\nDelta Optimist\nLethbridge Herald\nMedicine Hat News\nMoose Jaw Today\nNew West Record\nNorth Shore News\nPique Newsmagazine\nPowell River Peak\nPrince George Citizen\nREW.ca\nRichmond News\nSaskToday.ca\nSquamish Chief\nThe Orca\nTimes Colonist\nTriCity News\nVancouver is Awesome\nWestern Investor\nAirdrie Today\nAlberta Prime Times\nCochrane Today\nLakeland Today\nMountain View Today\nOkotoks Today\nRocky Mountain Outlook\nSt. Albert Gazette\nTown and Country Today\nOther Sections\nAbout Us\n\nAdvertise\n\nReal Estate\n\nClassifieds\n\nEvents\n\nMagazines\n\nSubscribe\n\nContact Us\n\nConnect\n\nMerritt Herald\n#201- 1951 Garcia Street,\nMerritt, BC V1K 1B8\n\nPhone\n1-250-378-4241\n\nAberdeen Publishing \u00a9 Copyright \u00ae\u00a02020.\u00a0\u00a0All rights reserved.

Monday, Oct. 8, 2012. (Jonathan Hayward / THE CANADIAN PRESS)\n\nSHARE:\nReddit\n\n\n\n\nVICTORIA -- Enhanced transit routes, expanded driver-training programs and more roadside webcams make up the core of a multimillion-dollar plan aimed at improving safety along a stretch of British Columbia highway renowned for missing and murdered women.\n\nB.C.'s Transport Minister Todd Stone announced a long-awaited $3-million strategy for the so-called Highway of Tears on Monday, saying delays in government action were the result of extensive consultation with local stakeholders.\n\n\"I would have liked to have been making this announcement many, many, many months ago, but we needed to go through this rigorous process of engagement and discussion,\" said Stone. \"Today is about transitioning from the discussion to action.\"\n\nRelated Stories\nFirst Nations groups push for safety along Highway of Tears\nRCMP warned budget cuts would hamper Highway of Tears probe\n\nEighteen women, many of them aboriginal, have disappeared or been murdered along Highway 16 or adjacent routes since the 1970s. The infamous 750-kilometre span of road meanders through an isolated region of B.C.'s Interior, between Prince Rupert and Prince George.\n\nStone's announcement comes shortly after the federal government went public with plans to launch a national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women. Many who have called for the inquiry have highlighted the tragic history of the Highway of Tears.\n\nAn RCMP report stated last year nearly 1,200 aboriginal women were murdered or went missing across Canada between 1980 and 2012.\n\nMonday's announcement in B.C. committed $1.6 million over two years on a cost-sharing basis with communities to extend pre-existing transit along Highway 16.\n\nAn additional $750,000 over three years will go towards helping communities buy and operate transit vehicles, as well as $150,000 over three years to increase the number of licensed drivers in First Nations communities.\n\nThe province earmarked a final $500,000 in infrastructure funding over two years to install more transit shelters and highway webcams.\n\n\"In addition to enhancing the actual transportation options that people have in the corridor, we want people to also know that we have an eye on safety as well,\" said Stone.\n\nOverseeing the program's implementation is an advisory panel, made up of representatives from the province, local governments, health authorities and First Nations.\n\nBurns Lake Mayor Luke Strimbold, who is part of the advisory group, said the $3-million funding announcement marks historic progress in improving safety along Highway 16.\n\n\"Our communities now have a framework we can work towards to implement transportation solutions,\" said Strimbold.\n\nFirst Nations Health Authority spokesman Richard Jock is also on the board and shared Strimbold's optimism. He emphasized the opportunity to improve access to health care for people living in remote communities.\n\n\"We're looking forward to working in particular with our northern health partners to see how this can really be part of effective transportation response in the North,\" he said.\n\nSmithers Mayor Taylor Bachrach spoke positively about the government's plan, but at the same time raised concerns.\n\n\"The key question is whether the amount of resources that are being put on the table are going to be adequate to fix the problem,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not sure that $1.6 million over two years is going to provide affordable, accessible transportation for all of the small communities in our region. The problem is somewhat larger.\"\n\nNew Democrat member of the legislature and northern health critic Jennifer Rice questioned if the plan's cost-sharing approach would be financially feasible for all northern communities.\n\n\"Families of murdered and missing women have been waiting for some action for well over a decade,\" she said.\n\n\"But having some money put towards improving transportation in the North is positive.\"\n\nStone said the government will have a better idea about how the funding will be distributed after the advisory panel meets with local groups and reports back to him by early March.\n\nSHARE:\nReddit\nReport Error\nEditorial standards and\u00a0policies\nWhy you can trust CTV\u00a0News\nDON'T MISS\nfalse\nPet chicken from B.C. is now a Guinness World Record holder\nfalse\nOnt. woman says black widow spider was inside bag of grapes\nfalse\nThis Calgary man is trying to climb 21 mountains in 21 days\nVANCOUVER TOP STORIES\nAbbotsford man who killed his wife sentenced for second-degree murder\nIncoming heat may trigger warnings in Metro Vancouver, Fraser Valley: ECCC\nCluster of earthquakes off B.C. coast 'business as usual,' seismologist says\n'Like urban warfare': Community-led police oversight project launched in Vancouver\nPolice ask for help identifying man who allegedly filmed woman in Surrey bathroom stall\nB.C.

On Thursday, Radek will honour the 12th anniversary of the disappearance of her niece, Tamara Lynn Chipman, by walking the route once again.\n\n\u201cYou can feel the pain of the families when they\u2019re walking with you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really hard to describe.\u201d\n\nThe annual journey, made by Radek and others who have lost loved ones, will span five days this year and cover 350 kilometres between Prince Rupert and Smithers. Vehicles will accompany the walkers who will cover sections of the route in a relay fashion.\n\nCommissioners of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls are set to join the walk on Sept. 25 before community hearings are held from Sept. 26 to 28 in Smithers. This is the second set of hearings held to date by the inquiry, after it visited Whitehorse in May.\n\nSince then, the inquiry\u2019s executive director, Michele Moreau, and one of its commissioners, Marilyn Poitras, have quit and the Native Women\u2019s Association of Ontario has pulled its support. The inquiry has faced growing calls for resignations and a restart.\n\nAsked whether commissioners feel added pressure to ensure these hearings are successful, Chief Commissioner Marion Buller said they feel that obligation regardless.\n\n\u201cThey have to be (successful), not only for our purposes, but more so for the families who come forward and share their stories with us. It\u2019s the success from their perspective that\u2019s the most important aspect for us,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always under scrutiny. Always. And we always will be,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m always open to constructive, informed criticism, as are the other commissioners. It\u2019s part of our work.\u201d\n\nThe federal government launched the inquiry last year to examine the systemic issues behind the high number of Indigenous women who have been killed or disappeared over the last four decades in Canada. It is expected to take two years and cost almost $54 million.\n\nREAD MORE: Highway of Tears bus starts rolling on 30-minute trips on Hwy. 16\n\nVIDEO: Take back the highway\n\nBuller said the commission will ask for more money and time but it is still conducting an internal analysis before making the request.\n\nAbout 25 people, including family members and survivors of violence, are expected to testify publicly or privately at the Dze L K\u2019Ant Friendship Centre next week. A statement-taker will be available for anyone who wishes to speak, with no pre-registration needed, said Buller.\n\nRadek will testify about Chipman, who disappeared while hitchhiking in Prince Rupert on Sept. 21, 2005. The 22-year-old was a beautiful, charming free spirit who had a young son, she recalled.\n\nCritics of the inquiry don\u2019t understand how much ground it has to cover, said Radek, who sits on its national family advisory circle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as two years of work. These people, these commissioners and the staff that they have working right now, they are uncovering the stones that should have been turned a long time ago,\u201d she said.\n\nPeople living along the Highway of Tears had to wait years for the provincial government to carry out a key recommendation of the B.C. inquiry into missing and murdered women, said Terry Tegee, tribal chief of the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council.\n\nThe recommendation \u2014 reliable public transit along the route \u2014 was finally implemented earlier this year. But the experience has led Teegee to call for the federal inquiry to have more teeth. Like the missing inquiry in B.C., the recommendations from the national inquiry will be non-binding.\n\nTeegee also said he\u2019s concerned that people in small communities that still lack transit won\u2019t be able to participate in the Smithers hearings.\n\nBuller said staff have visited nearby towns in recent weeks to reach out to families and it is able to help cover travel costs including mileage and meals, she said.\n\nThe hearings will be the first of nine this fall, with other stops in Winnipeg, Halifax, Edmonton, Yellowknife, Saskatoon, Sask., Maliotenam, Que., Thunder Bay, Ont., and Rankin Inlet, Nunavut.\n\nLaura Kane, The Canadian Press\n\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tRobots, technology take care in Comox's innovative new dementia village\n\t\tComox Valley Ducky 500 winners announced\n\t\tCVRD, Clean BC to offer heat pump and electrical upgrade rebates\n\t\tComox Valley RCMP investigating fatal overnight collision involving pedestrian\n\t\t'You shattered her life': 3 years for sexual assault of young Kelowna woman\nFacebook Comments (0) \nComox Valley RCMP investigating fatal overnight collision involving pedestrian\nBlack Press Media\nDriver airlifted to hospital after Vancouver Island crash\nBlack Press Media\nStudent Discovers Genius Device to Wipe Out Mosquitoes Instantly\nTop Review Picks\n|\nSponsored\nReview: Captain Cooks Casino is the Real Deal\nTrust Pilot Rating and Review: I did what any savvy person would do.

Families and friends will share stories off loss with five commissioners who will hear from Indigenous people across the country. The commissioners will look for the patterns and underlying factors behind so much violence against Indigenous women and girls in Canada.\n\nGladys Radek has been walking epic distances ever since her niece disappeared on Highway 16 east of Prince Rupert.\n\nSept. 21 marks the 12 year anniversary of when Tamara Lynn Chipman went missing, last seen hitchhiking on the highway across from the industrial park entrance. At 8 a.m., from the same location, Radek and more than 20 other families and friends joined her in a walk that will end in Smithers for the National Inquiry of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\n\n\u201cThis walk is for the family. For my family, for Tamara and for the missing and murdered women across Canada. I\u2019ve discovered there\u2019s thousands of other Tamaras out there,\u201d Radek said.\n\nHighway 16, from Prince Rupert to Prince George, is known as the Highway of Tears for more than 19 women, and men, who have been murdered or gone missing over the years. Tamara was 22 years old and a mother to her two-year-old son when she disappeared.\n\nShe won\u2019t be walking the 150 kilometre distance alone. Family members from the northern area will be joining her, as well as elders and activists coming from Vancouver and some of the original walkers who have been with her since the beginning.\n\nTamara\u2019s father, Tom and her now teenage son, also participated in part of the walk. The night before their departure, Tom, family and friends placed a \u201cmemory stone\u201d on the side of the hill next to where Tamara was last seen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty emotional. It\u2019s been 12 years. Every time we do one of these walks it brings back memories again of course. It\u2019s kind of hard to deal with in a way but it does make you feel a little bit better seeing all the people and all the support that we\u2019re getting from family and friends and a lot of people came as far as Vancouver,\u201d Tom said, who will be at the inquiry in Smithers.\n\nIn 2006, Radek\u2019s cousin organized a walk from Prince Rupert to Prince George, which set the template for her walks across the country. She has co-organized walks through the organizations Walk4Justice and Tears4Justice, including a national trek from Vancouver to Ottawa, Vancouver to Prince Rupert, Kamloops to Winnipeg and Nova Scotia to Prince Rupert in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt brings a little bit of healing and it brings other family members together and helps us to walk and feel the spirits of the women. It gives us hope and it makes our family realize we are truly not alone,\u201d Radek said.\n\nArnie Sankey is one of the volunteers from Prince Rupert who has been supporting Radek\u2019s efforts in previous walks, and this year\u2019s walk. He helped coordinate a send off feast Wednesday night at the Nisga\u2019a Hall.\n\n\u201cTamara went missing 12 years ago, which happens to be my birthday. I drive by to and from there every day \u2014 the last place she was seen, across industrial park. It hit home so I started volunteering then,\u201d Sankey said.\n\nBefore the group started walking down the highway, they sang happy birthday to Sankey, thanking him for all his volunteer efforts.\n\nVolunteers in vehicles will support the walkers, who expected to reach their final destination in Smithers in time for the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls community hearings on Sept. 26-28.\n\nA memorial stone was placed next to where Tamara Lynn Chapman was last seen next to the industrial park entrance along Highway 16 east of Prince Rupert.

Gazan is requesting the federal government establish a system where the public receives a phone notification when Indigenous women go missing. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick\nListen to this article\n00:01:14\n\nOttawa should establish a system that would send the public a phone notification when an Indigenous woman goes missing to ensure that their disappearances stop being \"normalized,\" says an NDP member of Parliament.\u00a0\n\nLeah Gazan penned a letter to Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino on Friday urging the government to fund what she and other advocates call a \"Red Dress Alert\" program. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u00a0\n\nGazan says that while details of the program would have to be negotiated, she imagines it would operate similarly to the Amber Alert, which is an emergency notification people receive on their phones when a child in their region has been abducted or is believed to be in danger.\u00a0\n\n\"We shouldn't have to beg for our safety,\" Gazan said in an interview Wednesday. \"In Canada, we are still begging for safety and to live in dignity as Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people.\"\u00a0\n\nResearch from across the country, including the 2019 final report from the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls, shows that Indigenous people, and women in particular, disappear at a higher rate than people who are not Indigenous.\n\nGazan said that for years, advocates and the families of missing and murdered women and girls have said there needs to be a faster response by police and other authorities in their cases.\u00a0\n\nAnd because Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has recognized the crisis in missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls as a genocide, he must act urgently to better protect them, Gazan said.\n\nIt's \"almost as if our disappearances (have) become so normalized that nobody looks for us,\" she added.Setting up a specialized alert system, she said, \"acknowledges the urgency.\"\n\nThe Winnipeg MP said that if the public is better informed when Indigenous women and girls disappear, it will increase the likelihood that they are found.\n\n\"We know that the sooner cases start, the sooner searches start when somebody goes missing, the more likely they are to be found,\" she said, pointing to the success of emergency notification programs for children.\u00a0\n\nCalls to set up a \"Red Dress Alert\" in Canada are not new, and some advocates have established grassroots-led efforts on their own, such as the Aboriginal Alert website, which publishes timely information and photos of Indigenous people who are missing.\u00a0\n\nLast year, Washington state established the \"Missing Indigenous Person Alert System,\" adding it to an existing alert system in place to broadcast the disappearances of children and seniors.\u00a0\n\nWhile its state patrol says that not every Indigenous person who is missing will qualify for the program, those that do are individuals who go missing under unexplained or suspicious circumstances and appear to be vulnerable due to reasons such as age and health.\u00a0\n\nIn her letter sent last week, Gazan pointed to the disappearances and deaths of at least four First Nations women who Winnipeg police believe were murdered by the same man.\u00a0\n\nJeremy Skibicki has been charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Morgan Harris, Marcedes Myran, Rebecca Contois and an unidentified woman whom local Indigenous leaders have been referring to as Mashkode

She was 16, about to start a summer job as a peer counselor. For decades her mother, Matilda, would remember the night her \u201cbright, bubbly\u201d daughter went out the door. Ramona was headed to a dance, then staying the night at her best friend\u2019s. She never arrived at the dance.\n\nSo begins Highway of Tears: A True Story of Racism, Indifference, and the Pursuit of Justice for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls ($28, Atria), Jessica McDiarmid\u2019s chronicle of those who vanished or were found murdered along a remote stretch of Canada\u2019s Highway 16 between Prince George, in eastern British Columbia, and the coastal town of Prince Rupert. The first known case near the highway was in 1989. Three decades later, that number has grown to more than a dozen, and that\u2019s just a microcosm of the rest of the country. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) conservatively puts the number of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls across Canada at nearly 1,200. Yet the crimes didn\u2019t draw international attention until a scathing Amnesty International report in 2004. A couple of years later, a national multiagency task force was created to investigate the cases (many of them bungled or unsolved), and finally, in 2015, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau launched\u00a0a national inquiry, which just concluded this summer. But it took the courageous efforts of a community of women\u2014the victims\u2019 mothers, aunties, sisters, cousins, grandmothers, and friends\u2014to make people care.\n\nSimilar Reads\n\u201cCocaine and Surfing\u201d Is the Funniest Surfing Book Ever\nThe Mountain Biker Who Vanished Without a Trace\nThe Most Gruesome National Parks Book Series\nOur Favorite Books and Movies About Mount Everest\n\nMcDiarmid is a Canadian journalist and well suited to tell this complicated narrative. She grew up in Smithers and recalls being ten years old and seeing posters of Ramona blanketing the town. She later discovered that Ramona was among several indigenous girls to go missing around that time. Some, like Roxanne Thiara and Alishia Germaine, turned up dead. In the extensively reported book, McDiarmid jumps between their stories and those of several other girls and women, the region\u2019s history, the investigations, the media\u2019s role, the activism of the victims\u2019 families trying to wrest justice, and the landscape framing Highway 16.\n\nShe knows the terrain well: One moment her descriptions of the isolated 450-mile road are vividly beautiful, with their dark green forests, snowcapped peaks, and glacial valleys. The next they convey a preternatural menace. \u201cThe air grows heavier as the highway draws closer to the Pacific,\u201d she writes, \u201cclinging to a ledge above the Skeena River blasted from the mountainsides to make way for trains and trucks, where the margin of error is only a few feet in either direction.\u201d\n\nSometimes the book\u2019s structure hampers the narrative, and her thoroughness makes it tough to absorb everything. But she fills in an important, overlooked era in Canada\u2019s history, putting a critical lens on the forces that have led to indigenous girls and women being targeted. McDiarmid traces the legacy of colonialism in British Columbia, how it stripped indigenous nations of their land and their livelihood, effectively dooming many to poverty. She also shows how the horrific abuse that children suffered at \u201cresidential schools\u201d\u2014boarding schools designed to eliminate Native students\u2019 language and identity in the name of assimilation\u2014decimated First Nations families. For instance, Ramona\u2019s mother, Matilda, was taken away from her parents at age five and dispatched by train to a residential school called Lejac, where she \u201cwas assigned a number in place of her birth name. They were at Lejac to learn the white man\u2019s ways, to have the \u2018savage\u2019 within them extinguished.\u201d\n\nMcDiarmid also details how racism and trauma still haunt the present, and she connects them to the girls\u2019 struggles. Some of them skip school to hang out on the rough streets of Smithers with friends. Others have been put in juvenile-detention facilities for minor crimes, like Delphine, a 15-year-old whose dad died and whose mother lies ill in a hospital hours away from home. Delphine is jailed for theft, mischief, and breaking and entering. Because there\u2019s no public transportation along Highway 16, most of the teens hitchhike to get around. Others, like Roxanne, who is also 15, bounce around homeless and are sexually exploited in Prince George, a cesspool of drugs and crime. So when the girls go missing, the response is often judgmental. \u201cIt was not unusual in the 1990s to hear comments about the \u2018error\u2019 a girl must have committed to encounter such a fate, whether it was hitchhiking, prostitution, drinking, or walking alone at night,\u201d McDiarmid writes.\n\nWhat is most notable about these families, though, is their strength and their ferocious love.\n\nThe vast distances between towns on the highway have another tragic effect. When 19-year-old Lana Derrick doesn\u2019t come home, her family assumes she spent the night with friends in Terrace, hours away. But when she fails to show up for her college classes, they know something is wrong. That delay was critical as they searched for her\u2014they lost three days. Such delays are compounded by varying police response to the crimes. For the most part, it\u2019s infuriating and familiar: the indifference, the incompetence, a lack of resources and experience, a lack of transparency. Files get misplaced, evidence gets tossed. It\u2019s refreshing when we meet a few investigators who are good guys, devoted to finding the girls and their killers. But there\u2019s also pervasive racism and a history of bad relations between the RCMP and many First Nations communities. In the case of Lana, McDiarmid tells us, \u201cInitially, the family felt the RCMP brushed them off, suggesting she was probably out on a bender or shacked up with a boyfriend for a few days. Her family knew that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\n\nThe girls\u2019 families do trust McDiarmid, though, and that serves an essential purpose. It allows readers to know the impact of these devastating crimes. Years later, the families whose daughters, sisters, and nieces have never been found continue to suffer. These, I thought, were some of most affecting moments in the book. I cried when I read that one despondent mother, after years of searching for her daughter and trying to compel public attention for her case, slowly drank herself to death. Their guilt is heartbreaking. As McDiarmid writes about a man named Francis, whose sister, Alberta, was murdered, \u201cIt was a closed-casket funeral. It had to be. Francis always wondered what might have happened if he had gone to Bogey\u2019s [a club] that night when Alberta asked him to come. He was her big brother; if he had been there, he could have protected her.\u201d\n\nWhat is most notable about these families, though, is their strength and their ferocious love. Despite their grief and the lack of any support, the mothers refuse to give up on their daughters who have been murdered or remain missing. They march along the highway, demanding action and igniting an entire movement and a national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. They are still fighting.\n\nCorrections: (07/04/2024) The original version of this story misidentified Justin Trudeau as the president of Canada. The story has been updated to reflect he is Canada's prime minister.

Countless Indigenous women and girls have either gone missing or been murdered, but all have one link: this stretch of highway from Prince Rupert to Prince George.\u00c2\u00a0The topography in this area is especially suited for concealment; it is a neverending network of logging roads, ravines and rivers. However, as host Lisa Meeches points out, \u201cthese crimes of opportunity are about more than location. They reveal dark underlying truths about society.\u201d\n\nTonight, Taken focuses on two separate cases from the Highway of Tears: Ramona Wilson and Alberta Williams. Both led happy lives surrounded by family and friends. Their murders devastated their families and in each case, remain unsolved.\n\nAlberta Williams, 24, had been at\u00c2\u00a0a local pub on August 15, 1989, with family and friends, celebrating a last night with visiting friends. It\u00c2\u00a0was the last time she\u00c2\u00a0was seen alive; her body was found a little over month later\u00c2\u00a0near the Tyee overpass. She had been strangled and sexually assaulted. In addition to the officers working the case, Alberta\u2019s sister enlisted the aid of private investigator, former RCMP officer Ray Michalko to try and find her sister\u2019s killer\n\nRamona Wilson, meanwhile, was a well-loved child, active in sports and would often lose herself while composing poetry. On the\u00c2\u00a0 evening of June 11, 1994, at the age of 16, Ramona left home to go to a dance with her friends in a neighbouring town. She never arrived. It was not until April 10, 1995\u00e2\u20ac\u201dalmost a year later\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthat Ramona\u2019s remains were found with her clothing neatly placed nearby. RCMP staff sergeant\u00c2\u00a0 Wayne Clary still believes Ramona\u2019s case is very solvable. Many suspects have been eliminated but to date it\u00c2\u00a0remains unsolved.\n\nThese two cases highlight a social issue many communities face today: a lack of affordable transportation. How do you get from an isolated community to a neighbouring urban centre? Chief Terry Teegee of Carrier Segani Tribal Council\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand cousin of Ramona\u00e2\u20ac\u201dreminds us this complicates lives for many. Appointments may be missed, steady employment is difficult, it is hard\u00c2\u00a0to attend school, or to even get an adequate education. Due to the remoteness of northern communities, there are fewer opportunities for economic development. This results in a lack of affordable transportation, so many community members resort to hitchhiking despite the danger.\n\nCraig Benjamin of Amnesty International Canada explains further: \u201cThe very fact that we are looking at rates of violence seven or eight times higher than all other women and girls in Canada means that this violence does not come from a single source but is pervasive \u2026 the very fact that this violence could go on year after year tells us that there is something fundamentally wrong here.\u201d\n\nOnce again, I need to repeat, this program is not designed to entertain us, but rather is about sharing information. I do like the way each case has been chosen to highlight larger systemic problems. Many Indigenous communities face these issues that are a direct result of colonizing policy and practices still prevalent in Canada today. I am also very pleased APTN airs each episode twice in each time zone.

Gazan is requesting the federal government establish a system where the public receives a phone notification when Indigenous women go missing. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick\nListen to this article\n00:01:14\n\nOttawa should establish a system that would send the public a phone notification when an Indigenous woman goes missing to ensure that their disappearances stop being \"normalized,\" says an NDP member of Parliament.\u00a0\n\nLeah Gazan penned a letter to Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino on Friday urging the government to fund what she and other advocates call a \"Red Dress Alert\" program. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u00a0\n\nGazan says that while details of the program would have to be negotiated, she imagines it would operate similarly to the Amber Alert, which is an emergency notification people receive on their phones when a child in their region has been abducted or is believed to be in danger.\u00a0\n\n\"We shouldn't have to beg for our safety,\" Gazan said in an interview Wednesday. \"In Canada, we are still begging for safety and to live in dignity as Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people.\"\u00a0\n\nResearch from across the country, including the 2019 final report from the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls, shows that Indigenous people, and women in particular, disappear at a higher rate than people who are not Indigenous.\n\nGazan said that for years, advocates and the families of missing and murdered women and girls have said there needs to be a faster response by police and other authorities in their cases.\u00a0\n\nAnd because Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has recognized the crisis in missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls as a genocide, he must act urgently to better protect them, Gazan said.\n\nIt's \"almost as if our disappearances (have) become so normalized that nobody looks for us,\" she added.Setting up a specialized alert system, she said, \"acknowledges the urgency.\"\n\nThe Winnipeg MP said that if the public is better informed when Indigenous women and girls disappear, it will increase the likelihood that they are found.\n\n\"We know that the sooner cases start, the sooner searches start when somebody goes missing, the more likely they are to be found,\" she said, pointing to the success of emergency notification programs for children.\u00a0\n\nCalls to set up a \"Red Dress Alert\" in Canada are not new, and some advocates have established grassroots-led efforts on their own, such as the Aboriginal Alert website, which publishes timely information and photos of Indigenous people who are missing.\u00a0\n\nLast year, Washington state established the \"Missing Indigenous Person Alert System,\" adding it to an existing alert system in place to broadcast the disappearances of children and seniors.\u00a0\n\nWhile its state patrol says that not every Indigenous person who is missing will qualify for the program, those that do are individuals who go missing under unexplained or suspicious circumstances and appear to be vulnerable due to reasons such as age and health.\u00a0\n\nIn her letter sent last week, Gazan pointed to the disappearances and deaths of at least four First Nations women who Winnipeg police believe were murdered by the same man.\u00a0\n\nJeremy Skibicki has been charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Morgan Harris, Marcedes Myran, Rebecca Contois and an unidentified woman whom local Indigenous leaders have been referring to as Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 22, 2023.\u00a0\n\nStephanie Taylor, The Canadian Press\n\nHave a story idea?\nReport a mistake\nThis has not been shared.

One of the cascading consequences is the vulnerabilities and disconnections that leave Indigenous women and girls open to violence.\n\n\u201cThe significance of the dresses is that they are empty,\u201d said Dorine Greene of the Quesnel Tillicum Society-Native Friendship Centre. \u201cThe significance of the dresses being red is, in Indigenous culture, red is the only colour spirits can see, so by hanging the red dresses in honour of MMIWG2+, it\u2019s a way of reuniting spirits with their loved ones, to have them close.\u201d\n\nStaff members at QJS like Tracey Telford and Rae Lee Tresierra brought that information to light, as is happening in schools the length and breadth of B.C. Red dress displays were made, and lessons were taught that described former policies that led to suffering and pain for Indigenous people right up into modern times.\n\n\u201cWe talk a lot about truth and reconciliation, but in order to have reconciliation we first have to acknowledge the truth,\u201d said Tresierra, who teaches English to the Grade 8 and 9 students at QJS. \u201cThis is the first generation of schooling to be brought up in this culture of truth and reconciliation.\u201d\n\nInformation on the red dress campaign, the moosehide campaign (raising awareness of violence against women and children), and the Highway of Tears inspired the English students to write poetry about their thoughts and impressions. The poems, and other artistic touches were all pinned to a red dress put on display as a class statement that went with other Red Dress Day acknowledgements around the school.\n\nAbbi White, Lexi Tresierra, Ewan Lackey, Molly Leung, and Lauren Gittens were some of the students who took part and talked with The Observer about their work.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a concept that was talked about for a very long time. It was really pushed to the side,\u201d said Lackey. \u201cIt\u2019s still going on today, and the Highway of Tears is right near here. If you don\u2019t know about it, you can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last residential schools closed in super modern times,\u201d said Gittens. \u201cI was talking with my mom about it, and she said she never knew any stories about residential schools, she\u2019s just learning about it now.\u201d\n\nLeung said her poem \u201cis mostly about how ignorant we are as to what Indigenous people have faced, because it wasn\u2019t taught in school, and I\u2019m very grateful that it\u2019s being taught right now, but up until this year I didn\u2019t really have knowledge of what they went through. This is spreading education, and education is what we need right now.\u201d\n\nNot long ago, Indigenous students were not positively or accurately reflected in any part of school learning. That had an impact on Tresierra, who buried her own First Nations background. She is now working to restore her personal Indigenous identity, and taking part in Red Dress Day activities with the students is a learning and growing opportunity for her, personally as well as on a professional basis.\n\n\u201cWhat we discussed, as well, is how it\u2019s also new for teachers,\u201d Tresierra said. \u201cWe are learning. Even though I come from a strong First Nations background, I also grew up with a temporary loss of identity because I obviously have white privilege (indicating her relatively light skin tone) and I tried to hide behind that, growing up. I was already susceptible to bullying, and I didn\u2019t want to be bullied for another reason as well. It sometimes takes a long time to regain that culture aspect.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: PHOTOS: Quesnel Takes Back the Night against gender-based violence\n\nREAD MORE: Red Dress Day marked in Quesnel\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tCity of Quesnel responds to mayor's legal challenge\n\t\tCity of Quesnel begins work on two park projects\n\t\t2-vehicle collision in Quesnel prompts response\n\t\tPhase 2 of Cottonwood Hill Project to begin construction\n\t\tClinton councillor on paid leave, facing four criminal charges\nFacebook Comments (0) \nYOUR VOTE MATTERS\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nWhat do you think is the most critical challenge facing the youth today?\n Mental health\n Education and employment opportunities\n Social media influence\n Peer pressure and bullying\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nTODAY IN B.C.\nEnvironment Canada issues multiple warnings as B.C. braces for weekend heat\nVIDEO: Cherry season in the pits for the Okanagan\nTargeted shooting sends man to Kamloops hospital, car into river \n2 killed in West Vancouver head-on were international students: police\nConservatives have more money than rivals, spent far more on ads\nMore from Today In BC >\n \nQuesnel Cariboo Observer\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nAdvertising\nSupport Centre\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nJoin our Team\nNews\nLocal News\nNewsletters\nSubscribe\nToday in BC\nCanadian News\nWorld News\nEntertainment\nSports\nBusiness\nTrending Now\nOpinion\nSubmit News Tips\n100 Mile House Free Press\nNeighbours\n100 Mile House Free Press\nAshcroft-Cache Creek Journal\nBarriere Star Journal\nCoast Mountain News\nClearwater North Thompson Times\nQuesnel Cariboo Observer\nWilliams Lake Tribune\nMore\nOur Community\nPublic Notices\nVideo\nPhoto Galleries\nTravel\nWest Coast Traveller\nCannabis\nToday's Home\nPodcasts\nFood\nLife\nContact Us\nContests\nPuzzles\nContests\nShop\nImpress Stories\nSavvy Shopper\nImpress TV\nAdd Your Business\nE-Editions\nClassifieds\nAll Classifieds\nBook a Print\nAuto\nToday's Drive\nAuto Showcase\nJobs\nLocalWork\nJoin Our Team\nObituaries\nCelebrations of Life\nFuneral Care Services\nIn Memory\nPlace an Obituary\nGood News\nLocal Good News\nSocial Media\nQuesnel Live\nToday in BC\nYoutube\nI love British Columbia\nI love Alberta\nI love Nunavut\nI love Yukon\nI love Northwest Territories\n\u00a9 2024 Quesnel Cariboo Observer and Black Press Media Publications Contact"},

Life Skills also did the pins (of a red dress). The large photo of the girl was done by the Indigenous Studies class. If you look up close, it is all the women in Canada who went missing that make up that picture. The (artwork) on the table was done by the English class.\u201d\n\nSchool principal Julia Corcoran was also on board, adding the project weaved its way through several different classes students are taking.\n\n\u201cThe project lends itself to lots of curricular outcomes,\u201d Corcoran said. \u201cJust being able to use art as a vehicle to share knowledge and make a change. As Rachelle said, we have a strong arts program here and a strong options program, and we do have a strong focus on Indigenous studies.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cIt was able to get a lot of kids involved, share a message and just do something that kids really could enjoy doing while learning.\u201d\n\nBell said getting teachers and students sold on the project was fairly easy.\n\n\u201cTeachers are always looking for ways to embed Indigenous culture and Indigenous ways of knowing into their classes,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSo, bringing them a project like this, where there is kind of a basis and let\u2019s see what you can do with it in your creative mind, it was great. They were able to put their own spin on it.\u201d\n\nCorcoran added plans were to have the display within the school originally.\n\n\u201cThe goal is that it would have been in our school, and people could have come in, and our kids would have been able to see it,\u201d Corcoran said. \u201cBut the fact that we are online now and we can\u2019t have the public in our building right now for extended periods of time, we did move it into an outside feature. We hope that people will take a look at the amazing work our students have done.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nWorking on the display opened up the opportunity to delve deeper into a topic that needs to come to light.\n\n\u201cIt is just starting the discussion about hard topics and being able to be comfortable having these hard conversations and being able to acknowledge that this is an issue in our country,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI think that is super important that having these conversations, even getting high school students just to discuss, is a step forward.\n\n\u201cJust being able to have a conversation about Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in a classroom is a step forward. Not everyone is going to agree, and not everyone is going to believe that this is an issue and that is okay. That is your perspective, but even just that conversation, I believe, changes a person\u2019s view on things. We are just trying to get people engaged and comfortable having hard conversations. \u201d\n\nPrincipal Corcoran believes the impact on the 100-120 students taking part will be long-term.\n\n\u201cI think every time you do a project if it opens one more person\u2019s eyes to something they didn\u2019t know about before, regardless of what project we do,\u201d Corcoran said. \u201cI am sure that there is at least one student who walked away and said, \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t know this before.\u2019 Or they had limited knowledge, and now they have a little bit more. I think we all take away from that.\u201d\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\nLATEST NATIONAL STORIES\nNEWS NEAR PEACE RIVER\nTHIS WEEK IN FLYERS"},

Having the red dresses hanging, it\u2019s a symbol of a woman taken too soon,\u201d said Denise Blomquist, Co-chair of Reconciliation Nipawin.\n\nAccording to Taken the Series, which tells the real-life stories of missing and murdered women, Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people are 12 times more likely to be victims of violence than any other woman. That rate jumps to 19 times in Saskatchewan.\n\nBlomquist said Red Dress Day is a way to highlight this issue as well as foster an environment for healing, justice, and reconciliation.\n\n\u201cI think the first step is just acknowledging the past. Canada has a very shady past when it comes to indigenous people and colonization. It really put an entire group of people at a huge disadvantage.\u201d\n\nAfter observing the red dresses hanging in the park, people can head inside Cumberland College to learn more about MMIWG2S as well as support those affected by the subject matter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put up a display area in our lobby and it has a whole bunch of resources there,\u201d added Blomquist. \u201cWe\u2019ve put out different supports and if we can\u2019t provide support services we definitely can refer people to different phone numbers or support services.\u201d\n\nThere will be a walk from Town Square to the park starting at 12 p.m.\n\nThe dress display went up on May 1 and will be taken down around the May long weekend.\n\n\u2013\n\nRachel.May@pattisonmedia.com\n\nOn Twitter: @RachelMayFM\n\nGet Social\nON AIR NOW\nCristy Beggs\n2:00 PM - 6:00 PM\nWEATHER\nMelfort, SK, Canada\n23 \u00b0C Sunny\nNipawin, SK, Canada\n24 \u00b0C Sunny\nHumboldt, SK, Canada\n23 \u00b0C Sunny\n\nEXTENDED FORECAST\n\nGabby's Country Poll\nCurrent Past\nBuzz Buzz\n\nWhich summer bugs would you be okay with disappearing for good?\n\nMosquitoes\n71% Vote\nWasps\n0% Vote\nHorse flies\n14% Vote\nSpruce Beetles (their bites are mean)\n0% Vote\nTicks\n14% Vote\nVoting Ends: Jul 8, 2024 | 12:00 PM\nRecently Played\nToby Keith\nI Wanna Talk About Me\n2 minutes ago\nDallas Smith\nFixer Upper\n7 minutes ago\nLuke Combs\nGoing, Going, Gone\n10 minutes ago\nOwen Riegling\nOld Dirt Roads\n14 minutes ago\nBrett Kissel\nAnthem\n17 minutes ago\nMore\nAccessibilityContact UsContest RulesPrivacy PolicyTerms Of Service\nCopyright \u00a9 2024.

A red dress hangs on a light fixture on National Day of Awareness for the prevention of violence against Indigenous women, also known as the Red Dress Day in Ottawa, Friday, May 5, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Spencer Colby\n\nCanada and Manitoba are partnering to launch an alert system that would inform the public when an Indigenous woman or girl goes missing, they announced Friday in Winnipeg, ahead of a national day to mark the crisis.\n\nThe long-awaited Red Dress Alert system is a bid to prevent deaths and increase safe reunions with loved ones.\u00a0\n\nStatistics Canada concluded in a report last year that the homicide rate for Indigenous women and girls was six times higher than the rate for their non-Indigenous counterparts.\u00a0\n\nA national inquiry concluded five years ago that they are 12 times more likely to go missing or murdered.\n\n\"This is a historic moment, and a major step toward ending the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse peoples,\" said NDP MP Leah Gazan, who has lead federal advocacy on the alert.\n\n\"And while we celebrate this historic moment, it is critical to remember that we are not done until a Red Dress Alert is no longer needed.\"\n\nThe Manitoba pilot is to be designed with and led by Indigenous Peoples, and is expected to help inform an eventual national alert system.\u00a0\n\nIt will be funded through moneys set aside in this year's federal and provincial budgets.\u00a0\n\nNahanni Fontaine, Manitoba's minister for women and gender equity, said she has heard from community members who believe the alert system could help reduce risk for Indigenous women and girls.\u00a0\n\n\"We look forward to working inclusively with Indigenous partners in Manitoba to find the best path forward as we build this pilot project.\"\n\nCrown-Indigenous Relations Minister Gary Anandasangaree said Winnipeg \u2014 and Manitoba writ large \u2014 is the epicentre of the crisis, and launching the Red Dress Alert there will bring forward solutions that can be implemented across the country.\n\n\"It's not the only solution, but it's a critical starting point for us to address the immediate crisis that exists.\"\n\nGazan's efforts on the file led a House of Commons committee to study the prospect for a national alert system.\n\nHer fellow MPs unanimously backed her motion in the House of Commons last year declaring the deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls a Canada-wide emergency.\u00a0\n\nThe motion also called on the federal government to fund a new alert system that would operate much like Amber Alerts.\u00a0\n\nOther North American jurisdictions already have similar alert systems, including Washington state's Missing Indigenous Person system.\n\nThe national inquiry's 2019 final report found deliberate rights violations were at the heart of violence against Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse people.\n\nWith the final report came 231 calls to justice directed toward governments, social service providers, industry and Canadians, but relatively little progress has been made to date.\n\nSheila North, former grand chief of Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak and an ex-journalist, has been a vocal advocate in ending violence against Indigenous women.\n\nShe said that while news of an alert system is welcome, she hopes expectations are kept reasonable \u2014 at least for now.\n\n\"There's going to be bumps in the road \u2014 there's going to be challenges that maybe none of us see right now,\" she said. \"Inevitably, someone is going to be disappointed.\"\n\nBut it's the starting point that matters, she said. \"I think it's high time.\"\n\nTo those who may not see the value in an alert system for Indigenous women, North said people of that identity have been shut out of many parts of society \"for so long,\" and the deaths \"are a result of it.\"\n\nThe House of Commons committee studying the alert has heard testimony from experts who stress any system should be Indigenous-led.\n\nThat's in part to mitigate the problems of police inaction and bureaucratic red tape, so that members of the public are notified of a disappearance promptly and efficiently.\n\nJennifer Jesty, who serves as the resiliency manager for the Union of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq, spoke to MPs about her own efforts to get an emergency alert system running for her communities and attempts to minimize police interference.\n\nSince September 2020, Jesty told the committee in late March that she sent out 183 alerts and reunited 67 people with their families as a result \u2014 the vast majority of whom were brought back together with their families within an hour of the alert going out.\n\n\"Because this system was designed by us, for us, we were able to create our own protocols around when, how and why an alert should or shouldn\u2019t be sent,\" Jesty said.\n\n\"There has not been one single request for an alert that has been denied, and every single alert has been sent out within minutes of receiving the information.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 3, 2024.\n\n\u2014 With files from Brittany

A red dress is hangs on a light fixture on National Day of Awareness for the prevention of violence against Indigenous women, also known as the Red Dress Day in Ottawa, Friday, May 5, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Spencer Colby\n\nOTTAWA \u2014 Canada and Manitoba are partnering to launch an alert system that would inform the public when an Indigenous woman or girl goes missing, they announced Friday in Winnipeg, ahead of a national day to mark the crisis.\n\nThe long-awaited Red Dress Alert system is a bid to prevent deaths and increase safe reunions with loved ones.\u00a0\n\nStatistics Canada concluded in a report last year that the homicide rate for Indigenous women and girls was six times higher than the rate for their non-Indigenous counterparts.\u00a0\n\nA national inquiry concluded five years ago that they are 12 times more likely to go missing or murdered.\n\n\"This is a historic moment, and a major step toward ending the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse peoples,\" said NDP MP Leah Gazan, who has led federal advocacy on the alert.\n\n\"And while we celebrate this historic moment, it is critical to remember that we are not done until a Red Dress Alert is no longer needed.\"\n\nThe Manitoba pilot is to be designed with and led by Indigenous Peoples, and is expected to help inform an eventual national alert system.\u00a0\n\nIt will be funded through moneys set aside in this year's federal and provincial budgets.\u00a0\n\nNahanni Fontaine, Manitoba's minister for women and gender equity, said she has heard from community members who believe the alert system could help reduce risk for Indigenous women and girls.\u00a0\n\n\"We look forward to working inclusively with Indigenous partners in Manitoba to find the best path forward as we build this pilot project.\"\n\nCrown-Indigenous Relations Minister Gary Anandasangaree said Winnipeg \u2014 and Manitoba writ large \u2014 is the epicentre of the crisis, and launching the Red Dress Alert there will bring forward solutions that can be implemented across the country.\n\n\"It's not the only solution, but it's a critical starting point for us to address the immediate crisis that exists.\"\n\nGazan's efforts on the file led a House of Commons committee to study the prospect for a national alert system.\n\nHer fellow MPs unanimously backed her motion in the House of Commons last year declaring the deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls a Canada-wide emergency.\u00a0\n\nThe motion also called on the federal government to fund a new alert system that would operate much like Amber Alerts.\u00a0\n\nOther North American jurisdictions already have similar alert systems, including Washington state's Missing Indigenous Person system.\n\nThe national inquiry's 2019 final report found deliberate rights violations were at the heart of violence against Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse people.\n\nWith the final report came 231 calls to justice directed toward governments, social service providers, industry and Canadians, but relatively little progress has been made to date.\n\nSheila North, former grand chief of Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak and an ex-journalist, has been a vocal advocate in ending violence against Indigenous women.\n\nShe said that while news of an alert system is welcome, she hopes expectations are kept reasonable \u2014 at least for now.\n\n\"There's going to be bumps in the road \u2014 there's going to be challenges that maybe none of us see right now,\" she said. \"Inevitably, someone is going to be disappointed.\"\n\nBut it's the starting point that matters, she said. \"I think it's high time.\"\n\nTo those who may not see the value in an alert system for Indigenous women, North said people of that identity have been shut out of many parts of society \"for so long,\" and the deaths \"are a result of it.\"\n\nThe House of Commons committee studying the alert has heard testimony from experts who stress any system should be Indigenous-led.\n\nThat's in part to mitigate the problems of police inaction and bureaucratic red tape, so that members of the public are notified of a disappearance promptly and efficiently.\n\nJennifer Jesty, who serves as the resiliency manager for the Union of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq, spoke to MPs about her own efforts to get an emergency alert system running for her communities and attempts to minimize police interference.\n\nSince September 2020, Jesty told the committee in late March that she sent out 183 alerts and reunited 67 people with their families as a result \u2014 the vast majority of whom were brought back together with their families within an hour of the alert going out.\n\n\"Because this system was designed by us, for us, we were able to create our own protocols around when, how and why an alert should or shouldn\u2019t be sent,\" Jesty said.\n\n\"There has not been one single request for an alert that has been denied, and every single alert has been sent out within minutes of receiving the information.\"\n\nThis report by The

Ending the rail line at Six Mile (the junction with the E&N) would be $770 million. In my view, the critical passenger mass \u2013 where the train would collect the largest number of passengers \u2013 is at Six Mile. The track from Six Mile to Station Avenue can be considered for a future phase.\n\nB.C. Transit also revealed just maintaining its current bus-based service would cost $250 million. A rapid bus service would cost about $550 million, but would need to be converted to LRT within 10 to 15 years. That\u2019s twice the cost for the same outcome.\n\nSo far, the provincial government has offered little more than platitudes when it comes to pitching in funds. Interestingly, when the Evergreen Line (Coquitlam to Vancouver) was announced, senior governments pledged over $800 million toward the $1.3-billion project.\n\nThe long-ago announced $14-billion Provincial Transit Plan ear-marked close to $1 billion for the Capital Region. An LRT system that will cut emissions and double ridership is a perfect candidate.\n\nAs the federal government emerges from the election campaign, it must step up to the plate as well. Its willingness to chip in for the Canada Line and Evergreen Line on the Lower Mainland should extend to LRT in the CRD.\n\nThe two-thirds funding from senior governments brings the local share of Victoria-to-Six Mile LRT to $257 million.

A red dress is hangs on a light fixture on National Day of Awareness for the prevention of violence against Indigenous women, also known as the Red Dress Day in Ottawa, Friday, May 5, 2023. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Spencer Colby\nRepublished May 06, 2024 - 9:20 AM\nOriginal Publication Date May 03, 2024 - 1:26 PM\n\nOTTAWA - Canada and Manitoba are partnering to launch an alert system that would inform the public when an Indigenous woman or girl goes missing, they announced Friday in Winnipeg, ahead of a national day to mark the crisis.\n\nThe long-awaited Red Dress Alert system is a bid to prevent deaths and increase safe reunions with loved ones.\n\nStatistics Canada concluded in a report last year that the homicide rate for Indigenous women and girls was six times higher than the rate for their non-Indigenous counterparts.\n\nA national inquiry concluded five years ago that they are 12 times more likely to go missing or murdered.\n\n\"This is a historic moment, and a major step toward ending the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse peoples,\" said NDP MP Leah Gazan, who has led federal advocacy on the alert.\n\n\"And while we celebrate this historic moment, it is critical to remember that we are not done until a Red Dress Alert is no longer needed.\"\n\nThe Manitoba pilot is to be designed with and led by Indigenous Peoples, and is expected to help inform an eventual national alert system.\n\nIt will be funded through moneys set aside in this year's federal and provincial budgets.\n\nNahanni Fontaine, Manitoba's minister for women and gender equity, said she has heard from community members who believe the alert system could help reduce risk for Indigenous women and girls.\n\n\"We look forward to working inclusively with Indigenous partners in Manitoba to find the best path forward as we build this pilot project.\"\n\nCrown-Indigenous Relations Minister Gary Anandasangaree said Winnipeg \u2014 and Manitoba writ large \u2014 is the epicentre of the crisis, and launching the Red Dress Alert there will bring forward solutions that can be implemented across the country.\n\n\"It's not the only solution, but it's a critical starting point for us to address the immediate crisis that exists.\"\n\nGazan's efforts on the file led a House of Commons committee to study the prospect for a national alert system.\n\nHer fellow MPs unanimously backed her motion in the House of Commons last year declaring the deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls a Canada-wide emergency.\n\nThe motion also called on the federal government to fund a new alert system that would operate much like Amber Alerts.\n\nOther North American jurisdictions already have similar alert systems, including Washington state's Missing Indigenous Person system.\n\nThe national inquiry's 2019 final report found deliberate rights violations were at the heart of violence against Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse people.\n\nWith the final report came 231 calls to justice directed toward governments, social service providers, industry and Canadians, but relatively little progress has been made to date.\n\nSheila North, former grand chief of Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak and an ex-journalist, has been a vocal advocate in ending violence against Indigenous women.\n\nShe said that while news of an alert system is welcome, she hopes expectations are kept reasonable \u2014 at least for now.\n\n\"There's going to be bumps in the road \u2014 there's going to be challenges that maybe none of us see right now,\" she said. \"Inevitably, someone is going to be disappointed.\"\n\nBut it's the starting point that matters, she said. \"I think it's high time.\"\n\nTo those who may not see the value in an alert system for Indigenous women, North said people of that identity have been shut out of many parts of society \"for so long,\" and the deaths \"are a result of it.\"\n\nThe House of Commons committee studying the alert has heard testimony from experts who stress any system should be Indigenous-led.\n\nThat's in part to mitigate the problems of police inaction and bureaucratic red tape, so that members of the public are notified of a disappearance promptly and efficiently.\n\nJennifer Jesty, who serves as the resiliency manager for the Union of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq, spoke to MPs about her own efforts to get an emergency alert system running for her communities and attempts to minimize police interference.\n\nSince September 2020, Jesty told the committee in late March that she sent out 183 alerts and reunited 67 people with their families as a result \u2014 the vast majority of whom were brought back together with their families within an hour of the alert going out.\n\n\"Because this system was designed by us, for us, we were able to create our own protocols around when, how and why an alert should or shouldn\u2019t be sent,\" Jesty said.\n\n\"There has not been one single request for an alert that has been denied, and every single alert has been sent out within minutes of receiving the information.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 3, 2024.\n\n\u2014 With files from Brittany Hobson in Winnipeg.\n\nNews from \u00a9 The Canadian Press, 2024\n\n\nMore News ...\niN RESPONSE: Readers have their say\nFollowing are

The teen, who was a mother to a six-month-old daughter, was to go to the movies with her friends that night, instead went to a local park where others would join her.\n\n\u201cShe was still going to school. She wanted to become a teacher she had tons of friends she was kind, she was loving, she helped out so many people,\u201d said her mother Loretta Henderson. \u201cEven though it was 13 years ago, it\u2019s still so hard.\u201d\n\nHenderson is now raising her granddaughter and speaks fondly of Krista each day. \u201cThere needs to be more awareness of missing and murdered women from all over, especially the North. It\u2019s harder for them to get the help that they need,\u201d explained Henderson.\n\nCody Halkett was sentenced in 2010 to life in prison for manslaughter in Krista\u2019s death.\n\nFor Gwenda Yuzicappi, not knowing where her daughter Amber Redman was for nearly three years was very difficult. Redman of the Standing Buffalo First Nation was last seen in Fort Qu\u2019Appelle in July 2005.\n\n\u201cHer remains were located two years and 10 months, not knowing where your daughter is, it\u2019s a lot of pain. It\u2019s a lot of emotion, depression and suicide,\u201d Yuzicappi said. \u201cAs a mother I went through so many emotions, it was very, very hard, difficult, but what I found strength in was my culture. Praying and asking for that strength, that pettiness, that humbleness as a mother, that emptiness of not knowing where your loved one is. I would not wish that on anyone at all.\u201d\n\nRedman\u2019s remains were discovered on the Little Black Bear First Nation, with Albert Patrick Bellegarde being sentenced in 2009 to life in prison for second-degree murder.\n\n\u201cI tell you, we need this to stop. I come here as a mother. I come here to speak for my daughter. I am my daughter\u2019s voice and I will continue to be her voice,\u201d Yuzicappi said.\n\nOne of the most puzzling disappearances in Regina history, which continues to stump investigators is the whereabouts of Tamra Keepness.\n\nJuly 5, will mark the 16th anniversary of when Tamra of the White Bear First Nation went missing. Each summer, the family, community and police gather in Pepsi Park to continue to raise awareness for Tamra.\n\n\u201cShe was just five-years-old when she disappeared. And it\u2019s something that you\u2019ll never forget. It stays with you. Everyday, there\u2019s something that comes up that reminds you that this little person was never found. Are we ever going to find her,\u201d Joyce Keepness, Tamra\u2019s grandmother asked.\n\nWhile Regina Police state they are actively following up on all new tips and leads, there is very little information on the disappearance.\n\nThe Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations tabled a five-article approach to honouring Indigenous women and girls, in hoping to end all forms of violence First Nations People face daily. That declaration was debated Thursday by lawmakers in the Legislature.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to remember that while we remember these individuals today, we need to be remembering them each and every day of the year,\u201d said Justice Minister Gordon Wyant. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to addressing this issue to end violence against individuals in this province, particularly Indigenous women and girls.\u201d\n\nNDP MLA Betty Nippi-Albright explained there are actions the province can adopt to make change. \u201cThe call upon all levels of government to adopt principles of change, including a focus on substantial equality and human and indigenous rights are a decolonization approach, an indigenous led solutions, recognizing distinction, cultural safety, and adoption of a trauma informed approach,\u201d explained Nippi-Albright.\n\nRed Dress Day, which started in 2010, encourages people to wear a red dress or display it, as it acts a symbol to raise awareness to the violence Indigenous women face daily.\n\n(Photo of Tamra Keepness)\n\n\u00a9 Missinipi Broadcasting Corporation | Site Design by Answers IT Consulting | Powered by WordPress"},

Those have been consulted for best practices and lessons learned, she said.\n\nMORE ON CANADA\nHurricane Beryl forces Canadian airlines to cancel flights.

But in the cases of, for example, women, sometimes people don\u2019t want to be found. Women that are fleeing, for example, domestic violence that don\u2019t want to be found by their perpetrator.\n\n\u201cWe need to do this as quickly as possible in a way that is safe,\u201d Gazan said. \u201c(Even so,) I want to push the Liberals to get this moving.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe know that every day we wait, another woman, girl or two-spirit person goes missing. We cannot support that. We need action now. We need a Red Dress (Alert) now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait forever. We are in an emergency.

McArthur remembers Madison Scott who went missing in 2011 from the Vanderhoof area. Then as she spoke of her distant cousin Mackie Basil of Fort St. James who went missing in 2013 that's when the tears filled her eyes.\n\n\"Where is she? She's out there,\" McArthur said. \"This event is about bringing the awareness to these people - some of them have been missing for 29 years and we need them to come home.\"\n\nMcArthur said it's the overwhelming reality of it that brings the tears even after so many years.\n\n\"This event isn't just for Indigenous women but for all women,\" McArthur said.\n\nThe issue to fight is the perception that women are dispensable beings, she added.\n\nLooking around at the 60 or so people who were in attendance at the highway event that began at Mr. P.G., McArthur said it felt empowering to see the support as the majority of people were holding a red dress to symbolize the vibrant life of each woman, which had now been taken away.\n\nDuring the event at the highway there was a prayer and singing as everyone stood in a circle. Then in a long procession people stood along Highway 97 with dresses raised in solidarity of their fallen sisters as the Khast'an Drummers performed.\n\nThe event then moved to the Lheidli T'enneh Memorial Park pavilion behind Exploration Place where organizer Tammy Meise said a few words of welcome and she and others spoke about their personal experiences that led them to the Red Dress Campaign.\n\nDuring the event Kelsey Abraham and his seven-year-old daughter Bella Rain performed traditional dances.\n\nAbraham said this event is especially important to recognize all missing and murdered women but it really brought it home as they honoured their family members who have been murdered and missing.\n\n\"My daughter is seven years old and her style of dance is one of healing - the junior girl's jingle,\" Abraham explained.\n\nAbraham takes opportunities like the Prince George Red Dress Campaign to talk to Bella about her personal safety as she would like to walk home alone from school. Dad doesn't think it's a good idea.\n\nTo keep the murdered and missing women in their hearts Abraham said his daughter honours them often.\n\n\"So we say her little prayers for the murdered and missing women - not only Indigenous, but women in general. To me that's important,\" Abraham said, who was dressed in traditional First Nations dance regalia. \"To always remember them we attend important events like this one and we have placed pictures of the murdered and missing women on my regalia and on Bella Rain's dress, as well. We need to keep praying for the murdered and missing women. My prayers are with my family today and all the other missing and murdered women and the families out there who need these prayers.\"\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nReport a mistake\nThis has not been shared.

The local indigenous community has given her the name Buffalo Woman (Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe).\n\nPolice believe all four women were killed by Jeremy Skibicki of Winnipeg, who was charged with four counts of first-degree murder. The 35-year-old is now in police custody. His lawyer has told Canadian media that he intends to plead not guilty.\n\nThe murders have brought renewed attention to Canada's history of disproportionate violence faced by indigenous women, which was called a \"genocide\" by a national public inquiry in 2019.\n\nA report by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 2016 estimated that around 1,200 First Nations women had been killed or gone missing between 1980 and 2012.\n\nBut the National Inquiry into Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls concluded that there is \"no reliable estimate\", and added that the RCMP's figure is narrow in scope.\n\nCanadian man accused of killing four indigenous women\nGiving a voice to missing and murdered women\nIndigenous women deaths 'a Canadian genocide'\nIndigenous Canadians\nCanada\nRelated\nSacred headdress handed over to Siksika Nation\n5 Jun 2024\nEngland\nAccused Canadian serial killer trial opens in Winnipeg\n8 May 2024\nUS & Canada\nCanadians switched at birth get an apology 70 years on\n21 Mar 2024\nUS & Canada\nMore\n1 day ago\nMessi struggling, Nunez firing - Copa America quarter-final guide\n\nBBC Sport assesses the Copa America knockout stages before the quarter-finals get under way on Friday.\n\nFootball\n6 days ago\nFirst Liberal MP calls on Justin Trudeau to step down\n\nIn an email to fellow members, MP Wayne Long said Trudeau should resign \"for the good of our country\".\n\nUS & Canada\n25 Jun 2024\nConservatives heap pressure on Trudeau with by-election win\n\nThe loss is seen as a major set back to PM Trudeau, who said he hears Canadians' \"concerns\".\n\nUS & Canada\n23 Jun 2024\nEdmonton Oilers on brink of history after thrilling comeback\n\nThey could become the first Canadian NHL team to win the Stanley Cup for 31 years after drawing level with the Florida Panthers.\n\nUS & Canada\n20 Jun 2024\nStorm Alberto claims lives in Mexico and drenches US coast\n\nThe first named storm of the season comes as much of North America swelters in brutal heat.\n\nWorld\nHome\nNews\nSport\nBusiness\nInnovation\nCulture\nTravel\nEarth\nVideo\nLive\nAudio\nWeather\nBBC Shop\nBBC in other languages\nFollow BBC on:\nTerms of Use\nAbout the BBC\nPrivacy Policy\nCookies\nAccessibility Help\nContact the BBC\nAdvertise with us\nDo not share or sell my info\nContact technical support\n\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

(2dayFM Staff)\n\nPeople across Canada, including the Kootenays, gathered on Sunday\u00a0 to hold a Red Dress Day vigil to honour missing and murdered Indigenous women.\n\nThe event is held every year on May 5 to bring awareness to the disproportionate rates of violence against Indigenous women girls and 2SLGBTQIA+ people.\n\n\u201cWe feel like women who are reporting violence, sexual violence and crimes are not being believed and heard due to the many social issues we\u2019re facing today, such as mental health and addiction issues,\u201d said Jennifer McNally, Red Dress March community volunteer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of trauma to deal with and I don\u2019t think the police forces and some laws are supporting how to move forward with taking interviews properly, treating victims with respect and dignity and actually getting some real action into finding out what\u2019s going on with missing and murdered Indigenous women.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn Cranbrook, vigil attendees marched from Street Angels to Rotary Park.\n\nAccording to a statement from the B.C. government, 490 Indigenous women and girls were victims of homicide in Canada from 2009 to 2021.\n\n\u201cIn this timeframe, the rate of homicide of First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit women and girls was six times higher than the rate among their non-Indigenous counterparts,\u201d said a written statement from Kelli Paddon, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity.\n\n\u201cIn Canada, Indigenous women and girls are 12 times more likely to be murdered or missing than any other women in Canada.\u201d\n\nMcNally hopes governments and officials will act to tackle the high rates of violence against Indigenous women.\n\n\u201cI think we need to get our MPs and politicians together to find some ways to force law enforcement to take proper, appropriate training,\u201d said McNally. \u201cOur first responders are a key essential service that we rely on every day, and I believe they\u2019d like more training.\u201d\n\nWant to get your business noticed?

Ahead of Red Dress Day, the governments of Canada and Manitoba announced a partnership to co-develop a pilot Red Dress Alert system together with Indigenous partners. This was made possible by the $1.3 million investment included in Budget 2024. Alert systems can help ensure that when an Indigenous woman, girl, Two-Spirit or gender-diverse person goes missing, they are found.\u00a0\n\n\"We stand united in affirming our unwavering commitment to addressing this national crisis and collectively working toward a secure, violence-free future for all Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit and gender-diverse people. We also recognize that means supporting grassroots, Indigenous-led and community-driven change through housing, shelters, policing, and infrastructure initiatives, such as the Inuvialuit Family Wellness Centre that provides shelter for Indigenous women and families in Inuvik, the Indigenous Victim and Family Liaison Program\u00a0that helps individuals and family members navigate culturally-appropriate health and wellbeing supports, and new rural public transit studies to better connect communities undertaken by the Nahanni Butte First Nation, Yellowknives Dene First Nation, and the Hay River M\u00e9tis Government.\n\n\"The work to end the national crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit, and gender diverse people is ongoing, and a lot more remains to be done.\u00a0The federal government is committed to learning from Indigenous partners in a way that respects our shared priorities. We will continue to use the Federal Pathway, the National Action Plan, the National Inquiry's Calls for Justice, and the National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence to lay the path forward for our work. Today, as we honour these lives, we continue our efforts to dismantle the systems that put Indigenous people in danger, and to create transformative change that will ensure every Indigenous woman, girl, Two-Spirit, and gender-diverse person in Canada has a future free from fear and violence, where their rights are protected, and respected.\"\n\nTaking Care\n\nThe Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Crisis Line is a national, toll-free, 24/7 crisis call line that provides support for anyone who requires emotional assistance related to the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit and gender-diverse people. For assistance, call 1-844-413-6649.\n\nTrauma-informed support is also available to all those impacted by the ongoing crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit and gender-diverse people through the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Health and Cultural Support Program. The program funds access to cultural support (e.g., Elders, Knowledge Holders, and Traditional Healers), emotional support (e.g., community-based health workers, peer supports), and registered mental health counsellors (e.g., psychologists, and social workers).\n\nStay connected\n\nJoin the conversation about Indigenous Peoples in Canada:\n\nX: @GCIndigenous\nFacebook: @GCIndigenous\nInstagram: @gcindigenous\n\nYou can subscribe to receive our news releases and speeches via RSS feeds.

We deal with this on a weekly basis,\u201d she said. \u201cDays like Red Dress Day are unfortunately just one day, but we need to realize that this is something that is happening every single day.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nShe encourages people to wear red on Friday in honour of victims.\n\nThe Stardale Girl Drummers practice at Bridgeland park for Friday\u2019s Red Dress Day Ceremony in Calgary on May 3.

At the beginning of 2022, the group released its recommendations and the province launched a premier\u2019s council.\n\nIn June 2022, Alberta\u2019s MMIWG Roadmap was created to guide government action to reduce violence and increase safety and economic security for Indigenous women, girls, two-spirit and LGBTQ+ people.\n\nThe Stardale Girl Drummers practice at Bridgeland park for Friday\u2019s Red Dress Day Ceremony in Calgary on May 3.

But it\u2019s for all of us to come together to understand that trauma and to try to give voice to the situation and not swipe it away under the carpet.\u201d\n\nA group of nursing students at Mount Royal University carry red dresses to hang around the campus prior to national day of awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW) on Thursday, May 4.

The film touches on the legacy and intergenerational effect of colonialism in Canada and missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.

In 2010, Black displayed an installation at the University of Winnipeg that included red dresses symbolizing the growing number of Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) nationwide.\n\n\u201cJust like the visual of the red dress itself,\u00a0 [this event] provides us with an opportunity to consider the pain and loss experienced by Indigenous people,\u201d says Copeland.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, 490 Indigenous women and girls were killed between 2009 and 2021.

The importance of the red dress is to bring attention to people about the ongoing genocide that\u2019s happening currently to Indigenous women and girls and two spirit people across the country and has been happening for a very long time, and just to bring a visual to the absence of those who are missing,\u201d said Campbell.\n\nCampbell explained that the colour red is very significant in many Indigenous cultures. \u201cIt is said in many of our Indigenous cultures that the spirits see the bright colours the best, with red being probably one of the brightest colours that we have. It is said that the spirits can see the red, and for those that are lost and haven\u2019t been found yet, the red will help their spirits find their way home to their loved ones, where they will know that they\u2019re missed, that they are loved, that they are cared for, and that we are wanting their spirits to be laid to rest,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cIt has definitely grown; there is more public awareness now, and that\u2019s been important. We do see more people that are aware; some of that has actually come about because of the recent public awareness around the gravesite discoveries at residential school sites and with the walks and things that are happening. It used to be that it was just Indigenous peoples who would come together, but we do see more public engagement in wanting to show their support and come out to events, and we encourage that because it\u2019s not just an Indigenous issue; it should be an issue that every person in Canada wants to have changed.\u201d\n\nThose who want to demonstrate their support for Red Dress Day are encouraged to wear a piece of red clothing.\n\n\u00a9 Missinipi Broadcasting Corporation | Site Design by Answers IT Consulting | Powered by WordPress"},

Despite only making up 4.3% of the population,\u00a0Indigenous women make up 16% of female homicide victims\u00a0and\u00a011% of missing women. Alberta is amongst the highest number of MMIWG2S cases. We know these numbers are likely much higher due to countless systemic and structural barriers including underreporting, inadequate investigations, and dismissal by officials.\n\nIn 2019, The National Inquiry for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls released a report titled\u00a0Reclaiming Power and Place: The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\u00a0This report was created through public hearings and evidence gathering across the country and shares the truths of more than 2,380 family members, survivors, experts and Knowledge Keepers.\n\nAs we honour Red Dress Day and remember those who have been lost, we recognize the lifelong learning and action that must be taken in response. There is a collective responsibility that we share in building a world that is safe and just for Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit people. We encourage you to learn more about MMIWG2S, colonial gender-based violence, and its lasting impacts on our communities.\n\nFor more information, consider visiting the following resources below:\n\nThe National Inquiry for MMIWG Final Report\nThe Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada\nThe REDress Project\nSafe Passage\nAn interactive map of cases of MMIWG2S to collect data and help identify patterns of violence in geographic areas.\nTedTalk by Tamara Bernard: We Are More Than Missing and Murdered\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf you or someone you know needs immediate mental and emotional wellness support, call The National Inquiry into MMIWG2S Toll-Free Support Phone:\u00a01-844-413-6649\n\nComments\nLeave a Reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\nFrequency Map\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms Of Service\nCopyright \u00a9 2024.

Attendees wore red as a symbol of solidarity.\n\nThe event started from outside the Vanderhoof RCMP station on Columbia St., where participants gathered before embarking on a march to the Highway 16 park.\n\nThe event was open to all members of the public to join and show their support for missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit people.\n\nThese community events aim to honour the lives of those who have been lost and raise awareness about this ongoing issue.\n\n\u201cPeople need to examine statistics across Canada to see how many people are missing in the country,\u201d said Saik\u2019uz Nation Chief Priscilla Mueller.\n\nLast year, Mueller\u2019s community mourned the loss of 29-year-old Chelsey Heron (Quaw), whose remains were discovered in Saik\u2019uz Territory in November, a month after her disappearance. Similarly, Nicholas John, a member of Saik\u2019uz, was found deceased near Vanderhoof five months after he was reported missing in October 2022.\n\n\u201cWe still have Jay Preston Raphael missing,\u201d Mueller added. Raphael was last seen in Saik\u2019uz in February 2023.\n\nMueller highlighted the ongoing issue of missing Indigenous women and men along Highway 16, emphasising the need for continued awareness and action.\n\n\u201cMany of our communities are located along the highway, and it appears that the issue of missing women and men along Highway 16 is not taken as seriously as we would like,\u201d Mueller said.\n\n\u201cIt is alarming. It feels as though our lives don\u2019t matter,\u201d she added.\n\nOn Red Dress Day, Mueller is calling on policymakers and community leaders to adopt more practical solutions, such as improved signage and well-lit benches, to enhance safety along Highway 16.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crucial that in 2024, we refuse to accept the disappearance of Indigenous women as a norm,\u201d she said.\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\nAbout the Author: Binny Paul\n\nRead more\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tCyberattack disrupts Four Rivers Co-op's operations in northern B.C.\n\t\tMan dies throwing candy during Alberta Canada Day parade\n\t\tTeen dies after overdose involving fentanyl in northern B.C.: RCMP\n\t\tCanada Day celebrations held in Vanderhoof\n\t\tVanderhoof Pride Society celebrates diversity amidst rising challenges\nFacebook Comments (0) \nCanada Day celebrations held in Vanderhoof\nBlack Press Media\nFreshwater Fisheries Society inaugurates new trout fishing pond in Vanderhoof\nBlack Press Media\nCanadians Born 1944-1983 Could Get This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nUnsold 2024-2025 Alaska Cruise Cabins May Be Cheaper Than You Think\nDiscover Discounts & Savings On Unsold Alaskan Cruises With These Searches.\nFavorite Searches\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\n4 Ways to Retire Comfortably With $500K in Canada\nFisher Investments Canada\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\n17-year-old dies after drowning incident in Greater Victoria\nBlack Press Media\nRemembering Tori Dunn: Campaign helps family of Surrey homicide victim\nBlack Press Media\nCanadians Born 1944-1984 Could Apply For This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nThe Best Way To See Alaska Is By Cruise - Explore All-Inclusive Offers\nDiscover Discounts & Savings On Unsold Alaskan Cruises With These Searches.\nFavorite Searches\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nThese Unsold Alaska Cruise Cabin Deals Will Leave You Speechless (See Prices)\nDiscover Discounts & Savings On Unsold Alaskan Cruises With These Searches.\nFavorite Searches\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nB.C. considers legal action against Ottawa over equalization: Eby\nBlack Press Media\n1 dead after small plane crashes at remote Yukon airport\nBlack Press Media\nYOUR VOTE MATTERS\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nWhat do you think is the most critical challenge facing the youth today?\n Mental health\n Education and employment opportunities\n Social media influence\n Peer pressure and bullying\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nTODAY IN B.C.\nEnvironment Canada issues multiple warnings as B.C. braces for weekend heat\nVIDEO: Cherry season in the pits for the Okanagan\n2 killed in West Vancouver head-on were international students: police\nConservatives have more money than rivals, spent far more on ads\nB.C. man who killed wife with hatchet is eligible for parole in 13 years\nMore from Today In B.C. >\n \nVanderhoof Omineca Express\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nAdvertising\nSupport Centre\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nJoin our Team\nNews\nLocal News\nNewsletters\nSubscribe\nToday in BC\nCanadian News\nWorld News\nEntertainment\nSports\nBusiness\nTrending Now\nOpinion\nSubmit News Tips\nNeighbours\nCaledonia Courier\nBurns Lake Lakes District News\nHaida Gwaii Observer\nHouston Today\nKitimat Northern Sentinel\nSmithers Interior News\nTerrace Standard\nThe Northern View\nMore\nOur Community\nPublic Notices\nVideo\nPhoto Galleries\nTravel\nWest Coast Traveller\nCannabis\nPodcasts\nFood\nLife\nContact Us\nContests\nPuzzles\nContests\nShop\nImpress Stories\nSavvy Shopper\nImpress TV\nAdd Your Business\nE-Editions\nClassifieds\nAll Classifieds\nBook a Print Ad\nAuto\nToday's Drive\nAuto Showcase\nJobs\nLocalWork\nJoin Our Team\nObituaries\nCelebrations of Life\nFuneral Care Services\nIn Memory\nPlace an Obituary\nGood News\nLocal Good News\nSocial Media\nVanderhoof Live\nToday in BC\nYoutube\nI love British Columbia\nI love Alberta\nI love Nunavut\nI love Yukon\nI love Northwest Territories\n\u00a9 2024 Vanderhoof Omineca Express and Black Press Media Publications Contact"},

That\u2019s about 133 a year or 3 a week.\nBecause of persistent forms of oppression (racism, colonialism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism), complaints about missing Indigenous Women, Girls, and Women, are less likely to be taken seriously or followed up.\n\nA number of events are being held locally over the next few days, including a gathering at the Civic Centre shortly before noon, followed by a ceremony raising the MMIWG flag and a walk to the Deshkan Ziibi Indigenous Hub at 495 King Street West.\n\nTomorrow, the Indigenous hub is hosting a bannock and tea and drop-in event with open conversations and teachings with an Indigenous grandmother.\n\nSunday the hub will feature drumming, giving of tobacco, and an open sharing circle.\n\nStudio Address 520 James St. Wallaceburg, ON | Main Phone 519-627-0007 | Contest Phone 519-627-0991 | News Room 519-627-0007 ext 310 news@ckxsfm.com\nListen Live\n FACEBOOK  INSTAGRAM  RSS  TWITTER  YOUTUBE\n\u00a9 2023 CKXS 99.1 - Chatham-Kent & Lambton County"},

Racism and the lack of primary care providers mean off-reserve First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit females have poorer health overall compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts, says a study by the Public Health Agency of Canada.THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck\nAugust 27, 2023 - 9:05 PM\n\nRacism and the lack of primary care providers mean off-reserve First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit women and girls have poorer health overall compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts, says a study by the Public Health Agency of Canada.\n\nCompared with non-Indigenous females, those in the three distinct groups reported a higher prevalence of diagnosed chronic diseases and worse mental health, including mood or anxiety disorders, says the study, which noted Canada's colonial history of residential schools, forced or coerced sterilization and destruction of traditional lands.\n\nResearchers used data for all females aged 15 to 55 from the annual Canadian Community Health Survey between 2015 and 2020. That amounted to 6,000 people from the three distinct groups and 74,760 non-Indigenous females, all in their reproductive years.\n\n\"Indigenous females waited longer for primary care, more used hospital services for non-urgent care and fewer had consultations with dental professionals,\" says the study, published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.\n\nLead researcher Sebastian Srugo said that while thousands of women across Canada lack a family doctor, \"those conversations are happening much, much more among Indigenous women.\"\n\n\"Even when we compare Indigenous women and people assigned female at birth to non-Indigenous counterparts of a similar age, similar education, income and living in the same places, we still have those gaps,\" Srugo said.\n\nWomen who were pregnant or had just given birth were worse off, and that could affect their children years later, he said.\n\n\"This is about intergenerational impacts of not having access to this care,\" Srugo said. \"It's also about a justifiable lack of trust that Indigenous communities have with the health-care system in Canada.\"\n\nPrimary care providers could support the women in their reproductive decisions and assess them for conditions including heart disease, depression and cancer, he said.\n\nMultiple studies have connected poorer health outcomes for Indigenous females compared to the wider population.\n\nBut Srugo said the PHAC study adds to limited research involving First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit, which have diverse cultures, languages and histories but are typically lumped together as Indigenous Peoples.\n\nThe study included 2,902 First Nations, 2,345 M\u00e9tis and 742 Inuit women and girls. Researchers also received input from an advisory committee specifically created for the project. Members were from four organizations \u2014 Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak (Women of the M\u00e9tis Nation), the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada and 2 Spirits in Motion.\n\nWhile Lee Clark, director of health for the Native Women's Association of Canada, lauded federal researchers for partnering with Indigenous organizations, she said their study should not become \"one more paper in the pile of evidence\" that has made little difference in the lives of women deprived of equitable care.\n\nResearchers themselves cited the challenges in access to care in a \"disjointed jurisdictional system, resulting in medical relocations for birthing and general health care.\"\n\nClark said she hoped the federal government would use the findings to \"hold provinces accountable\" to deliver targeted programs for women whose needs have been sidelined for too long.\n\nIndigenous communities are still deeply affected by the 2020 death of Atikamekw woman Joyce Echaquan in a Quebec hospital, where she filmed staff insulting her as she lay dying, she said.\n\n\"The majority of people I speak with in the community, we have stories of blatant racism,\" she said from Gatineau, Que. \"Colonialism isn't historic. It's ongoing. These harms are continuing and they're perpetuated still. Joyce's example is just one of the examples that was recorded.\"\n\nIn a decision earlier this month, anarbitration tribunal ordered the reinstatement of an orderly who was fired by the hospital. An arbitrator wrote that while the employee made inappropriate comments toward Echaquan, she was not responsible for most of the poor treatment the patient received compared to the \"insulting, vulgar, racist and rude remarks and behaviour'' of a nurse. That nursewas also fired for telling Echaquan that she was stupid and \"better off dead.\"\n\nClark also called on federal and provincial governments to work together to incorporate Indigenous practices in health care, including midwifery that uses traditional practices.\n\n\"Pockets of this is happening, recently in Nova Scotia. It needs to be everywhere. It needs to be more accepted. The medicalization of birth is just an outright stamp of colonialism.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Aug. 28, 2023.\n\nCanadian Press health coverage receives support through a partnership with the Canadian Medical Association.

Auditor General John Doyle's latest report on the provincial corrections system.\n\nIn addition to overcrowding in B.C. jails, nearly nine out of 10 convicted offenders in B.C. are not in custody, but are serving conditional sentences on house arrest or probation with court-imposed conditions.\n\nThe auditor found that additional staff have not kept up with the caseload, which increased 28 per cent in the past six years. And only 35 per cent of interventions that are designed to reduce re-offending are ever completed.\n\nB.C. has four core programs. They focus on male offenders of spousal assault, other violent offenders, sex offenders and substance abusers.\n\nDoyle made eight recommendations, related to improved reporting on rates of re-offence and better record-keeping. He recommended a review of staffing levels but didn't prescribe what if any increase there should be to the current staff of 450 probation officers.\n\nThe B.C. public safety ministry accepted all eight recommendations. In its response to the report, the community corrections division noted that probation officers deal with adult offenders, \"many of whom are violent and high risk.\n\n\"They deliver evidence-based programming such as the Relationship Violence Prevention Program, which has been shown to reduce re-offending by up to 50 per cent.\"\n\nNDP public safety critic Kathy Corrigan said it's encouraging that a domestic violence program can have that much success, since domestic violence is the second-largest source of of offences in B.C. after impaired driving.\n\nBut Corrigan noted that Doyle found fewer than half of B.C.'s probation officers have completed the ministry's domestic violence course.\n\nDoyle surveyed a sample of 58 domestic violence case files, and found three quarters of them contained at least one alleged breach of court-imposed conditions. He said few of the cases were documented well enough to determine if breaches of probation were dealt with in court, but there were several cases where they were not.\n\nThe report identified three cases where \"the unreported breaches involved victim contact from offenders convicted of domestic violence \u2013 and in all three cases, the offender had been assessed as being at either a medium or high risk to re-offend.\"\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tGroup of Langford kids taking Greater Victoria music scene by storm\n\t\tVIDEO: Whales off Greater Victoria captivate shoreline photographers\n\t\tNew group aims to take a run at Sooke's traffic woes\n\t\t5 earthquakes reported off Vancouver Island: USGS\n\t\tUniversity of Victoria to shut down campus pool after a half-century\nFacebook Comments (0) \n'You shattered her life': 3 years for sexual assault of young Kelowna woman\nBlack Press Media\nB.C.

By using multiple empty red dresses in the installation, it is meant to illustrate the absence of the more than 1,000 missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada.\n\nIn Owen Sound, a Red Dress Day ceremony will be held at Kelso Beach at Nawash Park, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Gichi-Name M\u2019wikwedong Reconciliation Garden.\n\nAt Saugeen First Nation, a gathering for First Nation members only is planned. It will not be open to the public, but will be for band members to engage in \u201cdiscussion and planning on the continuing issues and factors that contribute to missing and murdered indigenous people and impacts on our community,\u201d says an event posting.\n\nThat conversation is expected to also include discussion about a proposed Red Dress Alert. The alert is an idea proposed by Winnipeg NDP MP Leah Gazan and would function similarly to an Amber Alert, for missing Indigenous women, girls and Two-Spirit people.\n\nStatistics on the government of Canada\u2019s department of justice website say Indigenous women represent 10 per cent of the total population of missing women in Canada. The page says \u201cin 2014, the rate of homicide of Indigenous women (3.64 per 100,000) was almost six times higher than non-Indigenous women (0.65 per 100,000).\u201d\n\nRecommended for You\nRecommended by\nLatest News\nOPP Investigate Vandalism At Several Sites In Walkerton\n10m ago\n \nHousehold Hazardous Waste Event Coming To Paisley\n3h ago\n 8 Views\nGeorgian Bluffs Council Endorses Fire Prevention Agreement With Owen Sound\n6h ago\n 20 Views\nMeaford Pair Accused Of Stealing Appliances & Furniture From Air BnB\n11h ago\n 116 Views\nMore\nON AIR NOW\nRick Ringer\n5:00 PM - 8:00 PM\nLocal Weather\n\n23.2\u00b0C\n\nMostly Cloudy\nWind: W 7 km/h\n\nObserved at: Wiarton Airport\nLast updated: Thursday July 04, 2024 at 17:00 EDT\nSource: Environment and Climate Change Canada (license)\n\n Full Forecast...\nRecently Played\nBay City Rollers\nSaturday Night\n1 minute ago\nStampeders\nOh My Lady\n6 minutes ago\nLittle Peggy March\nI Will Follow Him\n8 minutes ago\nMelissa Manchester\nYou Should Hear How She Talks About You\n12 minutes ago\nGo Go's\nWe Got The Beat\n17 minutes ago\n See More\nAccessibilityPrivacy PolicyTerms Of Service\nCopyright \u00a9 2024.

It took the whole community to come together and everybody was searching everywhere. Months later we found her brutally beaten and murdered. Ever since they we decided that we needed answers.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nJones says her family along with many others have no closure, with many cases remaining unsolved. She and her family continue to honour her sister since she was found 46 years ago.\n\n\u201cShe was a happy-go-lucky person. She\u2019d bring the sunshine in the rainstorm,\u201d she says. \u201cShe left us two beautiful children that we treasure and we have gatherings in her name, and keep going until hopefully we find an answer.\u201d\n\nShe says they are hoping to work with the younger generations to help them prevent what has happened from happening to them.\n\n\u201cOur main goal is to work with the younger generation,\u201d says Jones. \u201cTo teach the younger generation safety and to be aware of their surroundings.

The red dresses act as a visual reminder of all of the missing women, girls, and Two-Spirit people.\n\nJaime Black, a M\u00e9tis artist, was the driving force behind the Red Dress movement.\n\nHer\u00a0REDdress art installation\u00a0inspired a grassroots movement across North America that has evolved into Red Dress Day \u2014 a visual symbol of the grief and loss suffered by victims\u2019 families and survivors, bringing awareness to the genocidal crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous women.\n\nBlack created the art installation, which consisted of 600 community-donated crimson dresses that were placed in public areas throughout Winnipeg and later across Canada, to draw attention to the gendered and racialized nature of violent crimes against Indigenous women and to evoke a presence through the marking of absence.\n\nBlack chose the colour red after conversations with an Indigenous friend who told her red is the only colour the spirits can see.\n\n\u201cSo (red) is really a calling back of the spirits of these women and allowing them a chance to be among us and have their voices heard through their family members and community.\u201d\n\nJaime Black\n\nBlack has also suggested red \u201crelates to our lifeblood and that connection between all of us\u201d and that it symbolizes both vitality and violence. The dresses are empty, so that they evoke the missing women who should be wearing them.\n\nThe discrimination, racism and inequality left by the legacy of residential schools, the 60s scoop and ongoing colonization affect women and people of colour the most. We must move forward to end the violence against MMIWG2S+.\n\nThis day is meant to raise awareness about the ongoing harm and remembering those who have gone missing or died. Here are some of the ways you can help:\n\nStaying educated and up to date\nLearn about Indigenous Canadian history from the Indigenous perspective.\nRead the final report from the National Inquiry.\nListen to the truths shared.\nAcknowledge human and Indigenous rights violation and their impact.\nBecome an ally\nContinue to educate yourself.\nSupport others in every relationship and encounter you take part in.\nSupport the community \u2013 Amplify the voices of BIPOC.\nBe respectfully active in the community.\nActively work to break down barriers.\nSpeak out against racism, sexism, ignorance, homophobia and transphobia in the home, work, and community.\nTeach or encourage others to do the same.\nCall on your elected officials to move forward with the 231 Calls for Justice.\n\n\u00a0\n\nComments\nLeave a Reply\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\nFrequency Map\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms Of Service\nCopyright \u00a9 2024.

We\u2019re hoping for a good turnout, which we have had in the past. We\u2019ve had several different walks and tried different things and we decided to stick with Townsite to Willingdon Beach.\u201d\n\nPallen said there is a need to communicate about missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW), girls and two-spirited people.\n\n\u201cWe are working toward supporting and lifting up affected people,\u201d she added.\n\nTo many First Nations, Pallen explained following a previous Red Dress Day walk, red is the only colour spirits can see.\n\n\u201cWhen we wear red, we are hoping to call back the missing spirits of the women and children so we can lay them to rest,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are still a lot of people who are going missing, and for our people, First Nations people across the country and Canada, it\u2019s been really challenging for their spirits.\n\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019d like to see it stopped. This is not something that\u2019s normal for us to be doing. We shouldn\u2019t be here, standing up and talking about all of the women who went missing and their families that are suffering.\u201d\n\nJoin the\u00a0Peak's email list\u00a0for the top headlines right in your inbox Monday to Friday.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nLetter to the editor\nReport a mistake\nThis has been shared 1 time\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nRelated\n\tPowell River Search and Rescue team answers atypical call\n\tPowell River Spring Garden Tour includes seven stops\n\tAuction and high-tea on Texada raises funds for seniors housing\n\nCOMMUNITY POLL\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nDo you take your yard waste to a green waste facility for recycling?\n Yes\n No\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nTRENDING TODAY\n1\t\nUpdated: Injuries sustained in Highway 101 crash near Halfmoon Bay\n\n2\t\nSunshine Coast SAR responds to Canada Day callout to Smuggler Cove \n\n3\t\nSpy-hopping whales caught on camera in Porpoise Bay June 29 \n\n4\t\nSechelt \u2018turmoil\u2019 and \u2018dysfunction\u2019 identified in governance audit\n\n5\t\nOpinion: My promise to you is to never call the Sunshine Coast an 'island' \u2013 hopefully\n \nNews\nLocal News\nOpioid Crisis\nCOVID-19\nIn the Community\nBC News\nNational News\nIndigenous News\nWorld News\nReal Estate\nBusiness Wire\nLocal Sports\nNational Sports\nCannabis News\nAnimal Stories\nDigital Edition\nOpinion\nOpinion\nSend us a letter\nArts & Life\nLocal Arts\nLiving\nPhotos and Videos\nAutomotive\nFood\nHealth\nConsumer Technology\nThe Mix\nEvents Calendar\nMore Lifestyes\nFeatures\nWeatherhood\nDriving\nGas Prices\nGuidedBy\nSponsored Content\nTourist Guide\nSpotlight\nHomes\nClassifieds\nView Classified Ads\nPlace a Classified Ad\nObituaries\nLocal Obituaries\nView Legacy Obituaries\nPlace an Obituary/In Memoriam\nConnect\nAdvertise\nContact Us\nDaily Headlines Email\nSupport Local News\nAbout\nContact\nAbout\nAdvertise\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms and Conditions\nPolitical Ads Registry\nVisit our network of sites:\nBowen Island Undercurrent\nBurnaby Now\nBusiness in Vancouver\nCastanet\nCoast Reporter\nDelta Optimist\nLethbridge Herald\nMedicine Hat News\nMoose Jaw Today\nNew West Record\nNorth Shore News\nPique Newsmagazine\nPowell River Peak\nPrince George Citizen\nREW.ca\nRichmond News\nSaskToday.ca\nSquamish Chief\nThe Orca\nTimes Colonist\nTriCity News\nVancouver is Awesome\nWestern Investor\nAirdrie Today\nCochrane Today\nLakeland Today\nMountain View Today\nOkotoks Today\nRocky Mountain Outlook\nSt. Albert Gazette\nTown and Country Today\n\n\u00a9 2024 Coast Reporter"},

Songs of strength, the singing for those who cannot.\u00a0\n\nRed dresses hang on trees, a symbol of lost lives, at a candlelight vigil in a park that bears the name of Inuk artist Annie Pootagook, whose death was declared suspicious by police.\n\n\"Annie Pootoogook\u00a0is such an inspiration to our communities and what message does it send with what happened to her. What message does that send to our children that no matter how high up they make it, it doesn\u2019t matter,\" says Mikka Komaksiutisak with Tungasuvvingat Inuit\n(opens in a new tab)\n. \"And that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today\u00a0to protect our children from future harm and to stop this from happening with our community.

She had moved into an apartment and did not know her roommate. Nikolas Ibey has been charged with first-degree murder in connection to Pikuyak's death.\n\n\"I am here to honour her memory and the other women and girls that have gone missing or have been murdered,\" Arnatsiaq said. \"This does not have to happen anymore. It should not be happening anymore, so this is a powerful way of getting the word out that this is wrong, that this has to stop.\"\n\nSixty-three per cent of Indigenous women have experienced violence and nearly half have experienced sexual assault, according to a 2022 Statistics Canada report.\n\n\"This is a genocide and it stems from systemic racism within society that we have to live today,\" says Brandy Stanovich, MMIWG2S+ Manager with the Native Women's Association of Canada\n(opens in a new tab)\n.\u00a0\"It\u2019s very important to understand the history, understand the causes around it and understand the work that needs to be done.\"\n\nOn Friday, the NWAC hosted youth council members from across the country, who discuss, share and ultimately help to resolve the individual issues faced in each province and territory.\n\nA new painting unveiled, which will be added to the NWAC MMIWG2S+ Vault Exhibition Space, including a large panel of handcrafted dolls, made by family members of missing and murdered loved ones.\u00a0\n\n\"This was painted by a Mi\u2019Kmaq artist Alan Syliboy\u00a0in honour of MMIWG2S+,\" Stanovich said. \"He painted this so Creator will always find them.

Recognized Canada-wide, the day honours the lives of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQ people. (Jane Skrypnek/Black Press Media)\nListen to this article\n00:03:48\n\nSunday marks Red Dress Day across Canada and First Nations leaders in B.C. are using it to call on the federal government to take action on the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2021, 490 Indigenous women and girls were killed in Canada, a number six times higher than that experienced by their non-Indigenous counterparts. Indigenous woman are also far more likely to go missing and to experience physical and sexual violence.\n\nThe systemic issues driving this crisis were highlighted in June 2019 when the National Inquiry into MMIWG released its final report, Reclaiming Power and Place. In it, the commissioners made 231 Calls for Justice, but few have been fully implemented in the nearly five years since.\n\nOn Sunday, the B.C. Assembly of First Nations, First Nations Summit and the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs called on Canada to take action.\n\n\u201cIt is shameful that the violence and fatalities of Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ peoples continue unabated in Canada and represent a tragic ongoing crisis that highlights the systemic injustices and vulnerabilities of First Nations communities. Canada must address the related issues and establish a clear timeline for implementing the 231 Calls for Justice,\u201d BCAFN Regional Chief Terry Teegee said in a statement.\n\nREAD ALSO: Red dresses at B.C fashion show honour missing and murdered Indigenous women\n\nREAD ALSO: Indigenous domestic violence victim shares her story and her Red Dress Day display\n\nChief Marilyn Slett, the UBCIC secretary-treasurer highlighted the violence Indigenous women and girls are more likely face around labour camps. In the Reclaiming Power and Place report, commissioners said they were told by expert witnesses that \u201cresource extraction can drive violence against Indigenous women and girls in several ways, including issues related to transient workers, harassment and assault in the workplace, rotational shift work, substance abuse/addictions, and economic insecurity.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Slett said it is essential to address these safety concerns, especially given the prevalence of labour camps in B.C.\n\nCheryl Casimer, a First Nations Summit political executive, emphasized the discrimination and mistrust Indigenous people are more likely to face when interacting with police and the justice system.\n\n\u201cThis is evident in the biased treatment, inadequate investigations, and a lack of accountability for perpetrators.\u201d\n\nShe called for urgent policing reforms.\n\nB.C.\u2019s parliamentary secretary for gender equity also marked the day with a statement.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that we continue to uplift and listen to the voices of Indigenous people and support self-determination of Indigenous communities in taking steps towards healing and justice. We also must address the root causes of violence, including colonialism, racism and misogyny,\u201d Kelli Paddon said.\n\nB.C. responded to the National Inquiry\u2019s final report on MMIWG by developing its own strategy in June 2021 called A Path Forward, which commits to preventing, protecting and responding to violence against Indigenous women and girls. The province has funded it with $10.8 million, as of March 2023.\n\nREAD ALSO: Canada, Manitoba to develop Red Dress Alert for missing Indigenous women, girls\n\nREAD ALSO: \u2018I just about became a missing, murdered woman\u2019: Kelowna Red Dress march\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tEverybody loves a parade!

We need to have these standards upheld so we are given the respect and dignity owed to put an end to the ongoing violence inflicted daily.\u201d\n\nThe FSIN is calling for the implementation of the 231 Calls to Action contained in the final report issued by the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\n\n\u201cOur First Nations Women and Girls must be protected from the unacceptable levels of violence experienced in Canadian society and our communities,\u201d Chief Bobby Cameron said. \u201cThe time has come to acknowledge the truths and findings in The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Women and Girls and to strive to create safer communities for all, through education and awareness.\u201d\n\nSask. lawmakers are expected today to debate the declaration.\n\nNDP MLA Betty Nippi-Albright explained there are actions the province can adopt to make change. \u201cThe call upon all levels of government to adopt principles of change, including a focus on substantial equality and human and indigenous rights are a decolonization approach, an indigenous led solutions, recognizing distinction, cultural safety, and adoption of a trauma informed approach,\u201d explained Nippi-Albright.\n\nRed Dress Day, which started in 2010, encourages people to wear a red dress or display it, as it acts a symbol to raise awareness to the violence Indigenous women face daily.\n\n\u00a9 Missinipi Broadcasting Corporation | Site Design by Answers IT Consulting | Powered by WordPress"},

[Photo: Gerry Lampow 106.1 The Goat/Vista Radio]\n- Advertisement -\n\nTo learn more about why Red Dress Day is important, students from several schools including Bishop Lloyd visited the Lloydminster Native Friendship Centre on Friday.\u00a0\n\nRed Dress Day is observed every year on May 5 to honour the missing and murdered Indigenous women and people who have been lost by their families.\u00a0\n\nThe students took part in a pipe ceremony in the morning, then walked from City Hall to the Clock Tower, and then back to the centre for lunch. After lunch, a mother who had lost both her sister and recently her son shared through her tears the tragedy of her loss.\u00a0\n\nAurora Champagne who is in grade eight said they learned about the culture and about the numbers of Indigenous people who go missing in Canada.\u00a0\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI personally learned how many people go missing that are Indigenous. When I was younger, I always thought that it was not that many. But it\u2019s a lot more than I thought.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIndigenous women are 12 times more likely to go missing or murdered than non-Indigenous women, according to a national survey. Stats Canada noted the homicide rate for Indigenous women and girls was six times higher than the rate for non-Indigenous.\u00a0\n\nThe 14-year-old reflected that listening to Freda share about the loss of her family members was \u201chard to listen to.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cShe was talking about how her sister got murdered and so did her son. I couldn\u2019t imagine having that happen to someone in my family.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe students also learned about the meaning of the red dress.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt symbolizes the blood of the girls who went missing and got murdered. And it also symbolizes how the family still thinks of the heart pumping in their thoughts and in their prayers.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe day which began at 10:30 a.m. wrapped up at 2 p.m.\u00a0\n\nThe next event being planned by the centre will be Indigenous Peoples Day on June 21.\n\n- Advertisement -\nFacebookTwitterReddItWhatsAppEmail\n- Advertisment -\n- Advertisment -\n- Advertisement -\nContinue Reading\nNews\nDesign of passing lanes for Highway 17 North planned for 2025\nNews\nLashburn gets $83K SGI grant for pathway for recreation facility\nNews\nCity property inspections north of 44 Street this summer\nNews\nMen\u2019s Shelter head to run across Alberta, Saskatchewan in August fundraiser\nLoad more\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\nIN THE NEWS\n\nDesign of passing lanes for Highway 17 North planned for 2025\n \nLashburn gets $83K SGI grant for pathway for recreation facility\n \nCity property inspections north of 44 Street this summer\n \nMen\u2019s Shelter head to run across Alberta, Saskatchewan in August fundraiser\n \nAlberta, Saskatchewan premiers to discuss energy at Lloydminster Heavy Oil Show in September\nLocal trio score Synergy Shares Scholarships\n \nAlberta and Saskatchewan discuss healthcare in Lloydminster\n \nOccupied RV hijacked and crashed at Weaver Park Campground\n \nAlberta health minister meets Saskatchewan health minister in Lloydminster\n \nLloydminster hosts U11 Girls Advanced Provincials\nLloydminster golfers take their shot at RBC PGA Scramble, Jul. 13\n \nLoon Lake RCMP seek suspect\n \nOn average seven people die in July due to impaired driving: SGI\n \nLakeland College Rustlers teams hosting conference finals in 2025\n \nPolice seek Jordan Keenan-Quewezance, advise do not approach\nThe GOAT\u2019s Christmas Wish\n \nEXCLUSIVE: Lloyd Homeless Issued $580 Fines, Evictions\n \nCanadian Indigenous Music\n \nDONATE TO THE GOAT\u2019S CHRISTMAS WISH \u2013 OCTOBER 19\n \nGoat Christmas Wish Radiothon\nNews\nWin\nEvents\nContact Us\nAdvertise\nWe\u2019re Hiring"},

PHOTO BY GREATER SUDBURY POLICE\nArticle content\n\nBy Kelly Geraldine Malone\u00a0\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe head of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada says it\u2019s clear there\u2019s an ongoing emergency nearly four years after the final report into missing and murdered Indigenous woman and girls was released.\n\n\u201cWe are in a crisis,\u201d said Carol McBride.\n\nRed dresses were on display across the country Friday to recognize the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People. It has become known as Red Dress Day and the empty garments serve as a symbol of lives that have been lost.\n\nEach year there are more events, rallies and art displays. Despite the increased awareness and an extensive national inquiry, McBride said the situation that Indigenous girls and women face has not substantially changed.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a mother. I\u2019m a sister. I\u2019m an aunt,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just imagining some of our families and our women are suffering right now.\u201d\n\nThe inquiry\u2019s final report was released in 2019 and included sweeping calls for change. It found Indigenous women and girls are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than any other group in Canada.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau accepted the findings of the inquiry, which said the crisis amounted to genocide.\n\nSixty-three per cent of Indigenous women have experienced violence and nearly half have experienced sexual assault, Statistics Canada said in a report last year.\n\nWinnipeg has been called ground zero.\n\nAt least 28 Indigenous women in Manitoba have died due to violence since May 2020, said Sandra DeLaronde, team lead for the Manitoba MMIWG2S+ implementation team. The majority were in Winnipeg.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nA group hung 101 red dresses along a chain-link fence outside a landfill in the Manitoba capital over the winter. Winnipeg police have said the bodies of four Indigenous women were disposed of in landfills last year.\n\nThe remains of three of the women have not been found. A man has been charged with first-degree murder in the killings of the four women.\n\nThe remains of another Indigenous woman were also found in a landfill earlier this year. Police said her death is not a homicide.\n\n\u201cWhen I think (about it), I cry,\u201d DeLaronde said. \u201cI have to focus on the thousands of women and girls that are still here and how we can keep them safe.\u201d\n\nDeLaronde said it\u2019s important to recognize that Indigenous people are sacred, and they should not only be honoured when they are gone.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe House of Commons unanimously backed a motion Tuesday declaring the deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls a Canada-wide emergency. It also called for funding a new system to alert the public when someone goes missing.\n\n\u201cThe truth is the truth,\u201d said Leah Gazan, the Winnipeg member of Parliament who presented the motion. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to acknowledge truth. It\u2019s another thing to act on it.\u201d\n\nThe Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada has criticized the federal government for not doing more or acting fast enough. McBride said Tuesday\u2019s motion was an important step, but there is more to do.\n\nMost of the money announced to fulfil the inquiry\u2019s 231 calls to justice became stuck in government bureaucracy, DeLaronde said, and it has not made it to the front lines and the Indigenous women and families who need it.\n\nDeLaronde added that all Canadians should use Red Dress Day to reflect on what they can do to create change.\n\n\u201cRed Dress is a movement that people can get behind, because it\u2019s an opportunity to transform the very fabric of this country.\u201d\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 5, 2023.\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\nNEWS NEAR KENORA\nTHIS WEEK IN FLYERS"},

Afua Baah has the details.\n\nBy Afua Baah\n\nPosted May 5, 2024 6:57 pm.\n\nSunday marked\u00a0Red Dress Day, also known as the National Day for Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People (MMIWG2S). This year, at Toronto Metropolitan University, the school\u00a0put together their first outdoor Red Dress Day exhibit.\n\nThe pieces of scarlet clothing unearth a painful part of her family\u2019s history for one local resident.\n\n\u201cMy little sister is on the list, she was murdered in the \u201960s, and there\u2019s no justice for her,\u201d said Bernice Lengarde, who has multiple family members on the MMIWG2S list. \u201cI also have cousins who are on the list, and their murders remain unsolved.\u201d\n\nRed Dress Day was inspired by an installation project by M\u00e9tis\u00a0artist Jamie Black. The stark exhibit aimed to highlight the horrors many Indigenous women and girls have had to endure in their lives.\n\n\u201cIt helps educate those who don\u2019t know about the MMIWG2S, it helps them to understand that as Indigenous people, what we\u2019ve had to live with, and what we have to go through every day, and all these things are still happening today,\u201d said Lengarde.\n\nIn a report last year, Statistics Canada said between 2009 and 2021, the homicide rate among Indigenous women and girls was six times higher than their non-Indigenous counterparts.\u00a0A national inquiry\u00a0five years ago found\u00a0that they are also 12 times more likely to go missing or murdered.\n\nMany advocates have continued to\u00a0sound the alarm\u00a0on this horrific trend for years, with little movement until last week. On Friday, Canada and Manitoba announced a partnership for a Red Dress Alert system that would inform the public when an Indigenous woman or girl is reported missing.\n\nLocal resident Leslie Johnston also took time on Sunday to remember the victims, saying the community and governments can do more to be better allies.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had calls to action \u2026 and yet they\u2019ve not been implemented, and it\u2019s really upsetting and disappointing. We expect the calls to action to be implemented,\u201d\u00a0said Johnston.\n\nThe exhibit at Toronto Metropolitan University will be open to the public until Monday at 5:00 p.m., where the display will conclude with a berry offering for the spirits.\n\nSubmit a Correction\nAccessibility Feedback\nLive Radio\nConnect with CityNews\nTrending Now\nTorontonians can now toss their used coffee cups in the blue bin\nThe 680 NewsRadio Toronto Weather Guarantee\u2122\n1 dead, 2 others injured in crash on eastbound Gardiner\nUnion says LCBO contract talks have broken down, Friday strike looms\nFirst GST/HST credit payment from 2023 tax returns set to arrive July 5\nTop Stories\nUnion says LCBO contract talks have broken down, Friday strike looms\n\n5m ago\n\nTorontonians can now toss their used coffee cups in the blue bin\n\n57m ago\n\nThe Spadina Sprint: A CityNews experiment\n\n5h ago\n\nWeekend need-to-know: Summerlicious begins and salsa takes over St. Clair\n\n2h ago\n\nMost Watched Today\n3:28\nUnion, province remain far apart in LCBO negotiations\n\nWith less than 24 hours away from a possible strike at LCBO stores across Ontario, the union says they are still far from reaching a deal in negotiations with\u00a0the province.

However, due to pandemic restrictions, the ceremonial unveiling cannot take place as planned.\n\n\u201cOf course, due to COVID 19 we decided that it wasn\u2019t safe to do such an event at this time, but we didn\u2019t want to let the day go by unrecognized,\u201d said Lesley Manuel, Information Services and Support Officer.\n\n\u201cAs BC\u2019s only Indigenous public post-secondary institution we are affected by this crisis on a daily basis. We have students from all across BC and Canada, who know of the story of at least one of the victims at some point,\u201d continued Manuel.\n\n\u201cWith this unveiling, we were expecting to not only speak about this crisis, but to create awareness of the violence that is happening to our life-givers and women warriors, and that we need to come together to help the victims and their families, to be their voice. As an aboriginal institution, we feel the need to help wherever we can.\u201d\n\nDespite no official ceremony on May 5, NVIT will go ahead with placing the dresses at both campuses. At the Merritt campus, the cabinet in which the dress is displayed, will be positioned on the main floor at the entrance to the eatery, and will be a permanent fixture.\n\n\u201cThis will help honour, and let our students know that we are not forgetting these missing and murdered women,\u201d said Manuel.\n\nWhen it is safe to do so, an official ceremony will take place at both the Burnaby and Merritt campus.\n\n\u201cThe students will hopefully be back in the fall, and once our students come back and we can all gather, we\u2019ll have a ceremony and have our unveiling on both campuses,\u201d said Kris Billy, Community Education Assistant.\n\nNVIT staff encourage people to help raise awareness for MMIWG, and the issues of gendered and racialized violence, by wearing red on May 5. Billy also hopes to see the people of Merritt hang red dresses from trees and fences on the day as well, to represent the \u201cstolen sisters\u201d who have had their lives cut short and will no longer return to their families.\n\nSHARE:\n\n \nPREVIOUS\nFlorentine giving up Complex Care License\nNEXT\nRED DRESS DAY: A history of the Highway of Tears\nRELATED POSTS\nLetter of referral approved for foreign entrepreneur\n\nApril 9, 2021\n\nMerritt receives $24 million grant for flood recovery\n\nApril 14, 2022\n\nMedical marijuana users win court-ordered reprieve\n\nMarch 27, 2014\n\nLessons in debt control ? consolidate to save\n\nApril 18, 2013\n\nNEWSLETTER\n\nFirst Name \n\nLast Name \n\nEmail address: \n\nCLASSIFIEDS\nMedical Office Assistant Position June 19, 2024\nSales Person/Office Admin May 15, 2024\nNVCL April 4, 2024\nRECENT OBITUARIES\nAlan Norman Clarence Taylor June 19, 2024\nFay Sturney June 19, 2024\nBeverly Jean Malchuk June 19, 2024\nSister Newspapers\nBowen Island Undercurrent\nBurnaby Now\nBusiness in Vancouver\nCastanet\nCoast Reporter\nDelta Optimist\nLethbridge Herald\nMedicine Hat News\nMoose Jaw Today\nNew West Record\nNorth Shore News\nPique Newsmagazine\nPowell River Peak\nPrince George Citizen\nREW.ca\nRichmond News\nSaskToday.ca\nSquamish Chief\nThe Orca\nTimes Colonist\nTriCity News\nVancouver is Awesome\nWestern Investor\nAirdrie Today\nAlberta Prime Times\nCochrane Today\nLakeland Today\nMountain View Today\nOkotoks Today\nRocky Mountain Outlook\nSt. Albert Gazette\nTown and Country Today\nOther Sections\nAbout Us\n\nAdvertise\n\nReal Estate\n\nClassifieds\n\nEvents\n\nMagazines\n\nSubscribe\n\nContact Us\n\nConnect\n\nMerritt Herald\n#201- 1951 Garcia Street,\nMerritt, BC V1K 1B8\n\nPhone\n1-250-378-4241\n\nAberdeen Publishing \u00a9 Copyright \u00ae\u00a02020.\u00a0\u00a0All rights reserved.

The Government of Canada has a duty to Indigenous peoples and must take a leadership role, financially and otherwise, in implementing an MMIWG2S+ \u201cRed Dress\u201d alert system.\n\nWe also call on the Federal Government to urgently address violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2S+ people and stop delaying important measures like the Red Dress Alert, because every moment is critical to saving lives.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nOn Red Dress Day, we remember and continue to draw strength from the resilience and courage of our loved ones who have been lost to violence.

PHOTO BY ROB O'FLANAGAN /Postmedia Network\n\nKyLanna Linklater, 14, said she has experienced fear of violence when she walks the streets in Saskatoon. Indigenous people make up about five per cent of the Canadian population, but Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people are 12 times more likely to be murdered than other groups in the country, they said.\n\n\u201cNow, to be able to fight for what I believe is right, is just amazing,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cIt is very special to finally have other advocates around you and to be an activist yourself. Even though we\u2019re teenagers, I feel it is awesome that we have people who will listen to us. We can be heard, and we can help others be heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really take a lot of joy and happiness in being involved in the community and seeing justice happening,\u201d said student Jinnoah Smith, 15. \u201cBeing about to go out and make a difference in the societal issues we have today is so important and special to me.\u201d\n\nTeacher Naila Chaudry said Collective Voice looks at the curriculum through a social justice lens, with an eye to understanding the issues facing communities.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cOne thing we value in education is a lived curriculum,\u201d Chaudry said. \u201cEducation is not merely knowing, it\u2019s taking that knowledge and doing something with it. Collective Voice helps students to learn about their past, about our history and current situations, but also to engage in a way that is meaningful.\u201d\n\nJinnoah Smith said they were raised in a family where social justice issues were openly discussed.\n\n\u201cSo I never understood the concept of how you could hate someone for being who they are,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI always wanted to help change that. I love making a difference. I always wanted to have the passion to help the people around me and do the most that I can.\u201d\n\nWhile many see the future as bleak, Linklater sees its potential.\n\n\u201cI think anything can be resolved,\u201d they said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of what we, the people, do about it. We can make change happen. We are all so motivated to make everyone equal and to make up for everything awful that happened in history.\u201d\n\nRECOMMENDED FROM EDITORIAL\nArt exhibit opens, Red Dress Day commemorated at Saskatchewan Legislature\nThe strength to speak: Faith Bosse's mother was taken 19 years ago.

The ongoing epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and 2S+ people is a national tragedy that demands urgent action and attention.\n\nWe support the call by MP Leah Gazan and others to implement a public alert system to inform all Canadians when an Indigenous woman, girl, or 2S+ person goes missing. The Government of Canada has a duty to Indigenous peoples and must take a leadership role, financially and otherwise, in implementing an MMIWG2S+ \"Red Dress\" alert system.\n\nWe also call on the Federal Government to urgently address violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2S+ people and stop delaying important measures like the Red Dress Alert, because every moment is critical to saving lives.\n\nOn Red Dress Day, we remember and continue to draw strength from the resilience and courage of our loved ones who have been lost to violence. On Red Dress Day, we honor their lives and commit ourselves to the important work of ensuring that no more Indigenous women, girls, and 2S+ people are lost to violence.\n\nMedia Contact\nFor media interviews please contact:\nHana Sabah, CAP Communications support\nCell: (514) 834-8841\nEmail: hana@impactcanada.com\n\nBackground\n\nThe Congress of Aboriginal Peoples (CAP) is the second-oldest national aboriginal organization in Canada. It was founded in 1971, one year after the AFN. CAP represents the interests of off-reserve status and non-status Indians, M\u00e9tis and Southern Inuit Aboriginal Peoples throughout Canada. CAP is one of five national Indigenous organizations recognized by the federal government, and holds consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council.\n\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/165058\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\n\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

After the blessing attendees were asked to head to the atrium by the main entrance of the NVIT building to witness the unveiling of the red dress in the cabinet display.\n\nThe cabinet for the red dress display was created by a silent volunteer who had heard about NVIT indiginization committee\u2019s planned display.\n\n\u201cIt was a complete donation and it turned out beautiful,\u201d said Lesley Manuel, assistant to VP for students at NVIT.\n\nThe memorial garden was funded by Women and Gender Equality Canada in 2019, however, due to the pandemic, operations were severely delayed.\n\nLocated at the green space by the main parking lot, the memorial consists of a pit house surrounded by five landscaping boulders, courtesy of the City of Merritt. There is also a sign that is dedicated to the MMIWG and LGBTQ2S+ individuals.\n\nThe pit house was stained red to represent the MMIWG movement and there were several red dresses hung on the surrounding trees as per the suggestion of fellow MMIWG advocate, Krista Fox.\n\nNVIT students Melissa Moses, Chelsea Johnnie, and Keaton Robinson built the pit house with the assistance of instructor, Clayton Anthony.\n\nAlthough the space is now open, NVIT is still making plans to add a water feature to the memorial. Water has spiritual significance and is symbolic for healing for the families and loved ones affected by this issue.\n\nSHARE:\n\n \nPREVIOUS\nInterior Savings waives fees and commits $5000 to support Ukrainian refugees\nNEXT\nRCMP seize sawed off rifle after assault\nNEWSLETTER\n\nFirst Name \n\nLast Name \n\nEmail address: \n\nCLASSIFIEDS\nMedical Office Assistant Position June 19, 2024\nSales Person/Office Admin May 15, 2024\nNVCL April 4, 2024\nRECENT OBITUARIES\nAlan Norman Clarence Taylor June 19, 2024\nFay Sturney June 19, 2024\nBeverly Jean Malchuk June 19, 2024\nSister Newspapers\nBowen Island Undercurrent\nBurnaby Now\nBusiness in Vancouver\nCastanet\nCoast Reporter\nDelta Optimist\nLethbridge Herald\nMedicine Hat News\nMoose Jaw Today\nNew West Record\nNorth Shore News\nPique Newsmagazine\nPowell River Peak\nPrince George Citizen\nREW.ca\nRichmond News\nSaskToday.ca\nSquamish Chief\nThe Orca\nTimes Colonist\nTriCity News\nVancouver is Awesome\nWestern Investor\nAirdrie Today\nAlberta Prime Times\nCochrane Today\nLakeland Today\nMountain View Today\nOkotoks Today\nRocky Mountain Outlook\nSt. Albert Gazette\nTown and Country Today\nOther Sections\nAbout Us\n\nAdvertise\n\nReal Estate\n\nClassifieds\n\nEvents\n\nMagazines\n\nSubscribe\n\nContact Us\n\nConnect\n\nMerritt Herald\n#201- 1951 Garcia Street,\nMerritt, BC V1K 1B8\n\nPhone\n1-250-378-4241\n\nAberdeen Publishing \u00a9 Copyright \u00ae\u00a02020.\u00a0\u00a0All rights reserved.

Federation of Labour conference as a member of the Hospital Employees' Union.\n\nWhen Meise stepped inside the convention centre what she saw literally stopped her breath.\n\nShe looked up to see a stunning display of beautiful red dresses hanging from the rafters.\n\nMeise had to take a moment to read what the display was all about. It was Jaime Black's The Red Dress Project that brings awareness to the missing and murdered aboriginal women across Canada.\n\nThe art display had a great impact on Meise and she never could shake it.\n\nThis year Meise saw how far reaching the issue of missing and murdered women is in Canada and quickly realized that because the many local women who have been lost were not all aboriginal she needed to take her idea and make it more inclusive.\n\n\"I was mulling it over and mulling it over and I realized I just had to do this,\" said Meise, who works in Northern Health's mental health and addictions department.\n\n\"The Prince George Red Dress Campaign will bring awareness and give a voice to all murdered and missing women.\"\n\nThe event will begin Monday with Mr. P.G. at the corners of Highway 16 and 97 holding a flag in honour of the occasion.\n\n\nOn Sunday, Oct. 2, about 100 people will meet at the Petro Canada west of town at 1:30 p.m., with a police escort, and line up along the highway each holding a red dress on a hanger to symbolize those lost and murdered along the Highway of Tears.\n\n\"It's an empty dress - they are no longer here - and this is to give back a voice to those that were taken so these women are not forgotten regardless of race,\" said Meise.\n\nOnce the group takes a stand, they will be attending at Lheidli T'enneh Memorial Park where the red dresses participants held along the highway will be hung in the trees around the Kiwanis bandshell in the park.\n\nAt 5 p.m. a city official will say a few words, along with a First Nations elder and chief, and performers including singer-songwriter Kym Gouchie, from the Lheidli T'enneh Nation, and traditional drummers and dancers. A candlelight vigil will follow to honour the missing and murdered.\n\n\"There was never any closure for me about Kari,\" said Meise.\n\n\"I am hoping this is my healing journey and if I can open this up to someone else to walk one step on their healing journey, well you know what? It was worth it.\"\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nReport a mistake\nThis has not been shared.

The display is located on the front lawn of the museum and includes informational signage for those who drive a loop of the museum\u2019s driveway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing that we can do to participate,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cAt museums, it\u2019s our job to decolonize and create spaces where the stories and words of Indigenous people can be heard. Especially, I think, because the museum historically was found using the collections of European settlers, and so it\u2019s important to create the space for Indigenous artists and for the history of Indigenous people.\u201d\n\nRed Dress Day was inspired in 2010 by Jamie Black, a M\u00e9tis artist based in Winnipeg, who hung hundreds of empty red dresses in public places to represent missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, and raise awareness.\n\nRed Dress Day is held annually on May 5, the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) and Two-spirited people.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, the rate of homicide of Indigenous women in 2014 was almost six times higher than non-Indigenous women.\n\nAs part of their recognition of Red Dress Day, the Museum of Dufferin had a special ribbon skirt created by Sharon Rigby, a local Indigenous artist. The ribbon skirt is on display inside the museum.\n\n\u201cI am of Haudensaunee/Algonquin heritage and have spent the last three years exploring and learning many different elements of my culture. When I am creating, I am in a safe space. The noise of the world fades and the hum of good energy permeates my very being and the air around me,\u201d said Rigby. \u201cMaking this skirt was different. The hand appliques show in degrees, my grief and sadness concerning MMIWG. The first two hands are stitched on with a straight stitch and red thread. The second hand I painted a red border around the hand as I started to cry. The third hand I stitched in zigzag messily through my tears.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with the Free Press, Robinson talked about the display\u2019s community impact.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chance for people to reflect, remember, and take action to do their own research on what Red Dress Day is and what it represents. It\u2019s for everyone to become aware of the thousands of Indigenous women, girls and two-spirted people who have been subjected to disproportionate violence in Canada.\u201d\n\nThe Red Dress Day display at the Museum of Dufferin will remain up until May 12.\n\nRobinson noted that the local museum has worked with community elder Karen Vandenberg on how the dresses will be respectfully stored after the display is taken down.\n\nSharon Rigby\u2019s ribbon skirt commemorating Red Dress Day will remain on display in the museum throughout May.\n\nFor those interested in seeing the piece in-person, the operating hours of the Museum of Dufferin are Tuesday to Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\n\n\nReaders Comments (0)\n\n\n\nName (required)\n\n\nEmail Address (required)\n\n\nWebsite (optional)\n\n\nPlease note: Comment moderation is enabled and may delay your comment.

ANNA McKENZIE, THE DISCOURSE, LOCAL JOURNALISM INITIATIVE\n\nA few weeks ago, I created a small community activity that encouraged families to decorate boats and float them in local waterways and post photos on social media. As I delivered little wooden boats to interested participants\u2019 home, I came to one house that had a red dress hanging from a tree at the edge of the driveway.\n\nHanging red dresses honours and acknowledges missing and murdered Indigenous women. Use of this symbol began in 2010 and is known as the Red Dress Project, originating in Manitoba. Now many different initiatives and organizations promote red dresses to bring awareness to missing and murdered Indigenous women.\n\nWhen I drove up to the home and saw the dress intentionally hanging from a tree, I felt an emotional response. Hanging a red dress is a strong statement and it demonstrates solidarity.\n\nI am not sure why that one dress connected with me, but I think it is because I didn\u2019t expect to see it. It made me feel appreciation for the people who took the time and effort to hang the dress and make the statement. These statements spark conversations between people and make space for everyone to be reminded.\n\nRed dresses have been popping up on our highways for months now, as part of a local initiative that started on Family Day in February, and dresses continue to appear.\n\nThe red dresses bring awareness to an uncomfortable but needed conversation. These dresses represent people and their families. When I see a red dress, I know it represents someone who is gone.\n\nI was disappointed to watch the video of two men removing red dresses along the highway south of Ladysmith. The act is disrespectful and hurtful. We do not know the story behind these actions, but it undermines the work of the people who hung them. It silences this movement and sends the message that these stories should not be told.\n\nIt is not easy to see the dresses, because they are meant to remind all of us of the harsh reality that Indigenous women and families face. By having the dresses on display, it demonstrates this an issue that affects everyone, regardless of their heritage. We are all a part of the community, and everyone in our community deserves to be safe.\n\nI have spoken with people whose family members are missing or murdered. I\u2019ve known Indigenous women who have been victimized while hitchhiking along highways. These are tragedies that occur across Canada.\n\nIt was beautiful to see Stz\u2019uminus First Nation and the Town of Ladysmith come together to hang red dresses last weekend where others had been torn down. It is acts like this that demonstrate this is an issue that everyone needs to address and acknowledge together.\n\nOn Vancouver Island, red dresses can be seen hanging along the highway from Victoria to Port Hardy. We may not be travelling the highways right now, but if you see a red dress hanging in your neighbourhood, take a moment to reflect on what it represents.\n\nThis is not just an Indigenous issue, it is a community issue. Everyone has the right to be safe. There are grieving families who struggle to find answers, and hanging a red dress, or taking the time to reflect on what they symbolize, can be a step forward in working together.\n\nMay 5th is the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and is also known as Red Dress Day.\n\ncharla@makola.bc.ca\n\nCharla Huber is the Director of Communications and Indigenous Relations for M\u2019akola Housing Society.\n\nSee a typo/mistake?\nHave a story/tip?\nThis has not been shared.

(Ethan Ready, MyPGNow staff)\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cWhen I saw that art project, it spoke to me.\u201d\n\nTammy Meise, the woman responsible for bringing the Red Dress Society to the City of Prince George, reflected on what brought on the urge to raise awareness for missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\n21 years ago, Meise\u2019s childhood friend was murdered, only to have her body later found at the high watermark of the outflow of Little Lillooet Lake. While she wasn\u2019t killed along the Highway of Tears, Meise points out that nonetheless, her friend is still a victim.\n\nThe REDress Project was initially started by a Winnipeg-based Meti artist by the name of Jaime Black nearly ten years ago.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nA group setting up at the intersection of Highway 16 and 97, honouring the victims of the Highway of Tears. #CityofPG #HighwayOfTears pic.twitter.com/fft02UZfns\n\n\u2014 Ethan Ready ?\ufe0f (@EthanReady) September 8, 2019\n\nBlack collected hundreds of donated red dresses that were then later displayed in public spaces across Canada, including the Canadian Museum of Human Rights for a one-day display.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why I was chosen to do this,\u201d Meise told MyPGNow. \u201cI just know that I was, that I needed to be a part of something bigger than myself, to hold a safe space for other people that needed to walk their healing journey. It\u2019s where we support one another.\u201d\n\nShe added that the Red Dress Campaign acts as a way to give a voice back to all the women and girls who have been taken.\n\n\u201cWhen we do this year after year, we ensure that they\u2019re never forgotten.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s schedule fo events kicked off with the \u201cStand In\u201d at the intersection of Highway 16 and 97.\n\nThere, they marched together, red dresses in tow as they lined along the side of the highway.\n\nWhile the day marked the Society\u2019s schedule of events here in Prince George, it was also designed to help boost awareness for the official event, which is held on October 4th, which marks National Day of Vigils to Remember Murdered and Missing Aboriginal Women.\n\nAccording to the April 22, 2016 background on the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, from 1980 to 2012, Indigenous women and girls represented 16 per cent of all female homicides in Canada while representing only 4 per cent of the female population in Canada.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nA 2011 Statistics Canada report estimated that from 1997 and 2000, the rate of homicide for Aboriginal females was almost seven times higher than other females.\n\nThose driving by the iconic Mr PG over the next little while may notice a new flag waving in the hand of the timberman.\n\n\u201cThis flag right here, it\u2019s the Prince George Red Dress Society\u2019s actual official flag. It goes up at the beginning of the week, and that to us is the kickoff to the campaign. People see the flag and then they start the conversation, whether it\u2019s good, bad, or ugly\u2026 it starts the conversation.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSomething going on in the Prince George area you think people should know about?\nSend us a news tip by emailing pgnews@vistaradio.ca.\n\n- Advertisement -\nFacebookTwitterReddItWhatsAppEmail\n- Advertisment -\n- Advertisment -\n- Advertisement -\nContinue Reading\nNews\nNew website looks to protect tenants from bad faith evictions\nNews\nPG Chamber of Commerce critical of City for borrowing money for Aquatic Centre upgrades\nNews\nPG Pride Society preparing for annual pride week, ending with parade\nNews\nWorkSafe urging employers to be conscious as heat wave approaches\nLoad more\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\nIN THE NEWS\n\nNew website looks to protect tenants from bad faith evictions\n \nPG Chamber of Commerce critical of City for borrowing money for Aquatic Centre upgrades\n \nPG Pride Society preparing for annual pride week, ending with parade\n \nWorkSafe urging employers to be conscious as heat wave approaches\n \nSeven week old Cariboo Regional District strike is now over\nCity of Quesnel responds to petition filed against it by Mayor Ron Paull\n \nBC Transit to provide new bus shelters in PG\n \nTimberwolves land Spanish shooting guard\n \nFour Rivers Co-op cardlock locations fully operational after cybersecurity incident\n \nBrendan\u2019s Sports Shorts; Thursday, July 4th\nCanadian Indigenous Music\n \nMornings with Carol\n \nAfternoons With Tim Gavin\n \nPG SAC Voices, With Lynnell and Kendra\nCanadian Indigenous Music\n \nVinyl Power\n \nThe Morning Breath with Robert and Silvio\n \nMiddays With Kurt Flesher\n \nThe Afternoon Drive With Ryan Mitchell\nNews\nWin\nEvents\nContact Us\nContest Rules\nAdvertise\nWe\u2019re Hiring"},

It means remembering and honouring our loved ones that have not made it home yet and standing with my relatives and the communities that have been affected.\u201d\n\nShe said it\u2019s also a reminder of the ongoing issues surrounding\u00a0ongoing issues with gender-based violence, especially against Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit individuals.\n\n\u201cWe must take a stand for the rights of Indigenous people while underscoring the importance of equality and justice. It\u2019s also a reminder that we as a society must recognize and address the disproportionate violence and discrimination faced by Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit people as a result of colonialism, racism, and patriarchy.\u201d\n\nNippi-Albright added that people must\u00a0commit to taking meaningful action to address the systemic violence and injustice faced by Indigenous people and that we have to listen to and center the voices and experiences of Indigenous communities in our efforts to create that meaningful change.\n\nIndigenous artist Teagan Littlecheif\u00a0said Red Dress Day means a chance to highlight the struggles indigenous women face, specifically around violence.\n\n\u201cIt raises awareness about the disproportionate violence faced by Indigenous women,\u201d she said. \u201cIt honours their lives and advocates for justice.\u201d\n\nIndigenous women and girls in Canada remain highly overrepresented as victims of violence. Between 2009 and 2021, the homicide rate among Indigenous women and girls was six times higher than their non-Indigenous counterparts, Statistics Canada said in a report last year.\n\nKim Coltman, organizer of the two-day Revolutions Red Dress Fashion Festival in Kamloops,\u00a0says the eight designers taking part in the festival have created items to honour Red Dress Day.\n\n\u201cFor the majority of them, they have been touched by this issue personally,\u201d Coltman says.\n\nColtman\u2019s mother was a residential school survivor from Red Pheasant Cree Nation in Saskatchewan.\u00a0\n\nColtman also describes herself as survivor. Her childhood was marred by stays in foster care. She was abducted and assaulted as a teen. She says she knows all too well the world that Indigenous women can live in.\n\nIt was fashion that empowered Coltman. She signed with a modelling agency in 1972 and later created her own.\u00a0\n\nBut the issue of violence toward Indigenous women and girls remained close to her heart.\u00a0\n\nWhen she saw the red dress movement, Coltman says she was inspired, and in 2015 she founded Fashion Speaks International. The organization has produced fashion shows in Canada, Australia and France highlighting Indigenous designers, models and artists. Each show also brings attention to missing women through stories and photos.\n\nColtman says it\u2019s powerful watching Indigenous models hold their heads high as they walk the runway. It breaks behaviours pushed on the estimated 150,000 Indigenous children who were forced to attend residential schools, she says.\n\n\u201cThe residential school taught them that they were to be seen not heard, and they were to look at their feet when they walk,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to make our people less invisible.\u201d\n\nDarlene Okemaysim-Sicotte has been on the front lines working to end violence against Indigenous women in Saskatchewan for nearly two decades.\u00a0\n\nAs co-chair of Iskwewuk E-wichiwitochik (Women Walking Together), she has supported many families of those who have disappeared.\u00a0\n\nOkemaysim-Sicotte says red is a colour ancestors can see, so it\u2019s powerful to see red garments placed in public spaces across the country.\u00a0\n\nBut, Okemaysim-Sicotte adds, it\u2019s important people look beyond the dresses to the women they represent.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe are doing this because of the missing people, and they shouldn\u2019t be forgotten,\u201d she says.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey need to be remembered.\u201d\n\nA support line is available for those impacted by missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and Two-Spirit+ people.

A day where hearts hang heavy as red dresses drape with honour, and pride throughout numerous communities across the nation to remember and raise awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, and Girls (MMIWG) who were taken too soon, and lost to the hands of violence.\n\nTsow-Tun Le Lum Society which means \u2018helping house\u2019 partnered up with Cowichan Tribes for the first time, to hold an event to remember, educate, and raise awareness for all the women, girls, men, boys, and two-spirited that have gone missing. The rain did not stop all walks of life from coming out in droves to walk or run 5k, or 10k while creating a sense of community at 5574 River Rd. in Duncan. The event opened at noon, and the walk began shortly after 1 p.m.\n\n\u201cFor some reason, in some people\u2019s heads, our lives are not worth as much as other people\u2019s, other women\u2019s lives,\u201d said Tsow-Tun Le Lum Society executive director Nola Jeffrey. \u201cIt\u2019s our men too, and our boys that have gone missing, so it\u2019s important that we come out and that we walk together, and I mean all nations walking together to create awareness and to stop this. To say every child matters, every human being matters, every woman matters.\u201d\n\nRed Dress Day, also known as the Red Dress Campaign, sparked from the REDress Project which was first conceived on May 5, 2010 in Winnipeg, Manitoba through the inspired work of M\u00e9tis artist Jamie Black. When Black was told by one of her Indigenous friends that red is the only colour spirits can see, and that is actually a callback for spirits to be among us again, a red dress became the catalyst for her display at the University of Winnipeg. It featured many hung empty to honour and symbolize all Indigenous women and girls lost to violence.\n\nREAD MORE: Red Dress Day honours Canada\u2019s missing and murdered Indigenous people\n\nThe annually recognized Red Dress Day draws attention to more than 1,000 Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in Canada.\n\nThe country continues to take steps towards truth and reconciliation. It was earlier this week on May 2, that the House of Commons adopted a motion to declare ongoing violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people a national emergency. This news was announced during the opening ceremony before the walk got underway in Duncan, inspiring applause from all in attendance. It was heartwarming to witness a large, wet crowd come together to raise awareness after years of the pandemic preventing community events. However, COVID did not cease Tsow-Tun Le Lum from continuing to raise awareness and educate the masses through their virtual event they held in 2021 which spanned 60 days.\n\n\u201cWe were already active prior to COVID, and then we did this,\u201d said Jeffrey. \u201cWe had well over 3,000 people register for the virtual walk, and people were posting their walks daily. It was just not across B.C. but all across Canada as well. We had a logo contest the year prior to design shirts, and mailed out over 3,000 shirts that year.\u201d\n\nAll that came out for the cause were invited to stay for food, performances, and closing remarks and prayers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely important for the community to come together on this day,\u201d said Jeffrey. \u201cWhat the families want and really need is to be able to come together, and share their stories, and see how they can get support, and how they can get information. I think that we don\u2019t forget, that we always remember, and one of the teachings I talk about is coming from a place of love, a place of caring, a place of kindness, so that we can have respect and honour for each other. Most importantly it lets the families know that they are not alone, and that there are places like Tsow-Tun Le Lum that they can reach out to, and that we have supports for them.\u201d\n\n\nchadd.cawson@cowichanvalleycitizen.com\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\nAbout the Author: Chadd Cawson\n\nRead more\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tEditorial: Bypass of Duncan corridor not worth it\n\t\tDuncan to get new $7-million urgent and primary care centre\n\t\tPolice ask for help to find man missing from Youbou\n\t\tBig Brothers Big Sisters Cowichan chapter forced to shut down\n\t\tCongratulations to the Cowichan Secondary Class of 2024\nFacebook Comments (0) \nStolen Duncan school backpack leads to 15-month jail sentence\nBlack Press Media\nPort Coquitlam convicted murderer dead in Greater Victoria institution\nBlack Press Media\nPeople Born 1944-1984 Could Get This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nRead More\nCanadians Born Before Before 1972 With No Life Insurance Are Taking Advantage Of This\nCovered For Life\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nClaim Your Secret Bonus: 25 Free Spins on Top of the Usual Bonus\nReviewer reveals Trust Pilot Ratings and a Secret Bonus at Canada's Top Online Casino.

The event was part of Red Dress Day.\nArticle content\n\nMay 5 was Indigenous Red Dress Day and students at Elliot Lake Secondary School (ELSS) wanted to public to remember the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women, Girls and Two Spirit People.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nMore than 50 Indigenous and non-Indigenous students and adults took part in the march for Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People (MMIWG2S) National Day. (Two-spirit people are gays/lesbians in the Native population.)\n\nJenifer Brousseau, Algoma District Board of Education Indigenous grad coach at ELSS, says she and the Indigenous students organized the event and opened it up to anyone who wanted to take part. As they were preparing for the march the call went out to assemble in the school\u2019s courtyard.\n\n\u201cQuite a few non-Indigenous students joined, and my heart was just so happy. That says a lot about where these students are at in understanding Truth and Reconciliation, and solidarity and how important this is. It was a beautiful thing. All the teachers were very moved.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe goal of the day is to raise awareness of the injustices against First Nations people.\n\n\u201cThe number they (government) have put out there is well below. The number they have out there has been over 4,500 women, girls and two spirits missing, but the number goes far beyond that,\u201d says Brousseau.\n\nPartner abuse and human trafficking are a big part of the murdered and missing.\n\nBrousseau wanted to bring the issue into the light because many of the girls will be heading to college and she wanted them \u201cto understand and be really aware. I was saying to them as sisters look out for each other, and with the young men that were there look out for your sisters, especially because that is really becoming a problem.\u201d\n\nThis area is targeted because of its proximity to Lake Huron.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cAnywhere a ship can come in is a place of concern. We have ships coming in all along the North Shore. This is also a huge problem in Thunder Bay. But I feel that our territory is under the radar and the speaking out about it.\n\n\u201cThey are often targeting specific demographics, especially if there are any addictions or anything like that as well. So, often they don\u2019t get reported.\u201d\n\nShe says she has heard of some women on First Nations in this area being followed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really scary.\u201d\n\nBrousseau in one case the woman, who was riding in her car, believed she was being followed by what looked like a police car, but something didn\u2019t feel right. So, she called the police station and gave them the licence number and the police told her to drive directly to the detachment. The police caught the people in the other car.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cI feel like there\u2019s something sinister that goes much deeper than we realize when it comes to human trafficking.\u201d\n\nBrousseau says prior to coming to this area, she was an actor in theatre and in a number of film productions, including the docudrama \u2018The Pig Farm\u2019. The 2009 film is about serial killer Robert Pickton who was charged in connection with the deaths of 26 women over a period of years at his pig farm in Port Coquitlam, B.C. However, he claimed to have killed 49 women (Canadian Encyclopedia).\n\nIn The Pig Farm her role was of Georgina Papin, who was murdered by Pickton.\n\n\u201cI met her daughter. The impact of playing a role of these women and then the family\u2026.\u201d\n\nIn her role she had a meat hook under her chin.\n\n\u201cIt was really, really graphic. It was traumatizing. There was no counsellor after, and I really wished that there was to process what I was a part of.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 6\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nShe says she wants to impart the emotions she felt while playing such roles to the students.\n\n\u201cThat was the demographic with addictions\u2026, it didn\u2019t take much to lure these women in. Some of these women realized what was happening and were able to get away, but most of them didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe says acting in films like that \u201cIt was a scary role to play even when they were filming it. It\u2019s so close to home\u2026 that could be me. In hindsight I realize that many of the roles I played, I\u2019ve played missing and murdered women many times. It impacted my entire life.\u201d\n\nBrousseau plans to hold this event next year and make it bigger \u201cso that awareness is out there. These traffickers are coming around into Elliot Lake too. I want our kids safe, and I want them aware.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 7\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nShe adds that some might believe that because we live in Northern Ontario, they\u2019re safe.\n\n\u201cBut where the world\u2019s at right now, we just need to be aware. We can\u2019t live with blinders on, we have to make sure that we recognize there are some sick things at play out there.\u201d\n\nSome people just disappear and are never heard from again, she explained.\n\n\u201cNow here I am all these years later and I\u2019ve done a lot of amazing things as an artist, but I get to come back home and share all these things with these youth and this just happens to be one of those things that is really important to me.\u201d\n\nDuring the march, many had a red handprint on the face across their mouths. Brousseau says the red handprint on the face \u201cit speaks to Indigenous people who have been silenced by violence, and that the blood is on their hands.\u201d\n\nShe says people \u201cneed to understand that this is a real thing. And just because we\u2019re in Elliot Lake we\u2019re not immune to the possibility of going missing or something horrible happening.\u201d\n\nShe says if someone suspects they are being followed they should contact the police.\n\nPhoto by KEVIN McSHEFFREYOn May 5, a group of Indigenous and non-Indigenous students at Elliot Lake Secondary School marched from the school to the Collins Hall to raise awareness of the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women, Girls and Two Spirit People.

The REDress Project was started in 2010 by Metis artist Jamie Black to raise awareness about the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in Canada.\n\nThe campaign and installation are hosted by the Kumugwe Cultural Society, The IHOS Gallery and The Transition Society with support from many organizations and businesses.\n\nThis is the third year the installation will be in the Comox Valley.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just an Indigenous issue; all Canadians need to better understand the violence against Indigenous women,\u201d explained organizer Lee Everson.\n\n\u201cOur hope and vision are that other communities across B.C. and Canada hang a red dress and raise awareness.\u201d\n\nBy hanging a red dress, organizers hope all Canadians will become part of the conversation about missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nIf you would like to show your support it\u2019s as simple as hanging a red dress in a front yard or place of business or storefront. Organizers encourage everyone to share this information with friends, family, co-workers and within your community and hang a red dress.\n\nFor more information contact Lee Everson at 250-702-6740.\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n\nAbout the Author: Erin Haluschak\n\nErin Haluschak is a journalist with the Comox Valley Record since 2008.

Laurentian\u00d5s Indigenous Student Affairs (ISA) office recognized the campaign by inviting a number of guest speakers. A workshop was also held as part of the event, which was held in the Indigenous Sharing and Learning Centre\u00d5s Round Room. \u00d2The Red Dress campaign involves the hanging of red dresses to symbolize the many Indigenous women victimized by violence who are murdered and missing,\u00d3 said Roque in a press release. John Lappa/Sudbury Star/Postmedia Network\nArticle content\n\nSince the 2010 inception of M\u00e9tis artist Jaime Black\u2019s ongoing art series, The REDress Project, heightened awareness has been brought to the staggering number of murdered and missing Indigenous women across Canada.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe Red Dress campaign that stems from Black\u2019s art series has been honoured by Laurentian University since 2016. This year, Laurentian\u2019s Indigenous Student Affairs (ISA) office recognized the campaign with an event held in the Indigenous Sharing and Learning Centre\u2019s Round Room on Feb. 14.\n\n\u201cThe Red Dress campaign involves the hanging of red dresses to symbolize the many Indigenous women victimized by violence who are murdered and missing,\u201d M\u00e9lanie Roque, the Indigenous Student Affairs\u2019 events and media coordinator said in a release. \u201cOn Feb. 9, red dresses were hung across campus in solidarity.\u201d\n\nHistorically and disproportionately, Indigenous women are affected by violence, organizers of the event said. They are also over-represented in statistics of Canadian women who are murdered and missing.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cTo honour the Red Dress Campaign and the spirits of murdered and missing individuals, we (invited) guest speakers to join us,\u201d said Roque.\n\nThis included members from the Greater Sudbury Police Service who discussed their efforts about the elimination of violence against women, girls and those who identify as 2SLGBTQQIA+.\n\nTanya Debassige from the Family Information Liaison Units attended virtually. She discussed this program and how it supports family members of murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls.\n\nA pre-recorded address by Navaeh Pine, a member of Garden River who advocates for missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and two spirits and the Every Child Matters movement, was also screened in the Indigenous Sharing and Learning Centre\u2019. Pine is an award-winning speaker who addresses human rights issues.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nKristy Corbiere, a facilitator, hosted a Red Dress workshop in the afternoon, Roque said. The completed dress will then be displayed every year at the annual Red Dress Campaign event.\n\n\u201cAs you are walking through campus and see the red dresses hanging along with our posters, it\u2019s important to note that this does not reflect the actual numbers,\u201d noted Mary Laur, director of the Indigenous Sharing and Learning Centre.\n\n\u201cWhen taking a moment to pause and reflect on the tens of thousands of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and 2SLGBTQQIA, we have to remember that one was too many,\u201d Laur said.\n\nThe Laurentian community and the community in general were invited to attend the Red Dress Campaign event.

(Contributed)\n\nA Vernon woman is upset after she allegedly received a hand-written letter from a postal worker citing the red dress hanging in front of her door was impeding mail delivery to her house.\n\nWendy Chambers is a part of a local Indigenous elders group, Journey with Elders, and she wants to use this opportunity to educate people on the Red Dress movement.\n\nShe took to a popular local Facebook group, Vernon Rant and Rave, to address her concerns. She explained that she hung the dress in her doorway on May 5 for National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, where it has remained for over two months.\n\n\u201cI am completely disappointed in the letter carrier\u2019s note in my mailbox,\u201d Chambers wrote to the group. \u201cIt would seem to me that this person is completely unaware of the Red Dress movement and #MMIWG because if she was, perhaps she\u2019d have a little more understanding.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Okanagan Indian Band hosts red dress event in Vernon today\n\nRELATED: Family remembers mother at Red Dress Walk\n\nThe note in question reads, \u201cObject which is hanging impedes delivery to the mail box.\u201d\n\nIn her post, Chambers also wrote, \u201cAs a unionized, Canada Post employee, she has the right to complain but\u2026was it really necessary?\u201d\n\nChambers said that the note was left in her mailbox the morning of Wednesday, July 10 but no mail was delivered to her that day.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Canada Post said in an emailed statement to The Morning Star that they will be apologizing to Chambers and understands the importance of the awareness campaign.\n\n\u201cThis was an unfortunate misunderstanding as the letter carrier was unaware of the significance of the Red Dress hanging in the doorway,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cWhile she had been delivering the mail to this address for weeks, the carrier decided recently to leave a note saying it had been impeding her ability to deliver. This was not the formal process, she did not mean any disrespect and deeply regrets the situation now that she is fully aware of the significance of the Red Dress.\u201d\n\nChamber\u2019s post garnered a lot of attention online with more than 170 comments, over 70 reactions and nine shares by Thursday morning.\n\nRELATED: Missing and murdered Indigenous women remembered at Vernon rally\n\nRELATED: Action imperative on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls\n\n\u201cI knew when I made that post that it would cause controversy and the whole point is to raise awareness on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and educate people,\u201d Chambers told The Morning Star. \u201cPeople can\u2019t change something unless they are aware of it. Awareness and education are key.\u201d\n\nShe explained that she is very passionate about the cause.\n\n\u201cI do have a personal story about my great-grandmother and what happened to her over 100 years ago and I fail to see where much is changed,\u201d she said.\n\nShe told The Morning Star that her great-grandmother was abandoned on Kamloops government steps in 1896, when she was 15-years-old.\n\n\u201cShe had been so badly abused she had to have an eye removed and an arm amputated. They housed her in the local jail\u2026it goes on.\u201d\n\nChambers, who is working on a book which will tell the full story, also noted that a painting she created is currently being shown at the Awakening the Spirit art show at the Vernon Community Arts Centre and also speaks to the MMIWG movement.\n\nTo report a typo, email:\nnewstips@vernonmorningstar.com.\n\n\nFollow me on Twitter @BrieChar\nEmail me brieanna.charlebois@vernonmorningstar.com\nLike us on Facebook.\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tSouth Surrey pub earns heritage distinction\n\t\tSouth Surrey parents urge change to suicide language\n\t\t'Colonization 2024': Semiahmoo chief responds to criticism on land\n\t\tProtesters 'denounce' presence of Israel at Canada Cup in South Surrey\n\t\tPerson struck, killed by train in Surrey Thursday morning\nFacebook Comments (0) \nHead-on crash kills 2, blocks access to BC Ferries terminal\nBlack Press Media\nSouth Surrey farming family reacts after First Nation announcement\nBlack Press Media\nAlways Keep a Bread Clip in Your Wallet, Here's Why\nLifeHackGuru\n|\nSponsored\nPeople Born 1944-1984 Could Get This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nRead More\nStudent Discovers Genius Device to Wipe Out Mosquitoes Instantly!\nTop Review Picks\n|\nSponsored\nSurrey man charged in allegedly trafficking over 400 catalytic converters\nBlack Press Media\nB.C. man killed in motorcycle crash in Washington State\nBlack Press Media\nScatter Soap in Your Yard, Here's Why\nLifeHackGuru\n|\nSponsored\nStudent Discovers Genius Device to Wipe Out Mosquitoes Instantly\nTop Review Picks\n|\nSponsored\nUse This and Never Have to Change Your Whipper Snipper Line Again\nUltraCut\n|\nSponsored\nJudge quashes B.C. dad's refusal to get his daughter vaccinated against HPV\nBlack Press Media\nAbbotsford trustees vote against required parental consent for pronoun changes\nBlack Press Media\nYOUR VOTE MATTERS\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nWhat do you think is the most critical challenge facing the youth today?\n Mental health\n Education and employment opportunities\n Social media influence\n Peer pressure and bullying\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nTODAY IN B.C.\nEnvironment Canada issues multiple warnings as B.C. braces for weekend heat\nVIDEO: Cherry season in the pits for the Okanagan\n2 killed in West Vancouver head-on were international students: police\nConservatives have more money than rivals, spent far more on ads\nAccidental firefighting foam spill leads to disaster in Abbotsford creek \nMore from Today In BC >\n \nPeace Arch News\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nAdvertising\nSupport Centre\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nJoin our Team\nNews\nLocal News\nNewsletters\nSubscribe\nToday in BC\nCanadian News\nWorld News\nEntertainment\nSports\nBusiness\nTrending Now\nOpinion\nSubmit News Tips\nNeighbours\nCloverdale Reporter\nSurrey Now Leader\nNorth Delta Reporter\nAldergrove Star\nLangley Advance Times\nMaple Ridge-Pitt Meadows News\nMore\nOur Community\nPublic Notices\nVideo\nPhoto Galleries\nTravel\nWest Coast Traveller\nCannabis\nToday's Home\nPodcasts\nFood\nLife\nContact Us\nContests\nPuzzles\nContests\nShop\nImpress Stories\nSavvy Shopper\nImpress TV\nAdd Your Business\nE-Editions\nClassifieds\nAll Classifieds\nBook a Print Ad\nAuto\nToday's Drive\nAuto Showcase\nJobs\nLocalWork\nJoin Our Team\nObituaries\nCelebrations of Life\nFuneral Care Services\nIn Memory\nPlace an Obituary\nGood News\nLocal Good News\nSocial Media\nWhite Rock Live\nToday in BC\nYoutube\nI love British Columbia\nI love Alberta\nI love Nunavut\nI love Yukon\nI love Northwest Territories\n\u00a9 2024 Peace Arch News and Black Press Media Publications Contact"},

It's so needed today.\u201d\n\nThe exhibit features 13 red dresses hanging from trees, created by the loved ones of 13 murdered and missing indigenous women from Western New York and Canada, like Jenkins' sister.\n\n\u201cThis meant a lot to be able to share my story and be able to work through the trauma by having my family member being murdered and going missing,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nIt's an important message for Western New Yorkers to understand, according to the exhibit's creator, because so much of the area's culture has been influenced by indigenous roots.\n\n\u201cI look at this, and it brings both Europeans, non-Indigenous and indigenous people together so that we can walk in the future together and strengthen our relations,\u201d Burnett said.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nRelated Articles\nUnknown Stories of WNY: Remembering the trial of Nancy Bowen and Lila Jimerson\nLocal groups react to leaked US Supreme Court draft on Roe v.

The artwork is part of that project.\n\nThe relationship between Indigenous communities and police can often be difficult, with improvements to accountability an important part of the Calls to Justice in Final Report on MMIWG, released in 2021.\n\nRivers said change within the police service takes time, but it\u2019s something they\u2019re to which they are committee.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cWe work hard to make ourselves better as a police service and we welcome the opportunity to learn,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cI think the ongoing partnerships with all the Indigenous organizations, especially the Friendship Centre, it just goes to show that we as a police service are trying to change and make things better.\u201d\n\nMeawasige said she hopes the new sculpture will provide an important visual reminder to the whole community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be very much available for everyone to see, day or night,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re just hoping that there\u2019s a better understanding of why the N\u2019Swakamok Native Friendship Centre and the Greater Sudbury Police have worked together to promote awareness and to continue to work so there\u2019ll be (fewer) murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls in our communities, not just in Sudbury, but all over Canada.\u201d\n\nThe Local Journalism Initiative is made possible through funding from the federal government.\n\nmjensen@postmedia.com\n\nTwitter: @mia_rjensen\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nLATEST NATIONAL STORIES\nNEWS NEAR NORTH BAY\nTHIS WEEK IN FLYERS"},

That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for me to continue our traditions and be able to share it with the next generations that follow.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMaddie explains, \u201cOur culture was suppressed for so many years, and it\u2019s not that it was a long time ago that this ended. It\u2019s still a consistent struggle for all of us, especially in regards to things like additions, our quality of life on reserves, the way we\u2019re treated in public, the systemic racism that a lot of us face every day. It\u2019s really hard because we struggle with so much, there\u2019s not always a lot of awareness as to what we as Indigenous people have to go through.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nShe explains that as an Indigenous woman there is a constant fear of being alone.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAfter knowing even what my relatives have gone through as Indigenous people I\u2019m scared that I\u2019ll become another part of that statistic of missing and murdered Indigenous women. I\u2019m scared to take public transit because I\u2019m scared that I\u2019ll end up like my sisters, my two-spirited family.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHowever, she has dreams after finishing high school. Maddie would like to work in the medical field.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI would like to be a nurse practitioner, but to start off I want to go into nursing.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSecond student\u00a0\n\nA second female a Indigenous Grade 10 student is 15-year-old Ayasha Jacobs.\u00a0\n\nShe goes to the Indigenous culture room \u201cfor the quietness and a place to work. I also get to do cultural activities like make my skirts, to bead and I\u2019m making a pair of moccasins. It\u2019s nice that they have all these activities for us since I didn\u2019t have them when I was younger.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAdvertisement 6\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nAyasha says she too has fears of being kidnapped.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI had an experience very close to\u2026 If I had said the wrong thing I probably wouldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d\u00a0\n\nShe was walking to her school bus stop on Serpent River First Nation and a man drove up beside her and asked some a few questions.\u00a0\n\n\u201cA couple of minutes later he was offering me money to get into his car; it happened in front of a store. The weird thing was it wasn\u2019t like it was the first time for him. It\u2019s like he was doing this for a while \u2013 (he offered) at least $500 in cash. I said no, he tried to get me in his car and then the bus pulled up, and he drove off,\u201d Ayasha explains.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since. There was a big investigation on it.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt was a very close situation for that happened to me. It still bugs me sometimes when I walk by there, I still think of it. Having cars stop by me is a constant fear of just getting grabbed and pulled into a car.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAdvertisement 7\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard that we, as women, cannot do somethings like walking around at night, or going into a city and being a little uncomfortable having someone just pass by you and try to touch you. There\u2019s always that constant fear and anxiety that lurk with it. You\u2019re not fully safe unless you\u2019re with someone.\u201d\u00a0\n\nShe says her siblings were born in a city, but she was born on Serpent River First Nation.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that I was born around my culture. My brothers were born in a city.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAyasha is starting to learn Ojibwe, and wants to delve more into it.\u00a0\n\nOn May 3, both Ayasha and Jenifer Brousseau had a painted red hand marks on their faces over their mouths.\u00a0\n\nBrouseau said the painted hand on the face \u201cis about our voices being silenced. It\u2019s about the abuse.\u00a0\n\nAdvertisement 8\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cThe red hand over the mouth has become a symbol of a growing MMIWG2S movement. It stands for all the missing sisters whose voices are not heard,\u201d she read.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThird student\u00a0\n\nThe third student is Sitertia Pelletier, who is in Grade 11.\u00a0\n\nSitertia explained why they wear red on Indigenous Red Dress Day.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn our culture it\u2019s believed that red is the only colour that spirits can see. Around this time we put up red dresses along the highway to bring the spirits of the relatives we lost back home.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSitertia, who grew up on the reserve, has been learning about her culture all her life. She is a \u2018fancy shawl\u2019 dancer at powwows.\u00a0\n\nSitertia also wrote an essay for her English class on how the federal government has done little for the Indigenous women and girls.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about how the Canadian government failed our missing and murdered sisters and relatives,\u201d said Sitertia.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy family has been affected by this specific issue, and I\u2019d like to spread awareness about it. It\u2019s really personal to me.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBrousseau adds they will soon be teaching self-defense available to all the young women in the school.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo, if ever we are in these situations we\u2019ll know how to defend ourselves.\u201d\u00a0\n\nPhoto by KEVIN McSHEFFREYAbout 40 Indigenous and non-Indigenous students at ELSS walked from the school to the Intersection of Hillside Drive North and Spine Road carrying signs to let the public know about Red Dress Day.\n\nPhoto by KEVIN McSHEFFREYThree female students at ELSS spoke about Red Dress Day to remember Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women, Girls and Two Spirit People.

The dress is the product of the collaborative embroidery of hundreds of artists around the world. Sitting at the center of the room, it invited viewers to walk around it, exploring its angles and details as a whole.\u00a0\n\nIts red fabric elegantly flowed onto the pedestal, displaying the intricate works of embroidery. The dress\u2019s measurements fit the average person by design, yet the dress felt larger than life. The creators of the Red Dress intended for its significance to surpass its physical form, conveying a larger global connection.\n\nThe Red Dress has journeyed through museums and galleries around the world since 2009, eventually arriving in the United States this year, including a stop in Pittsburgh. The exhibit at the Frick Museum will be on display until Jan. 28, and afterward will travel to the Fuller Craft Museum in Boston.\u00a0\n\nKirstie Macleod, the visionary of the project, sketched the idea of the dress on a napkin in a London cafe. It has since transformed into a collective embroidery project by women around the world, involving 380 embroiderers from 51 countries and spanning 14 years. Embroidering the dress offered a medium of expression for the artists to communicate their stories and identity. Many of the women who contributed to the project came from tragic backgrounds of war and poverty. Combining the individual embroidered pieces into a quilt-like construction, the dress symbolizes strength and unity across borders.\u00a0\n\nOne of the contributing embroiderers, Shirley Steenberg, represents her Indigenous heritage and Canadian identity through her stitching. Steenberg identifies as Inuvialuk, an Indigenous group in Canada who live along the coast of the Beaufort Sea. Her embroidery design on the dress took the shape of a medicine wheel, a symbol with a longstanding history among various Native American groups.\u00a0\n\nSteenberg wrote in her feature on the Red Dress website that, \u201c[The wheel] embodies the Four Directions (north, south, east and west), as well as Father Sky, Mother Earth, and Spirit Tree \u2014 all of which symbolize dimensions of health and the cycles of life.\u201d Steenberg\u2019s design also includes Canadian maple leaves and the words \u201cStrong and Free,\u201d quoted from the Canadian national anthem, to represent her country.\n\nAnother contributing artist, Ruriko Wyborn, said she represented family and Japanese culture in her design.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy grandfather had a kimono business, and so my design tried to express the detail, colors and familiar images that are associated with kimono designs in Japan,\u201d Wyborn said.\u00a0\n\nSeveral of the messages and symbols in the embroidery pieces focused on social and political advocacy. A group of refugee women from Kosovo called Sister Stitch collaborated to create a design of birds, symbolizing migration, resilience and hope. The women of Sister Stitch fled their homes during the war in Kosovo in the late 1990s. They have since returned to Kosovo and, through Sister Stitch, earn money to help rebuild the lives they were forced to leave behind. Erina Sheholli, the Sister Stitch coordinator, wrote about the message behind their contribution to the dress, which they titled \u201cBirds of Peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope that the message of those birds will spread all over the world. We deserve to live free as birds,\u201d Sheholli wrote.\n\nContributing embroiderer Nathalie Frost, from Wales, explained her belief in the power of embroidery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cCraft, especially stitching \u2014 so often associated with women \u2014 has been overlooked for so long. The Red Dress completely bypasses that notion,\u201d Frost said. \u201cThe experience will remain with me and hopefully send messages for future generations who are lucky enough to see and learn about the work.\u201d\n\nThe Red Dress exhibition has generated attention not only in the Pittsburgh region, but around the world, museum educator Susanne Wilkinson explained.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe community has responded very very positively. People are drawn to [The Frick] to see the Red Dress,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cWe actually just said goodbye to some visitors from Paris.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWilkinson says the piece\u2019s overarching message of global unity holds the most significance to her.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat I like about it is there\u2019s so much detailing in it \u2014 and then the story it tells about how people from all these different countries were able to put their thoughts and ideas together and have this magnificent piece that represents the world \u2014 and that\u2019s incredible,\u201d Wilkinson said.\n\nWilkinson explained that even though she has seen the dress countless times, she still finds herself continuing to learn from it and engage with its content in different ways. She encourages others to slow down and pause when viewing the work, allowing time to absorb the details of each message in the embroidery.\u00a0\n\n\u201cEach time I view the dress, I look at something else because there\u2019s so much to see,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cSome messages are subtle and some aren\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s all about looking.\u201d\n\nOne Frick attendee, Debra Kirchhof-Glazier, said the dress was enchanting. \u201cThere\u2019s no words to adequately describe it \u2026 even if you were to take a picture it wouldn\u2019t do justice to it,\u201d Kirchhof-Glazier said. \u201cAll of the intensive and emotional artisanship that went into it \u2026 I mean, it\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X\nEmail this Story\nPrint this Story\ndressembroideryfashion\nAbout the Contributor\nCasey Carter, Senior Staff Writer\nCasey Carter is a sophomore communications major with certificates in digital media and sustainability.

It\u2019s nice that they have all these activities for us since I didn\u2019t have them when I was younger.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAdvertisement 6\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nAyasha says she too has fears of being kidnapped.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI had an experience very close to\u2026 If I had said the wrong thing I probably wouldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d\u00a0\n\nShe was walking to her school bus stop on Serpent River First Nation and a man drove up beside her and asked some a few questions.\u00a0\n\n\u201cA couple of minutes later he was offering me money to get into his car; it happened in front of a store. The weird thing was it wasn\u2019t like it was the first time for him. It\u2019s like he was doing this for a while \u2013 (he offered) at least $500 in cash. I said no, he tried to get me in his car and then the bus pulled up, and he drove off,\u201d Ayasha explains.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since. There was a big investigation on it.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt was a very close situation for that happened to me. It still bugs me sometimes when I walk by there, I still think of it. Having cars stop by me is a constant fear of just getting grabbed and pulled into a car.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAdvertisement 7\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard that we, as women, cannot do somethings like walking around at night, or going into a city and being a little uncomfortable having someone just pass by you and try to touch you. There\u2019s always that constant fear and anxiety that lurk with it. You\u2019re not fully safe unless you\u2019re with someone.\u201d\u00a0\n\nShe says her siblings were born in a city, but she was born on Serpent River First Nation.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that I was born around my culture. My brothers were born in a city.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAyasha is starting to learn Ojibwe, and wants to delve more into it.\u00a0\n\nOn May 3, both Ayasha and Jenifer Brousseau had a painted red hand marks on their faces over their mouths.\u00a0\n\nBrouseau said the painted hand on the face \u201cis about our voices being silenced. It\u2019s about the abuse.\u00a0\n\nAdvertisement 8\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cThe red hand over the mouth has become a symbol of a growing MMIWG2S movement. It stands for all the missing sisters whose voices are not heard,\u201d she read.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThird student\u00a0\n\nThe third student is Sitertia Pelletier, who is in Grade 11.\u00a0\n\nSitertia explained why they wear red on Indigenous Red Dress Day.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn our culture it\u2019s believed that red is the only colour that spirits can see. Around this time we put up red dresses along the highway to bring the spirits of the relatives we lost back home.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSitertia, who grew up on the reserve, has been learning about her culture all her life. She is a \u2018fancy shawl\u2019 dancer at powwows.\u00a0\n\nSitertia also wrote an essay for her English class on how the federal government has done little for the Indigenous women and girls.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about how the Canadian government failed our missing and murdered sisters and relatives,\u201d said Sitertia.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy family has been affected by this specific issue, and I\u2019d like to spread awareness about it. It\u2019s really personal to me.\u201d\u00a0\n\nBrousseau adds they will soon be teaching self-defense available to all the young women in the school.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo, if ever we are in these situations we\u2019ll know how to defend ourselves.\u201d\u00a0\n\nPhoto by KEVIN McSHEFFREYAbout 40 Indigenous and non-Indigenous students at ELSS walked from the school to the Intersection of Hillside Drive North and Spine Road carrying signs to let the public know about Red Dress Day.\n\nPhoto by KEVIN McSHEFFREYThree female students at ELSS spoke about Red Dress Day to remember Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women, Girls and Two Spirit People.

That initiative is now before the Standing Committee on the Status of Women.\n\n\u201cWhile I can appreciate that creating a new government initiative takes time, I urge the members of the standing committee, the federal government, and politicians of all parties to prioritize the implementation of this vital resource,\u201d added Sagkeeng Anicinabe First Nation Chief E.J.

ANDREW LICHTENSTEIN/CORBIS VIA GETTY IMAGES\n\nSixteen years ago, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) opened an investigation surrounding nine women and girls who had gone missing or were found murdered along a desolate stretch of roadway in northern British Columbia. The effort was dubbed Project E-PANA, named for the goddess that the Inuit people of Canada believe cares for souls before they go to heaven or are reincarnated.\n\nThe number of women that the RCMP identified in its probe soon doubled, to 18, and to keep the numbers from climbing even higher, authorities placed criteria on who would be included on the list. They had to be women or girls, they had to be involved in high-risk activities like hitchhiking, and they had to be last seen \u2014 or their bodies found \u2014 within a mile or so of Highways 16, 97 or 5 in upper British Columbia.\n\nThe Highway of Tears, as the main throughway was dubbed, instantly became a symbol for unchecked violence against Indigenous women and girls in Canada. And it remains a symbol for the violence \u2014 and the many reasons behind it \u2014 that endures today.\n\nCanada's Route 16, which connects Prince George to Prince Rupert through the province of British Columbia, has been dubbed \"Highway of Tears\" because many First Nations women and girls have been murdered or disappeared from here.\nANDREW LICHTENSTEIN/ CORBIS VIA GETTY IMAGES\nContents\nWhat Is the Highway of Tears?\nGiving Names to the Victims\nGetting Legal Justice\nToday Along the Highway of Tears\nWhat Is the Highway of Tears?\n\nThe drive from Vancouver, B.C., (which is a little less than a three-hour ride from Seattle) to the city of Prince George in northern British Columbia takes nearly nine hours. From there, a western turn along Highway 16 to the port city of Prince Rupert is another eight hours.\n\nIt is that final 416-mile (718-kilometer) section of winding, mostly two-lane highway between those two cities \u2014 through mountain passes, dozens of tiny villages, countless lakes and a whole lot of wilderness \u2014 that has become known as the Highway of Tears.\n\nThe remoteness of the highway, coupled with the fact that it bisects so many remote Indigenous communities without access to adequate transportation \u2014 often used by young Indigenous women hitchhiking simply as a means of getting from one place to another along the long, lonely road \u2014 makes it a ripe ground for violence.\n\n\"It's very, very isolated. You can drive for 15 minutes and not see a car. There are rivers and mountains. It's very heavily forested,\" says Wayne Clary, a retired RCMP investigator who has been brought back to work on the E-PANA cases. \"It's interesting when we look at some of our murders along there and we think, 'Was this a traveler who came upon this girl and had the opportunity to do what he did, or a local person?' It's dark, and the winters are pretty severe.

She became the first of the 18 women identified by the RCMP in the E-PANA project.\n\nOver the next almost 40 years, 17 other women became victims along the highway. The last was 14-year-old Aielah Saric Auger of the Lheidli T'enneh First Nations community, near Prince George. Her almost-unrecognizable body was discovered on an embankment of Highway 16 in February 2006, eight days after she went missing.\n\nAt its zenith, more than 60 RCMP investigators worked the cases along the Highway of Tears. But now, more than 15 years after Auger's body was found, barely a handful of police are still actively involved. No one has been added to the list since Auger, in 2006. Project E-PANA now consists of 13 homicide investigations and five missing people's investigations.\n\nAll the files, officially, remain open. But Clary has been forthright in informing the victims' families that many of the cases may never be solved.\n\n\"We've had some success,\" Clary says, noting that DNA samples tied notorious serial killer\u00a0 Bobby Jack Fowler to 16-year-old Highway of Tears victim Colleen MacMillen, found dead along the Highway in 1974. Fowler, suspected in at least two other Highway of Tears cases, died in an Oregon prison in 2006, before the connection in the MacMillen case was solidified. In 2019, authorities also got a murder conviction in the case of Monica Jack. The 12-year-old girl went missing in 1978, but her remains weren't found until 1995. That ruling is under appeal.\n\n\"We had a couple of very strong suspects, but just don't have the evidence. And we've used everything in our toolkit that we can,\" Clary adds. \"I'd say we've probably ruled out a lot of bad guys, too.

They began the Highway of Tears Initiative to put into action 33 recommendations made in the 2006 Highway of Tears Symposium Recommendations Report.\n\nThe recommendations include measures like better transportation options, increased police patrols, the establishment of awareness and prevention programs among at-risk women and their families, a wide-ranging media campaign and emergency readiness plans.\n\nYet the violence against Indigenous women, all across Canada, continues. According to the Canadian Femicide Observatory for Justice and Accountability:\n\nBased on 15 years of Homicide Survey data (2001-2015), homicide rates for Indigenous women and girls were approximately six times higher (48.2 per million population) than rates for non-Indigenous women and girls (8.2 per million population). Other research suggests that Indigenous women are 12 times more likely to be murdered or missing than any other women in Canada and 16 times more likely than Caucasian women.\n\n\"It's far too common. Even just this year alone, we've had three former clients go missing, you know?\" says Elsie Wiebe, the Calls to Justice Coordinator with CSFS's Highway of Tears Initiative. \"Just how common it is for Indigenous women to go missing and be found dead, or not be found at all. It has a devastating impact.\"\n\nWhat still needs addressing, Wiebe and many other Indigenous peoples advocates say, are the underlying conditions that lead to the violence. A 2019 report from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls put it this way:\n\nColonial violence, as well as racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia against Indigenous women, girls, and , has become embedded in everyday life \u2014 whether this is through interpersonal forms of violence, through institutions like the health care system and the justice system, or in the laws, policies and structures of Canadian society. The result has been that many Indigenous people have grown up normalized to violence, while Canadian society shows an appalling apathy to addressing the issue. The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls finds that this amounts to genocide.\n\nProject E-PANA has been the highest-profile police investigation involving missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, yet it touches on only a tiny fraction of the problem. Reliable statistics are difficult to come by, but more than 2,000 Indigenous women and girls in Canada have been reported to have gone missing or been murdered in the past three decades.\n\nSome are poor or undereducated, victims of domestic violence, drug abusers or are otherwise struggling in a larger society in which they are too often viewed as outsiders in their own lands. But Wiebe says that kind of lazy descriptor is unfair and devalues the defining characteristics of Indigenous communities who have survived immeasurable oppression, racism and targeted violence.\n\n\"The women and girls we've lost along the Highway of Tears were stopped short in the middle of their goals, dreams, education or careers.

Medicine Hat College will be hosting its second annual day of awareness for missing and murdered Indigenous people on May 5.--NEWS FILE PHOTO\n\nasmith@medicinehatnews.com\n\nMedicine Hat College has announced its intent to host a National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People on May 5.\n\nIn partnership with several community organizations, this the second annual event surrounding this day, the college says in a press release. It will feature an Indigenous prayer, a one-kilometre awareness walk, a guest speaker and an honour song.\n\n\u201cWe need allies to help be a voice for Indigenous people as we can\u2019t do this alone,\u201d says Chasity Cairns, manager of Indigenous engagement and student support at MHC. \u201cBecoming involved helps show to the families that have been impacted that they are not alone, and their loved ones aren\u2019t forgotten.\u201d\n\nThe day began as Red Dress Day in 2010, but has since expanded to bring awareness to all the women, girls, two-spirit people and men who have gone missing or been murdered.\n\n\u201cWhen we have big events like these it brings our community together in the spirit of the cause, which can make a tragic event a place for connection and healing,\u201d adds Cairns. \u201cThis year, we also wanted to focus on how impacted families can find support in Medicine Hat so we will be having booths at the event for individuals that need support or want to know more.\u201d\n\nThe goal of the event is primarily to raise awareness, said Cairns, but also to help empower local groups in order to hopefully see some change.\n\n\u201cBasically, what\u2019s happening is Canada\u2019s Indigenous people are trying to create awareness, because there\u2019s families that have been impacted by this. And nobody is doing anything,\u201d said Cairns.\n\nShe added that many of the statistics that were initially shared on the topic have not significantly improved since information was first released.\n\n\u201cThere are students that have been impacted, who have family members who are missing or murdered, even in Medicine Hat,\u201d said Cairns. \u201cSo, when we think of that, what impact does that have on our community?\u201d\n\nWith these extended partnerships, the college hopes to bring the Indigenous organizations and non-Indigenous allies together for the day, to create conversations that will ultimately create support networks for those impacted.\n\nAttendees will be encouraged to wear red for the event, which will take place on campus from on campus from 2-4 p.m.\n\nShare this story:\n\n13\n-12\n\nComments are closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n Twitter\n Facebook\n Instagram\n YouTube\n Tumblr\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nArchive\nAbout Us\nThe Medicine Hat News\nOther Publications\nContact\nContact the Medicine Hat News\n\n922 Allowance Ave SE\nMedicine Hat, AB T1A 3G7\n\n[P] 403.527.1101\n[F] 403.528.5696\n\nContact\nPrint Advertising: 403.528.5659\nNational Advertising: 403.528.5766\nOnline Advertising: 403.528.5698\nClassifieds: 403.526.7653\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2024 The Medicine Hat News\nTerms and Conditions & Privacy policy\n\n"},

ANDREW LICHTENSTEIN/CORBIS VIA GETTY IMAGES\n\nSixteen years ago, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) opened an investigation surrounding nine women and girls who had gone missing or were found murdered along a desolate stretch of roadway in northern British Columbia. The effort was dubbed Project E-PANA, named for the goddess that the Inuit people of Canada believe cares for souls before they go to heaven or are reincarnated.\n\nThe number of women that the RCMP identified in its probe soon doubled, to 18, and to keep the numbers from climbing even higher, authorities placed criteria on who would be included on the list. They had to be women or girls, they had to be involved in high-risk activities like hitchhiking, and they had to be last seen \u2014 or their bodies found \u2014 within a mile or so of Highways 16, 97 or 5 in upper British Columbia.\n\nThe Highway of Tears, as the main throughway was dubbed, instantly became a symbol for unchecked violence against Indigenous women and girls in Canada. And it remains a symbol for the violence \u2014 and the many reasons behind it \u2014 that endures today.\n\nCanada's Route 16, which connects Prince George to Prince Rupert through the province of British Columbia, has been dubbed \"Highway of Tears\" because many First Nations women and girls have been murdered or disappeared from here.\nANDREW LICHTENSTEIN/ CORBIS VIA GETTY IMAGES\nContents\nWhat Is the Highway of Tears?\nGiving Names to the Victims\nGetting Legal Justice\nToday Along the Highway of Tears\nWhat Is the Highway of Tears?\n\nThe drive from Vancouver, B.C., (which is a little less than a three-hour ride from Seattle) to the city of Prince George in northern British Columbia takes nearly nine hours. From there, a western turn along Highway 16 to the port city of Prince Rupert is another eight hours.\n\nIt is that final 416-mile (718-kilometer) section of winding, mostly two-lane highway between those two cities \u2014 through mountain passes, dozens of tiny villages, countless lakes and a whole lot of wilderness \u2014 that has become known as the Highway of Tears.\n\nThe remoteness of the highway, coupled with the fact that it bisects so many remote Indigenous communities without access to adequate transportation \u2014 often used by young Indigenous women hitchhiking simply as a means of getting from one place to another along the long, lonely road \u2014 makes it a ripe ground for violence.\n\n\"It's very, very isolated. You can drive for 15 minutes and not see a car. There are rivers and mountains. It's very heavily forested,\" says Wayne Clary, a retired RCMP investigator who has been brought back to work on the E-PANA cases. \"It's interesting when we look at some of our murders along there and we think, 'Was this a traveler who came upon this girl and had the opportunity to do what he did, or a local person?'

Steven Wilhelm/Postmedia\n\nThe day holds high significance for Green-Gopher and her family, as her sister is on the list of missing and murdered Indigenous people.\n\n\u201cWe are still being murdered, being exploited, facing violence at alarming rates compared to non-Indigenous people in Canada,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnybody that has a significant loss in their family, you have to go through a grieving period,\u201d she said. \u201cFor my family, justice has never been found; however, we did have a healing ceremony on Tsuut\u2019ina Nation.\u201d\n\nWith different people in different stages of their healing journey, she said this event is meant to bring the healing to them.\n\n\u201cWe have dancers, singers, and an opportunity for families to just share what they need to share from their hearts.\u201d\n\nA performer drums at the Memorial Drive Field of Crosses for Red Ribbon Day in Calgary on Sunday, May 5, 2024.

All the dresses were donations by people from all around the country and from\u00a0different cultures.\n\nShe offered insight into what motivated her to begin the project in an interview\u00a0with\u00a0the portal Indigenous Foundations Arts:\n\nThe REDress Project was inspired by my work as a teacher in Opaskawayak Cree Nation, also known as The Pas, where Helen Betty Osborne was brutally murdered while walking home one night by two young men who were not charged or sentenced until years later. And by a group of 300 women in Colombia who had the courage to create a moving 4 hour performance piece to protest their missing and murdered loved ones in the main square in Bogota. By a female Aboriginal scholar at a Canadian Studies conference in Germany standing up to remind everyone of Canada\u2019s colonial past and present.\n\nDespite the staggering numbers of violence against Aboriginal women in Canada, many are still unaware of the ongoing\u00a0tragedy. Linda Nothing, who helped in organising the project's installation in Calgary, explained in an interview to Metro News:\n\nThe image itself can speak to a lot of people. If they aren\u2019t aware of the issue they are often shocked and surprised that it\u2019s happening in Canada because there is a lot of under education and miss-education about indigenous issues here.\n\nSee video of the project from 2011 below:\n\nThe REDress Project is currently\u00a0displayed at The Acadia University Art Gallery\u00a0until November 29.\u00a0You can follow the project's updates on its official\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page.\n\nCategories\nNorth AmericaCanada\nArts & CultureEthnicity & RaceHuman RightsIndigenousWomen & Gender\n\t\nWritten by\nElaine Rigas\n\t\nSupport our work\n\nGlobal Voices stands out as one of the earliest and strongest examples of how media committed to building community and defending human rights can positively influence how people experience events happening beyond their own communities and national borders.\n\nPlease consider making a donation to help us continue this work.\n\nDonate now\n\nRecent North America Stories\nIn Georgia, a series of legal amendments are putting the country's EU aspirations on hold\nGeorgia\u00a0 11 hours ago\nNiger: Boubacar Tour\u00e9 analyzes the withdrawal of US troops\nSub-Saharan Africa\u00a0 7 days ago\nDecolonization, the climate crisis, and improving media education in the Pacific\nOceania\u00a0 1 week ago\nMore \u00bb\nRecent stories\nA year after environmental protests rocked Azerbaijan's village of Soyudlu, it is business as usual\nAzerbaijan\u00a0 11 hours ago\nSix dishes that most represent Hong Kong\nEast Asia\u00a0 14 hours ago\nWaiting for Beryl in Jamaica\nCaribbean\u00a0 1 day ago\nStart the conversation\n\nAuthors, please log in \u00bb\n\n Name (required)\n\n Email (will not be published) (required)\n\n Website\n\n Subscribe to comments on this post via email\n\nGuidelines\nAll comments are reviewed by a moderator.

PHOTO BY BRONSON CARVER /Miner and News\nArticle content\n\nA competition being waged by local businesses recently took a turn for the worse after two local real estate companies added some culturally insensitive contributions to the mix.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe competition started when local radio station 89.5 The Lake challenged area businesses to put up signs jokingly slamming their competitors as a way to promote positive community engagement and a way to put smiles on peoples\u2019 faces during the pandemic.\n\nWednesday afternoon, Royal LePage Landry\u2019s for Real Estate Kenora waded into murky territory, posting their sign on Facebook that read \u201cA century ago the Royal\u2019s [sic] triumphed all over cabin country and settled in the northwest to call Kenora both home & cottage.\u201d Shortly after, Century 21 Northern Choice Realty Ltd. commented on the Facebook post, writing \u201cLove it!\u201d\n\nFollowing the backlash, both real estate companies issued apologies over Facebook. Royal LePage called their original post \u201cinsensitive\u201d and \u201ctasteless,\u201d adding that \u201cin no way did we intend to highlight or make light of the colonial past that continues to negatively affect First Nations peoples.\u201d Century 21 wrote \u201cwe understand the perspective of the post and how it was inappropriate,\u201d adding that they respect Treaty land and they are sorry to anyone who they have offended.\n\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nVarious Canadian federal party leaders have previously recognized that the conquest of Turtle Island \u2014 or North America \u2014 was oppressive and soul wounding toward Indigenous people. The events unfolded on May 5, which is Red Dress Day and the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG).\n\nAnishinaabeg lawyer from Treaty 3 and Kenora home-lander Danielle Morrison was one of many who became outraged by the posts. According to her, the posts erase the true history behind Treaty 3 and perpetuate a narrative that is white supremacist in nature and suggests Indigenous people are \u201cless than.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe characterization that these lands were triumphed is a false narrative,\u201d Morrison said over the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s a misrepresentation of our history. Settlers were welcomed into the territory. Treaty 3 took years of negotiation and the survival of settlers and Canada\u2019s ability to expand into the west relied on signing an agreement.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cThe understanding of that relationship was that it was about a sharing of the land. So, it\u2019s disappointing to see that a business would mischaracterize our history as us being conquered peoples. These are the exact views that have existed for decades in this community [that] feed into racism and racial tensions in Kenora because they don\u2019t see how it impacts Anishinaabe people.\u201d\n\nIndigenous community advocate and politician Tania Cameron also took serious issue with the posts, calling Royal LePage\u2019s contribution a \u201cpoor attempt\u201d at getting in on the fun that left her feeling offended.\n\n\u201cKenora is surrounded by 12 First Nations, and we were actually put into our little patches of land or Indian Reserves, and I don\u2019t think Kenora should gloss over that colonial past,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cMaking light of it was in poor taste.\u201d\n\nCameron added that she feels it is important for anyone and everyone to call out these things when they see them, and that hopefully, this can be a \u201cteaching moment\u201d for all.\n\n\u201cWe have to call it out,\u201d she said. \u201cWhoever put the sign together, whoever approved it, they learned a lesson today, and that\u2019s one good take away from it.\u201d\n\nReflecting on the apologies, Cameron said both companies are on the right track, but should also take further steps in healing, such as inviting an elder into their spaces to heal and educate.\n\nbcarver@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\nNEWS NEAR PORTAGE\nTHIS WEEK IN FLYERS"},

Citizen photo by Brent Braaten June 21 2016Brent Braaten, Photographer\n\nUnder the branches of a Cottonwood Kym Gouchie spoke of the surroundings that inspired her latest song - a chant that reflects a local woman's efforts to cleanse the Highway of Tears.\n\n\"It felt like it came from the trees, it felt like it came from the ground and it came from the sky and it just filled the drum and the voice filled the space I was walking it,\" said Gouchie as the National Aboriginal Day entertainment thrummed in the background.\n\nGouchie joined Brenda Wilson-John on the last leg of her long journey from Prince Rupert to Prince George along Highway 16. During one five-kilometre stretch, the Lheidli T'enneh singer brought her drum.\n\n\"All of my songs come from a place that is beyond my conscious level,\" she said.\n\nThrough the minute-long song, Gouchie chants on repeat: \"We are cleansing the Highway of Tears, as we walk, as we walk.\"\n\nIt started as an incantation on the road but the song came together Sunday on the river bank, where she sat with Wilson-John and the Khast'an Drummers, who also played the song.\n\n\"Fluidly it all came together,\" said Gouchie, adding it had special meaning that Wilson-John helped finalize the piece.\n\n\"We sat down and she said this was the song that came to me,\" recalled Wilson-John, who walked more than 700 kilometres in memory of her sister, Ramona Wilson. \"First it was just the chant. It was just amazing and I was like 'Yes, that's it.'\n\n\"It's very simple and right to the point and it is very powerful at the same time.\"\n\nThe song is exudes both sadness and strength.\n\n\"Right now it's a victory, it's a success, it's a celebration, it's National Aboriginal Day, but if we were to be singing this in any other situation it would have a much sadder tone to it,\" Gouchie said. \"Having (Wilson-John) walk on the stage in her little fluorescent vest, it was very emotional but it was also very empowering... It just shows how strong we are as a people and especially as women.\"\n\nMusic is the best medium to speak to that dichotomy, both to honour the missing and murdered and empower those who remain.\n\n\"It's universal,\" said Gouchie. \"It's like a smile.

Polytechnic honours Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls with red dress displays\n\nby MBC News | May 10, 2019 | Current News | 0 comments\n\nRed dress displays have been placed at four Saskatchewan Polytechnic campuses to honour Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\n\nA permanent display can be viewed at the Moose Jaw campus and displays were up from Saturday until Monday in Prince Albert, Saskatoon and Regina.\n\nIndigenous Strategy coordinator Deanna Speidel says the red dress concept was originally created by a Winnipeg-based M\u00e9tis artist.\n\n\u201cJamie Black started this initiative of displaying red dresses with her art installations,\u201d Speidel adds.\n\nThe displays were supported through Saskatchewan Polytechnic\u2019s Indigenous Strategy.\n\n\u201cSask Polytech\u2019s Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls red dress displays bring about awareness and attention to this important issue in our campus communities. These displays evoke presence through absence. The more people are talking about missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, the less we will forget. I hope that there is room for dialogue to create that space to bring about public attention to this very serious issue,\u201d said Speidel.\n\n(Photo courtesy of Saskatchewan Polytechnic.)\n\n\u00a9 Missinipi Broadcasting Corporation | Site Design by Answers IT Consulting | Powered by WordPress"},

(Lisa Schick/980 CJME)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gallery at the Saskatchewan Legislative Building was filled with women wearing red and ribbon skirts Thursday morning.\n\nThey were there to push the government for action on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People \u2014 and they got it, in a way.\n\nGwenda Yuzicappi speaks on Red Dress Day about her late daughter Amber Redman and the need for action on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit Peoples on May 5, 2022. (Lisa Schick/980 CJME)\n\nIn an emergency debate, the Assembly voted unanimously to pass and adopt the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations\u2019 Declaration to Honour Indigenous Women and Girls.\n\nAhead of the proceedings, the women and leaders gathered to share their stories.\n\n\u201cMy daughter was only 19 years old when she was taken. It took two years and 10 months for us to find her remains and we only found 42 per cent of her remains,\u201d said Gwenda Yuzicappi, her voice full of emotion.\n\nYuzicappi\u2019s daughter was Amber Redman.\n\n\u201cTwo years and 10 months not knowing where your daughter is? That\u2019s a lot of pain, that\u2019s a lot of emotions \u2014 depression, (thoughts of) suicide. I went through so many emotions, it was very, very hard (and) difficult,\u201d explained Yuzicappi.\n\nLoretta Henderson\u2019s daughter, Krista Kenny, went missing in May 2009 and was found dead a few days later.\n\n\u201cShe was kind, she was loving (and) she helped out so many people,\u201d Henderson said of her daughter. \u201cEven though it was 13 years ago, it\u2019s still so hard. Every day we talk about her (and) always mention her because she was my only daughter.\u201d\n\nLoretta Henderson holds a picture of her late daughter, Krista Kenny, and talks about her and her disappearance on Red Dress Day at the Legislative Building on May 5, 2022. (Lisa Schick/980 CJME)\n\nJoyce Keepness is Tamara Keepness\u2019 grandmother; the five-year-old went missing without a trace in 2004.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that you never forget; it stays with you. Every day there\u2019s something that comes up that reminds you that this little person was never found. This little person, are we ever going to find her? Is she out there?\u201d Joyce Keepness said.\n\nLooking at the women around her, Keepness said she was glad to see the gathering and was proud of the leadership for putting together the show of support on Red Dress Day.\n\nFSIN Vice-Chief Aly Bear stood tall in her headdress and ribbon skirt in front of the other women, her voice full of purpose.\n\n\u201cWe have women going missing every day and it\u2019s not taken seriously,\u201d Bear said.\n\nBear said they were standing in solidarity with all the families of those missing and murdered and what they\u2019re going through. She said they were at the legislature to support and uplift the families, but also to push for the adoption of the declaration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to continue to stand up and let you know that we are still here, and we\u2019re here to continue to protect each other and we want you to stand with us as well in solidarity,\u201d said Bear.\n\nBear said the conversation needs to continue longer than just one day, that talking about the problem is the only way to find solutions to it.\n\n\u201cEvery day is Red Dress Day. We Indigenous women endure disproportionate levels of violence that are affected far too often by government\u2019s failure to act, a failure to intervene, a failure to stand up for those who need it most,\u201d said Betty Nippi-Albright, the NDP\u2019s critic for Indigenous issues.\n\nNippi-Albright said if communities keep losing Indigenous women to murder and disappearances, they\u2019re losing a very important member of society.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to Indigenous women, we don\u2019t get the attention that non-Indigenous women get when we go missing, or when we go murdered. And we need to change that and it changes by imploring our elected officials to act and stop giving lip service,\u201d said Nippi-Albright.\n\nThe declaration\n\nThe Saskatchewan Party and NDP voted in favour of adopting the FSIN\u2019s declaration, which consists of five articles.\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations and its governing and organizational structures will take responsibility and action to address the disproportionate victimization of Indigenous women and girls.\n\n\u2014 \u201cIn matters of governance and politics, Indigenous women have the right to participate at all levels of governance, including the Nation, tribal council, provincial and national levels, free from discrimination, physical, verbal, spiritual or emotional abuse and harassment, and with respect for both individual autonomy and democratic principles.\n\n\u2014 \u201cIndigenous women and girls have the right to partake in ceremonial practices, access safe and accessible childcare, education, health, recreation, resource stewardship, economic development, land protection and livelihood activities with full consideration for their important roles and responsibilities as life-givers of our Nations, free from disparagement, racism, sexual innuendo, harassment or assault; and with reasonable expectations of physical, mental, spiritual and emotional safety.\n\n\u2014 \u201cIndigenous women and girls have the right to physical, mental, emotional and spiritual protection. It is incumbent upon all persons to ensure the safety of women and girls.\n\n\u2014 \u201cIndigenous women and girls have the right to access independent and culturally relevant and safe processes to investigate and meaningfully address any and all complaints of gender-based violence. Indigenous women and girls who experience gender-based violence have the right to redress and accountability from those responsible.\u201d\n\nDuring the emergency debate, Don Morgan \u2014 the minister responsible for First Nations, Metis and Northern Affairs \u2014 said there was nothing in those five articles a person could disagree with. He talked about the government\u2019s commitment to lessening violence against everyone in the province, including Indigenous women and girls.\n\nIn her remarks during debate, Nippi-Albright talked about past action from the government on such issues.\n\n\u201cThis government has sent the message to us as Indigenous women (that) they do not care. This government does not care,\u201d said Nippi-Albright.\n\nAnd the NDP critic talked about needing the government to not just give lip service to this issue and asked whether there would be clear reporting on measurements of success.\n\n\u201cOr is it just a document you\u2019re going to say, \u2018Yeah, we approved it. We put it on the website\u2019?\u201d Nippi-Albright said as she slammed her hand down on the desk. \u201cAnd remember, not all Indigenous people have access to internet.\u201d\n\nAmong actions requested were for the government to adopt the 231 recommendations from the National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, and to offer more support to relevant community-based organizations.\n\nDiscover more on CJME.com\nRegina man arrested, charged after two people attacked with knife at yard sale\n6h ago\n 1.6K Views\nFunnel cloud advisories issued for east-central Saskatchewan\n3h ago\n 708 Views\nSTF, gov't still working to find a teachers' contract arbitrator\n23h ago\n 672 Views\nSask gov't funds garnished over carbon tax dispute, justice minister says\n2h ago\n 610 Views\nSask.

As we know I\u2019ll be on a mission next week,\u201d Moe said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that one way or another.\u201d\n\nMoe said it is \u201chighly likely\u201d the minister attends the community, and that he has asked Carrot River Valley MLA Fred Bradshaw, the representative of the area, to reach out as well.\n\n\u201cThis is a very serious situation, this is a five-year-old boy, and the family asked, and the chief asked, and my response was yes, and I think that\u2019s what the premier should say as well,\u201d Meili said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we need from our leaders, is to come and see the reality of the struggles people are facing.\u201d\n\nAs of Wednesday, a 92-square-kilometre area has been covered, as RCMP and volunteers search the area around the community.\n\nYoung was last seen around noon on April 19, although he may have been spotted at a local playground around 2:30 p.m., according to police.\n\nAbduction is not suspected and his disappearance does not meet the criteria for an Amber Alert.\n\nMoe said he understands one of the concerns the community has is surrounding the lack of an Amber Alert.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s an Indigenous Amber Alert, or whether its enhancements to the Amber Alert that we have, that may be a conversation our minister could have with the RCMP potentially, as there\u2019s other entities at this table,\u201d Moe said.\n\n\u201cAnytime there\u2019s opportunities for us to enhance some of the procedures around missing children, most notably on today May 5, Red Dress Day, it\u2019s worth a discussion.\u201d\n\nThe search for Frank Young entered its 17th day on Thursday. RCMP said it would be focusing on water searches in the Carrot River over the next few days.\n\nRed Earth Cree Nation is located approximately 224 kilometres east of Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nRELATED IMAGES\n1 / 1\nSaskatchewan Premier Scott Moe spoke with reporters at the Legislative Building on May 5, 2022.\nReport an error\nEditorial standards & policies\nWhy you can trust CTV News\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nMUST WATCH\n\nPet chicken from B.C. is now a Guinness World Record holder\n\nOnt. woman says black widow spider was inside bag of grapes\n\nThis Calgary man is trying to climb 21 mountains in 21 days\n\nCarjacking suspect swerves into traffic in police chase\n\nVibrant cascade of lava spews from Italy's Mount Etna\n\n'Oh my god!': Shocking brawl on a golf course in B.C.\n\nCalgary man wins massive $66M Lotto 6-49 jackpot\n\nToronto traffic so bad Niall Horan walks to his show\n\nWATCH: Ohio officer goes on hunt to find formula for newborn\n\nHow a MLB shortstop ended up with a top hit on iTunes\n\nRescuers searching for entangled whale near Vancouver Island\n\nREGINA TOP STORIES\nSask. files injunction in light of federal carbon tax dispute\nRegina man charged with attempted murder following assault at garage sale\nAll Co-op cardlock locations across Western Canada back online in light of cybersecurity incident\nSaskPower opens first battery energy storage facility outside Regina\nSask. school divisions struggle with financial pressures despite 'record' education budget\nGreg Fertuck to be sentenced Thursday\nB.C. man arrested in drug trafficking investigation in Regina\nNathan's hot dog eating contest: Bertoletti eats 58 hot dogs to claim Mustard Belt, Sudo wins 10th women's title\nTOP VIDEOS\n\nPet chicken from B.C. is now a Guinness World Record holder\n\nSask. couple discovers litter of skunks\n\nShea Patterson looking to lead Riders to victory\n\nSunwing and Regina couple in legal battle\n\nAnother mixed bag of weather conditions\n\nMontreal Lake Cree Nation without running water\n\nMany school divisions reporting deficits\n\nSaskPower opens battery energy storage facility\n\nCanada-wide warrant issued for homicide suspect\n\nSkunk litter discovered in Sask. yard\n\nMeet the first eliminated team from Amazing Race Canada\n\nRegina Urgent Care Centre open for business\n\nMore precipitation on the horizon\n\nPolice search for suspect in violent assault\n\nHurricane Beryl approaches Mexico after sweeping Caribbean\n\nCTVNEWS.CA TOP STORIES\nUPDATED\nBritain's Labour on track for huge majority, exit poll suggests, amid frustration with Conservatives\n\nBritain\u2019s Labour Party was headed for a huge majority in Britain\u2019s election on Thursday, an exit poll suggested, against a gloomy backdrop of economic malaise, mounting distrust in institutions and a fraying social fabric.\n\n16 min ago\n\nTrying to sell or buy a home this summer?

Ten months later, her body was found, adding her name to the list of 18 women since 1969 who have been killed or went missing along that same stretch of Highway 16 from Prince Rupert to Prince George \u2014 commonly referred to as the \u201cHighway of Tears.\u201d\n\nTo this day, Wilson\u2019s family is far from solving her murder, but Teegee says they\u2019re not the only ones left with a lack of closure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d definitely still like to find out what happened,\u201d she says, \u201cbut we can\u2019t forget the other families where they haven\u2019t found the remains of their loved ones. There\u2019s still a threat out there, and we can\u2019t forget that.\u201d\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\nA long-called-for transit service will hopefully bring an end to that era of death and sadness. BC Transit has announced two new bus routes that will connect Smithers to Prince George will begin service on Monday, using Burns Lake as a central hub.\n\nThe daily email you need for Edmonton's top news stories.\n\nThe service comes 11 years after\u00a0the Highway of Tears Symposium Recommendations Report, a list of 33 recommendations for improving safety along the highway and for the First Nations communities it passes through. The provincial government announced last year it was committing $6.4 million over three years to a Highway 16 transportation plan, which will eventually see bus service extend throughout the 750-kilometre highway.\n\nREAD MORE:\u00a0B.C. announces bus service for Highway of Tears\n\nMORE ON BC\n2 prominent B.C.

BC Transit says that service has seen daily use by passengers.\n\nFor Teegee, the service is a welcome announcement that she hopes will bring more safety and security to families in the community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a personal victory for our family, as well as for everybody else,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we could prevent even one young girl\u2019s life [from being taken], it\u2019s worth the fight and worth the struggle to get to this day.\u201d\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut she adds that the fight for more modern services and a safer community is far from being won.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other recommendations [in the report] that really need to be looked into and funded, as [the previous] government has committed to,\u201d Teegee said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of work to be done around victims support, a relationship with the RCMP, and I think there\u2019s still [a need for] boots-on-the-ground emergency preparedness \u2014 all of those pieces of work that cannot be overlooked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken 11 years for us to get here, so how many years more is it going to take?\u201d\n\nWith files from Kristen Robinson\n\nJOURNALISTIC STANDARDS\nCOMMENT\nREPORT AN ERROR\n\u00a9 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.\nSponsored content\nMore to Explore\nADVERTISEMENT\n630 CHED Afternoons with Bryn Griffiths & Reid Wilkins\n2:00 PM - 5:00 PM\n630CHED\nTrending\nGreece is bringing in a 6-day work week.

Now, a hot ragtop variant is on its way to Canada for the 2025 model year.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nCalled the Mercedes-AMG CLE 53 Cabriolet, it deploys a 3.0L inline six-cylinder engine working in tandem with a 48-volt mild hybrid system to produce 443 horsepower and 413 lb-ft of torque, though drivers can briefly draw upon 443 lb-ft of twist via an overboost function if they\u2019re attempting to impress the person sitting next to them. The nine-speed transmission has been fettled by AMG and 4Matic+ all-wheel drive is part of the deal as is rear-axle steering which can yaw up to 2.5 degrees. Track is increased by 2.3 inches up front and 3.0 inches at the rear compared to an equivalent non-AMG model.

I mean, you can, but expect to be called out on it by anyone with even more than a passing knowledge about Mercedes powertrains. The ISG is there to assist at lower speeds and help make turbo lag a thing of the past.\n\nAs one would expect, the AMG CLE 53 Cabriolet has numerous AMG-specific design cues peppering its exterior, including a grille which would look right at home on the Daddy Warbucks SL convertible plus two strakes on the hood which give an impression the inline-six is trying to claw its way out of the engine bay. An optional Performance Studio package adds items such as a high-gloss black spoiler lip on the trunk lid and a rear diffuser panel between tailpipe trims, while various Night packages darken the brightwork to specific tastes.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nToggle full screen mode\nPrevious Gallery Image\nPhoto by Mercedes-AMG\nPhoto by Mercedes-AMG\nPhoto by Mercedes-AMG\nPhoto by Mercedes-AMG\nPhoto by Mercedes-AMG\nPhoto by Mercedes-AMG\nPhoto by Mercedes-AMG\nPhoto by Mercedes-AMG\nPhoto by Mercedes-AMG\nPhoto by Mercedes-AMG\nPhoto by Mercedes-AMG\nPhoto by Mercedes-AMG\nNext Gallery Image\nToggle gallery captions\nView All 12 Photos\n\n1 of 12\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nIts interior has the Mercedes trappings one would expect in a tri-star cabriolet, including the trick Airscarf technology (yes, that feature actually works well). A 12.3-inch screen serves as a gauge cluster while a portrait-oriented 11.9-inch tablet sits in the centre and is slightly canted towards the driver. The tilt of the central display can be electrically adjusted from 15 to 40 degrees to prevent reflections caused by sunlight when the soft top is open. Again, this is a feature we\u2019ve sampled in the two-seat SL and it is remarkable the difference it makes to one\u2019s experience when the top is down. There\u2019s about 10 cubic feet of cargo space when the roof is lowered, so pack lightly, though the rear seats are 60/40 split folding.\n\nAdvertisement 6\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nRECOMMENDED FROM EDITORIAL\n2024 Mercedes-Benz CLE 300 Cabriolet, Mercedes-AMG CLE 53 straddle performance and daily-use\nCar Review: 2023 Mercedes-AMG C 43 4Matic\n\nStandard seats can be clad microfiber upholstery or a leather which is allegedly treated with some sort of coating to reduce surface temps by up to 53 degrees Fahrenheit compared to untreated leather. This helps when cruising with the top down in Arizona. Optional AMG performance seats have more pronounced bolsters in case you select one of the more aggressive driving modes on tap through the infotainment system, some of which are optional in an AMG Dynamic Plus package (because Mercedes). \u00a0\n\nThe roarty 2025 AMG CLE 53 Cabriolet will arrive at Canadian dealerships in 2025.\n\nSign up for our newsletter Blind-Spot Monitor and follow our social channels on Instagram ,Facebook and X to stay up to date on the latest automotive news, reviews, car culture, and vehicle shopping advice.\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nStop Buying Lottery Tickets & Start Doing This Instead!\nYukon\n|\nSponsored\nClick Here\nCops hunt for suspect after child sexually assaulted\nWinnipeg Sun\nManitoba RCMP shoot and kill man who was allegedly assaulting a woman\nWinnipeg Sun\nCasinos Hate You Doing This.

In many cases, they died at the hands of someone they knew. To the women, girls and families who have been harmed, have faced loss and grief, and who may be at risk, please know you are not alone.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Government of Canada Justice Research and Data page, between 1980 and 2014, there were 6,849 police-reported female homicide cases in Canada. Among the total number of female victims, 16 per cent were Indigenous women.\n\n\nphotos@comoxvalleyrecord.com\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n\nAbout the Author: Erin Haluschak\n\nErin Haluschak is a journalist with the Comox Valley Record since 2008.

(Derek Craddock/paNOW Staff)\nBy paNOW Staff\nRED DRESS DAY\n\u2018More that needs to be done\u2019: P.A. to mark Red Dress Day with solemn ceremony\nMay 4, 2024 | 12:00 PM\n\n\n\nFor more than two decades, Canadians have been coming together to remember Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\n\nOn Sunday, during Red Dress Day, community members and special guests will carry on that tradition in Prince Albert.\n\nThe event will run from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. at the Sisters In Spirit monument on the riverbank in downtown P.A.\n\nThe program will include drumming performances, poignant speeches, and a chance to reflect as a community. Due to trouble receiving a permit, a walk will not take place.\n\nDespite this, the Director of Health and Social Development with the Prince Albert Grand Council (PAGC), Shirley Woods anticipates many people will come.\n\nWoods said the main objective of holding this event is to continue to raise awareness and provide education on the issue and the challenges faced by families daily.\n\nRed Dress Day was first commemorated in 2010, to pay respect to the victims, and call on all levels of government to take action to address the racialized and gendered violence inflicted on Indigenous peoples.\n\nIn 2019, the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls released its final report, stating that \u201cpersistent and deliberate human and Indigenous rights violations and abuses are the root cause behind Canada\u2019s staggering rates of violence against Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA people.\u201d\n\nFrom that report, 231 Calls for Justice were given to governments, police, and public services to draw attention to and end violence against Indigenous women.\n\nWhen asked if she believes the message around MMIWG is still being heard, Woods said yes, but more needs to be done.\n\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s definitely an increased awareness amongst people about some of the challenges that are faced for women and for the families involved,\u201d she said. \u201cI still think there\u2019s a lot more that needs to be done.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\npanews@pattisonmedia.com\n\nby paNOW Staff\nAround the Web\nAll Canadians Aged 40-80 May Qualify for This $250,000 Tax-free Life Benefit\nDollarGuardian\nWrinkles in the Mouth in Old Age: This Ancient Remedy Helps\nNeotonics\nEdmonton: Unsold 2023 Suvs Are on Sale (Take a Look at Prices)\nSUV | Search ads\nRemember Tiger Woods' Ex-wife?

Established last year, the group in Terrace is open to teenagers between 11 to 18 years old and is the second YVC group in Canada.\n\nCurrent plans for the memorial include a sunken garden and totem-pole monument, which will be maintained by YVC and Volunteer Terrace after its completion. Through conversations with advocates and families affected by the crisis, the teenagers said they understood the importance of giving the community a permanent place to honour the missing and murdered.\n\n\u201cThis is the first big project that we want to focus on for years to come,\u201d Lecky said.\n\n\u201cAll the people that have been affected by it now, in the past and in the future, it will be here for a long time and will serve as a reminder for all the people who have been lost.\u201d\n\nThe group had their first meeting for the project on June 1, in which the Kermode Friendship Centre, Terrace RCMP and the BC Government and Service Employees\u2019 Union (BCGEU) were present. The memorial has also gained support from the National Inquiry for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and MP Nathan Cullen, with verbal support from the City of Terrace.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of [YVC] is really to get the youth involved with the community and to learn, not just about volunteering, but how to interact with organizations,\u201d Lecky said, who also wrote a grant on behalf of YVC to help fund the memorial.\n\nWhile the location is still undetermined, the teenagers have been working diligently to find the memorial a home. The sunken garden and monument might be placed on available city-owned land, but nothing has been committed yet, according to 19-year old Hazel McDaniel, YVC team leader.\n\n\u201cCity property in front of the superstore next to Kondolas Furniture is what has been discussed,\u201d McDaniel said.\n\nFirst fundraiser\n\nCanadian filmmaker Matt Smiley also donated a screening of his award-winning documentary Highway of Tears for the memorial\u2019s first fundraiser on June 9 at the REM Lee Theatre, followed with a panel discussion.\n\nOn the panel was local advocate Gladys Radek, who\u2019s niece Tamara Chipman remains missing after 13-years, former BC Liberal candidate for the Stikine riding Wanda Good, who has been an advocate for 20 years after the disappearance of her cousin Lana Derrick, and Doug Leslie, father to 15-year-old Loren Leslie, whose body was found eight years ago in Vanderhoof, B.C.\n\nWhile there were fewer than 20 people in attendance, YVC members voiced their questions to the panel to gain a better understanding of the crisis.\n\n\u201cI thought it was wonderful, I was really, really happy with the way that it went,\u201d McDaniel said of the fundraising event. \u201cI thought the panel discussion was excellent, appropriate and respectful.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, YVC member Elijah Stephens, 18, introduced the music video for The Highway, a ballad he helped write last year with seven other students from \u2018Na Aksa Gyilak\u2019yoo School in Kitsumkalum First Nation.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Terrace YVC will be reaching out to northwest First Nations communities and organizations like the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada to make sure they are aware and kept in the loop about the project.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a really big deal, not only for Terrace but for B.C. and hopefully for Canada as a whole to really have a monument to recognize what\u2019s happened,\u201d McDaniel said.\n\n\u201cThis affects so many people in the north, and we want our whole process to emulate the seriousness of it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nbrittany@terracestandard.com\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter\n\nGrace Davidson, Grace-Ella Beckley and Cameron Beauchamp listen to discussions about the memorial project during YVC\u2019s second meeting on June 6 at Volunteer Terrace.

The grounds were decorated with hand-crafted paper lanterns and painted rocks, representing over 1,000 murdered and missing girls and women.\n\nAmong the crowd were Ryerson students from the Centre for Women and Trans People. Jessica Ketwaroo-Green, a fourth year politics and governance students carried a hand-made banner along with some of her classmates in support of the vigil.\n\n\u201cThis is an issue that is really prevalent in Canada and unfortunately not a lot of people speak about it or speak to it. So if I can come out and show my support and show my solidarity I think it can go a long way,\u201d said Ketwaroo-Green.\n\nThe vigil featured performances of dancing, drumming and singing. There were also guest speakers from the indigenous community. One of the speakers was Cyndy Baskin an associate professor of social work at Ryerson and chair of Ryerson\u2019s Aboriginal Education Council.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the stories, it\u2019s the truths of all these families that need to be told in many different ways before any of us will be able to reconcile,\u201d said Baskin.\n\nThe vigil had a large impact on Calvin Brook, co-founder of Brook Mcllroy architecture firm, who has been working closely with the Native Women\u2019s Resource Centre of Toronto. It was the first Sisters in Spirit Vigil he\u2019s attended, but certainly won\u2019t be his last\n\n\u201cTo me it\u2019s the most important unresolved issue in Canadian society and non-indigenous people have to fix it, it\u2019s not up to Indigenous people to fix it. So I\u2019m trying to find ways to be part of that solution,\u201d said Brook.\n\nSHARE THIS:\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick

The vigils seek to honour missing and murdered Aboriginal women, support grieving families and create a movement for social change. Residents of Agassiz, Harrison and surrounding areas are invited to gather for the fourth local Sisters in Spirit Vigil held at the Agassiz United Church on Oct. 4 at 7 p.m. (Unsplash)\n\nA local social change group is preparing for the Sisters in Spirit Vigil at 7 p.m. Oct. 4 at the Agassiz United Church.\n\nThis is the fourth year the candle-lit vigil has been put on by the group as part of a national movement run by the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada (NWAC) to honour missing and murdered Aboriginal women, support grieving families and provide opportunities for healing.\n\nOrganizer Debbie Hansen says she wants the vigil to help people learn what the movement is all about. Using NWAC materials and speaking notes, Hansen hopes the event will encourage participants to acknowledge, support and learn from one another.\n\n\u201cThis is a Canada-wide movement, and we\u2019re one little small piece in this one small corner of the world that also cares,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to establish a venue where people can know about this\u2026and show their empathy and learn about whats happened to the Indigenous cultures.\u201d\n\nREAD: Agassiz book study aims for discussion and education\n\nBecause the movement is national, the local Wrongs to Rights church group will focus their bi-monthly meeting on missing and murdered Aboriginal women and the national inquiry. On Oct. 4 from 1-3 p.m., the All Saints Anglican Church is open to anybody who wants to join the discussion. The talk will be followed by a 5 p.m. potluck dinner at the Agassiz United Church before the beginning of the Sisters in Spirit Vigil at 7 p.m.\n\nAfter an introductory activity, each participant is given a candle to walk out with. At the end, participants extinguish their candles and walk out in silence.\n\n\u201cUsually we highlight five or six of the missing women and talk about their lives,\u201d says Hansen. \u201cWho were they as people?\u201d\n\nAccording to NWAC\u2019s 2010 statistics, the number of missing and murdered Aboriginal woman and girls \u2013 First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit \u2013 is disproportionately high. Between 2000 and 2008, Aboriginal women and girls represented approximately 10 per cent of female homicides in Canada, yet Aboriginal women make up only three per cent of the Canadian population altogether.\n\nBringing the issue even closer to home is the fact that a majority of cases occur in Western provinces, with 28 per cent happening in B.C.\n\nREAD: First Nations have high hopes for B.C. New Democrats\n\n\u201cWe have got to try to make it better,\u201d says Hansen. \u201cThe only way you can get reconciliation is for the truth to come out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to share information, support people as they go through a tough time and be part of a movement for social change in a positive way,\u201d she adds.\n\nThe Oct. 4 Wrongs to Rights study group, United Church potluck and Sisters in Spirit vigil are open to the public.\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tAgassiz community orchard takes root\n\t\t4-vehicle crash snarls Hwy. 1 traffic at Chilliwack-Abbotsford border\n\t\tUPDATE: Traffic flowing again after crash on Hwy. 1 near Agassiz\n\t\tMaple Ridge Walmart closed by teen stabbing on Canada Day\n\t\tWoman in police custody after shots fired in Laidlaw near Hope\nFacebook Comments (0) \nYOUR VOTE MATTERS\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nWhat do you think is the most critical challenge facing the youth today?\n Mental health\n Education and employment opportunities\n Social media influence\n Peer pressure and bullying\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nTODAY IN B.C.\nEnvironment Canada issues multiple warnings as B.C. braces for weekend heat\nVIDEO: Cherry season in the pits for the Okanagan\n2 killed in West Vancouver head-on were international students: police\nConservatives have more money than rivals, spent far more on ads\nAccidental firefighting foam spill leads to disaster in Abbotsford creek \nMore from Today In BC >\n \nAgassiz-Harrison Observer\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nAdvertising\nSupport Centre\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nJoin our Team\nNews\nLocal News\nNewsletters\nSubscribe\nToday in BC\nCanadian News\nWorld News\nEntertainment\nSports\nBusiness\nTrending Now\nOpinion\nSubmit News Tips\nNeighbours\nAbbotsford News\nChilliwack Progress\nMission City Record\nHope Standard\nMore\nOur Community\nPublic Notices\nVideo\nPhoto Galleries\nTravel\nWest Coast Traveller\nCannabis\nToday's Home\nPodcasts\nFood\nLife\nContact Us\nContests\nPuzzles\nContests\nShop\nImpress Stories\nSavvy Shopper\nImpress TV\nAdd Your Business\nE-Editions\nClassifieds\nAll Classifieds\nPost a Print Ad\nItems for Sale\nGarage Sales\nBook a Print Ad\nAuto\nToday's Drive\nAuto Showcase\nJobs\nLocalWork\nJoin Our Team\nObituaries\nCelebrations of Life\nFuneral Care Services\nIn Memory\nPlace an Obituary\nGood News\nLocal Good News\nSocial Media\nAgassiz-Harrison Live\nToday in BC\nYoutube\nI love British Columbia\nI love Alberta\nI love Nunavut\nI love Yukon\nI love Northwest Territories\n\u00a9 2024 Agassiz-Harrison Observer and Black Press Media Publications Contact"},

Short speeches are made, candles are lit, names are read aloud and a moment of silence honours the thousands lost.\n\nAs I do with most events in the community, I head out with my camera, microphone, cellphone and notebook, looking for the best vantage point in the room to get some good pictures and video.\n\nBut within minutes of arriving, my \u201creporter approach\u201d dissolves. I know the media is vital in sharing the stories of these women and bringing more attention to this ongoing national crisis, but as I sit there and listen to stories of loss and heartbreak, I can\u2019t help but to simply become another human being. Another woman.\n\nMy eyes filled with tears as I listened to the story of Terry Martin-Dauthanais, a mother of three who was murdered while in a relationship that her family described as violent and abusive. Her partner, who took custody of the children \u2013 refusing to allow Terry\u2019s parents to see them after her death\u2013 was a suspect, but was never arrested.\n\nBut according to the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada (NWAC), that\u2019s not all that unusual. More than half of the murder cases in NWAC\u2019s database remain unsolved, and only 53 per cent of murder cases involving Indigenous women and girls have led to homicide charges \u2013 a huge gap from Canada\u2019s 84 per cent homicide clearance rate.\n\nThe injustice of Terry\u2019s story wasn\u2019t just maddening, it was heartbreaking. And I realized that I was experiencing only a fraction of the pain and injustice experienced by the friends and family of women like Terry.\n\nWhile Terry\u2019s case remains unsolved, it\u2019s unlikely she was killed by a stranger. NWAC\u2019s database shows that 23 per cent of murders are committed by a current of former partner of the woman or girl.\n\nThat being said, Indigenous women are almost three times more likely to be killed by a stranger than non-Indigenous. And most cases occur here in Western Canada. More than a quarter (28 per cent) of NWAC\u2019s cases occurred in B.C. and 16 per cent in Alberta.\n\nWithout question, I stand in solidarity with Indigenous women, who continue to fight an incredible fight - asking the government and the RCMP for accountability and justice.\n\nI started attending Sisters in Spirit vigils as a reporter, but I will continue to attend them as an ally, as a woman and as a Canadian who is ready for change.\n\nLearn more about MMIWG at NWAC.ca.\n\nWatch a video about the Agassiz United Church\u2019s 2018 Sisters in Spirit Vigil and hear from organizer Debbie Hansen online at agassizharrisonobserver.com.\n\n\u2013Nina Grossman, the Observer\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tAgassiz community orchard takes root\n\t\t4-vehicle crash snarls Hwy. 1 traffic at Chilliwack-Abbotsford border\n\t\tUPDATE: Traffic flowing again after crash on Hwy. 1 near Agassiz\n\t\tMaple Ridge Walmart closed by teen stabbing on Canada Day\n\t\tWoman in police custody after shots fired in Laidlaw near Hope\nFacebook Comments (0) \nInmate assaulted at Kent Institution\nBlack Press Media\nMan dies throwing candy during Alberta Canada Day parade\nBlack Press Media\nCanadians Born 1944-1983 Could Get This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nUnsold 2024-2025 Alaska Cruise Cabins May Be Cheaper Than You Think\nFavorite Searches\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\n4 Ways to Retire Comfortably With $500K in Canada\nFisher Investments Canada\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nRattlesnake 'loose in the community' reports Seabird Island band\nBlack Press Media\n4-vehicle crash snarls Hwy. 1 traffic at Chilliwack-Abbotsford border\nBlack Press Media\nCanadians Born 1944-1984 Could Apply For This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nThe Best Way To See Alaska Is By Cruise - Explore All-Inclusive Offers\nFavorite Searches\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nThese Unsold Alaska Cruise Cabin Deals Will Leave You Speechless (See Prices)\nFavorite Searches\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nVIDEO: Police incident evacuates Langley City apartment building\nBlack Press Media\nMaple Ridge Walmart closed by teen stabbing on Canada Day\nBlack Press Media\nYOUR VOTE MATTERS\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nWhat do you think is the most critical challenge facing the youth today?\n Mental health\n Education and employment opportunities\n Social media influence\n Peer pressure and bullying\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nTODAY IN B.C.\nEnvironment Canada issues multiple warnings as B.C. braces for weekend heat\nVIDEO: Cherry season in the pits for the Okanagan\n2 killed in West Vancouver head-on were international students: police\nConservatives have more money than rivals, spent far more on ads\nAccidental firefighting foam spill leads to disaster in Abbotsford creek \nMore from Today In BC >\n \nAgassiz-Harrison Observer\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nAdvertising\nSupport Centre\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nJoin our Team\nNews\nLocal News\nNewsletters\nSubscribe\nToday in BC\nCanadian News\nWorld News\nEntertainment\nSports\nBusiness\nTrending Now\nOpinion\nSubmit News Tips\nNeighbours\nAbbotsford News\nChilliwack Progress\nMission City Record\nHope Standard\nMore\nOur Community\nPublic Notices\nVideo\nPhoto Galleries\nTravel\nWest Coast Traveller\nCannabis\nToday's Home\nPodcasts\nFood\nLife\nContact Us\nContests\nPuzzles\nContests\nShop\nImpress Stories\nSavvy Shopper\nImpress TV\nAdd Your Business\nE-Editions\nClassifieds\nAll Classifieds\nPost a Print Ad\nItems for Sale\nGarage Sales\nBook a Print Ad\nAuto\nToday's Drive\nAuto Showcase\nJobs\nLocalWork\nJoin Our Team\nObituaries\nCelebrations of Life\nFuneral Care Services\nIn Memory\nPlace an Obituary\nGood News\nLocal Good News\nSocial Media\nAgassiz-Harrison Live\nToday in BC\nYoutube\nI love British Columbia\nI love Alberta\nI love Nunavut\nI love Yukon\nI love Northwest Territories\n\u00a9 2024 Agassiz-Harrison Observer and Black Press Media Publications Contact"},

We\u2019ve got to recognize that.\u201d\n\nShe feels that the lack of education and the lack of recognition of MMIWG2S further erode the chances of some of these missing women being found.\n\nAtkinson says she has seen unwavering support from the City of Dawson Creek, such as through not having to apply for permits for the upcoming event.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe have a good relationship with the city,\u201d said Atkinson. \u201cThe biggest part in bridging the divide in the country comes from education.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the event or the Nawican Friendship Centre, call their offices at (250)782-5202.\n\nReport a typo or an error\n\nRead our guiding principles\n\nStay connected with local news\n\nMake us your\n\nhome page\n\nDownload\n\nour App\n\nJoin our\n\nNewsletter\n\nGet news\n\ntexted to you\n\nAuthor\nED HITCHINS, LOCAL JOURNALISM INITIATIVE REPORTER\n\nA guy who found his calling later in life, Edward Hitchins is a professional storyteller with a colourful and extensive history.\n\nBeginning his journey into journalism in 2012 at Seneca College, Edward also graduated from Humber College with an Advanced Diploma in Print and Broadcast Journalism in 2018.\u00a0 After time off from his career and venturing into other vocations, he started his career proper in 2022 in Campbell River, B.C.\n\nEdward was attracted to the position of Indigenous Voices reporter with Energeticcity as a challenge.\u00a0 Having not been around First Nations for the majority of his life, he hopes to learn about their culture through meaningful conversations while properly telling their stories.\u00a0\n\nIn a way, he hopes this position will allow both himself and Energeticcity to grow as a collective unit as his career moves forward and evolves into the next step.\n\nHe looks forward to growing both as a reporter and as a human being while being posted in Fort St. John.\n\nThis reporting position has been funded by the Government of Canada and the Local Journalism Initiative.\n\nPost navigation\n\u2190 Previous Post\nNext Post \u2192\nMost Recent Stories\nSilverberry Secure Landfill to possibly undergo new management\nBY MAX BOWDER \u25cf NEWS \u25cf JULY 4, 2024\n\nSECURE Energy Services Inc. has applied to the B.C.

Her case was closed three months later, with no notification to Tolley and her family.\n\n\"We never got any information, so this is why I'm still here 20 years later bringing her case up.\"\n\nShe founded Families of Sisters in Spirit in 2011, and has been fighting ever since for more accountability from the government and police, as well as expanded services for Indigenous people.\n\nWhen women and girls from First Nation, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis communities are murdered or go missing, Tolley says families can be left feeling helpless.\n\n\"These national organizations - they're not involved,\" she explained. \"They work from nine to five, and after that, who helps families? Most of the time, it's the families that have been doing their own searches.\"\n\nA 2023 study from Statistics Canada shows from 2009 to 2021, the rate of homicides against First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit women and girls was six times higher than that of non-indigenous Canadians.\n\nNine in 10 homicides involving Indigenous women and girls that were reported to police during that timespan were solved.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2021, a third of unsolved homicides involving Indigenous women and girls began with the victim being reported missing at the time of her death.\n\nMany, like Amanda Fox, only heard of the stats after a tragedy.\n\n\"My sister, she was murdered 11 years ago - that gave me awareness,\" she said. \"Learning the hard way, but now to have these events, it's really important to spread that awareness.\"\n\nThe two dozen gatherers shared a meal as Sunday\u2019s rain pelted the tents overhead \u2013 a good turnout for a damp day, but Fox says she wants to see more.\n\n\"I find people still turn a blind eye so there's a lot to be done.

As a result, there exist a number of community organizations aimed at providing support to these groups.\n\n\"We have a lot of great organizations and I just think it behooves us to support them,\" said Rideau-Vanier Coun.

The installation was part of the REDress Project, which hopes to raise awareness about missing or murdered Aboriginal women across Canada.\n\nOctober 22, 2019\nACTIVISM\nRed Dress Art Exhibition Raises Awareness of Assault Against Indigenous Women\nBy Justine Kim\nLIKE\nTWEET\n EMAIL\nPRINT\nMORE\n\nOn Monday, brilliant red dresses swung from the trees of Cornell\u2019s campus to raise awareness on a national crisis.\n\nThe REDress Project is an extension of an art installation by Canadian artist Jaime Black. The exhibition comments on the high rates of sexual assault and murder among Indigenous women in the United States.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Black spoke at an event in Statler Hall organized by Native American and Indigeous Students at Cornell, where she covered REDress\u2019s initiatives and influences as well as its purpose on the Cornell campus.\n\n\u201cWe need to make space for Indigenous voices in institutions like this and we have to value and take seriously, Indigenous-led initiatives and going forward in institutions like this,\u201d Black told The Sun in an interview.\n\nThe artist said she was inspired to continue the REDress project after witnessing other works and social movements for the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women\u2019s movement, such as the Kokum Scarf campaign on Instagram and Nadia Kwandiben\u2019s \u201cRed Works Photography.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, REDress reflects the red dresses hung at a memorial for Tina Fontaine, a First Nations girl whose murder instigated a multi-million dollar inquiry by the Canadian government in 2016.\n\nAccording to Black, the meaning behind her choice to use red is open to interpretation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to give people clear answers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to come at the work with your own connection with that color.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut to me, it\u2019s the sacredness of that lifeblood,\u201d Black continued. \u201c[Red] shows that sacred life blood is being spilled. It shows that there is also violence happening.\u201d\n\nAccording to Black, each dress is a memorial for Indigenous women who became victims of institutionalized acts of colonial erasure. She hoped that the red dresses could open up space for people to talk about \u201cthe politics of land here at Cornell.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor those of us who are Indigenous on campus, most of us have or know someone who has gone missing who is within our family or within our friend group,\u201d Annabel Young \u201921, co-chair of Native American and Indigenous Students at Cornell, told The Sun in an interview. \u201cMy great grandma was Ojibwa [and] was murdered by my great grandpa.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be indigenous and to be female moving throughout the world, there is a risk of violence that is different than other groups experience,\u201d Young said.\n\nYoung said the red dresses should remind students of \u201cthe resonancy of Indigenous genocide \u2026 and remembrance that this is indigenous land wherever you go.\u201d\n\nSachem Sam George, one of the chiefs of the Cayuga Nations, and his wife, Debbie George, also attended Black\u2019s talk. Sachem George is the only chief presently living in Cayuga territory, according to Debbie George, and gave the opening words at the event to represent the missing and murdered Indigenous women of Cayuga Nations.\n\nIn her presentation, Black said that she was moved after hearing Jo-Ann Episkewnew, director of the Indigenous People\u2019s Health Research Center at the University of Regina, speak about the genocide of Indigenous women in Canada.\n\nBlack collaborated with native artists at the Urban Shaman Contemporary Aboriginal Art Gallery and contacted people around the world asking for donations of red dresses to her project. In her presentation, Black said she received over 400 red dresses in 2009 alone, many donated by non-Indigenous people.\n\nIn 2011, Black installed the first REDress exhibition in her own city at the University of Winnipeg.\u00a0\n\nSince then, the critically-acclaimed REDress project has been installed in the National Museum of the American Indian, the Canadian Museum of Human Rights and various universities around the United States. Cornell is the third installment of the REDress project in the United States.\n\nBlack is part of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, an international coalition movement working against violence towards First Nations, Inuit, M\u00e9tis and other Native American communities.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s allowed to take space here? Who\u2019s not allowed to take space here? Why is this colonial institution built on this land?\u201d Black said in her closing comments. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s something that you guys can work on. Let\u2019s start unpacking that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nCLICK HERE TO SUPPORT THE SUN\n\nRELATED\nArt Installation on Libe Slope Sheds Light on Indigenous Tragedy\nBy Finley Williams October 17, 2021\n\nThe pile of logs blocking a path on the slope were part of an art installation aiming to draw attention to indigenous struggle.\n\nCornell\u2019s Land Grant Heritage: A Sinister Tradition?\nBy Sean O'Connell April 24, 2020\n\nalmost 1 million acres of dispossessed American Indian land, sold to form the basis of Cornell\u2019s endowment \u2014 a sum of almost $6 million by 1914, equivalent to $150 million today.\nThe sale of almost 1 million acres of dispossessed American Indian land formed the basis of Cornell\u2019s endowment \u2014 a sum of almost $6 million by 1914, equivalent to $150 million today.\n\nX\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024, The Cornell Daily Sun\n\nHome Contact Us Advertise Publication Calendar Email Subscription Download our iPhone App Staff\n\nBack to top \u2191"},

The Red Dress Project, a reminder of missing and murdered Indigenous women, quietly urges us to feel and to think on a deeper level, which lasts longer than being momentarily shocked, writes Anny Scoones. DARREN STONE, TIMES COLONIST\n\nDo you enjoy public art, sculpture and monuments, and have you considered its relevance?\n\nThe intent of public art is so very diverse. Some monuments and sculpture remind us to never forget the horrors and ravages of war. Other pieces might depict a heroic event, such as the Terry Fox statue at Mile Zero.\n\nSome public art may \u00adsimply be intended to bring joy to those who walk past \u2014 think of those towering, joyous colourful \u00adflowers beside the parking lot at Victoria International Airport, welcoming you home.\n\nAnd occasionally, a piece of public art or sculpture or \u00adinstallation will actually \u00adchallenge the observer, \u00adshocking us into uncomfortable and uneasy reflection.\n\nI saw two installations that I will never forget when I was a child, both in Quebec. A warning: Don\u2019t read this if you are eating.\n\nThe first was next to a \u00adrestaurant in a busy shopping mall. The towering plexiglas structure was meant to \u00adrepresent our digestive system.\n\nAt specific times of the day, the restaurant dumped its great white buckets of food waste and plates of uneaten food into its \u201cmouth\u201d at the top. The spectators then witnessed the food being slowly digested.\n\nThroughout the process, various squirts of dark green bodily fluids were added as the food churned and oozed into a brown slurry sludge into the lower winding twisted regions of the \u201cbody,\u201d which was finally (this is the part I recall the most vividly, being six years old) squeezed and squirted out with great \u00adguttural sound effects in one final purging push into a huge shiny white bowl.\n\nThe little cluster of spectators gazed at the splattered plastic contraption, perhaps in disgust or perhaps in fascination, but did not walk away until the process was completed.\n\nThe other installation I recall was in a museum. I was with my mother, and the room was dimly lit by only a bare bulb on a string. Below the bulb was an electric chair, the kind used in executions. Strapped into the chair was a lifelike man. The chair had a lever on the side and museum visitors were invited to pull the lever, thus performing the execution.\n\nI remember vividly, although I was very young, that the atmosphere was rather horrifying. This installation was exhibited during the capital-punishment debate in Canada. Mum wouldn\u2019t pull the lever and neither would I \u2014 nobody did.\n\nIf you would like to read about sculpture and public art, I suggest the book Sculpture In Canada: A History, by Canadian cultural historian Maria Tippett (2017, Douglas and McIntyre).\n\nIn this large and heavy informative book, you will find chapters on prehistoric artifacts, war memorials, First Nation and Inuit carvings, contemporary works from across the country and, yes, a chapter titled Sculpture Shock.\n\nIn this chapter, the author describes the \u201cFlesh Dress\u201d by artist Jana Sterbak, with a colour photograph: \u201cSome twenty kilograms of raw flank steak must be acquired, then sewn together and hung on a tailor\u2019s dummy ... \u00adduring the course of exhibiting \u2026 the meat dries and flakes \u2014 and smells \u2014 thereby reinforcing the themes of death, decay and the transience of life \u2026\u201d This type of sculpture is too obvious for me, but at the time, 1987, the meat dress was considered innovative and extraordinary.\n\nShocking public art is intended to provoke thought and reflection about controversial or uncomfortable issues. While it was quite common for art to provide shock at one time, I feel that shock has lost its impact \u2014 perhaps society is becoming jaded, or hopefully, gentler.\n\nA far more meaningful and profound kind of art these days uses subtle and simple symbolism, the most moving being, in my view, the Red Dress Project, which reminds us all of \u00admissing and murdered Indigenous women. This type of public art quietly urges us to feel and to think on a deeper level, and thinking on a deeper level and feeling moved lasts longer than being momentarily shocked.\n\nIf you drive up-Island, you will see the dresses, entangled amongst the roadside shrubbery, or twisting high in tree branches, perhaps freely flapping in the breeze, or draped over the banks of wild lupines and daisies that line the highway. In winter, the dresses become wind-whipped and saturated but cling on mightily, their grip strong.\n\nThe Red Dress concept, originally spelled REDress, was created by the Winnipeg M\u00e9tis artist Jaime Black. There\u2019s a stunning photograph on the internet of the original exhibit of dresses hung in a grove of birches.\n\nPublic art is a unique perspective on our country, past and present. The shared grief over the unmarked graves of 215 residential school children found in Kamloops has created a very profound piece of public art on the legislative steps \u2014 silent, but there for all to see, deeply moving and relevant to our times.\n\nSee a typo/mistake?\nHave a story/tip?\nThis has not been shared.

What we are watching in Canada ...\nCanadian Press\nMay 5, 2023 1:15 AM\nMay 5, 2023 1:20 AM\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nStatistics Canada building and signs are pictured in Ottawa on Wednesday, July 3, 2019. Statistics Canada is set to release its April labour force survey this morning, providing updated numbers on employment levels in the country. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick\n\nIn The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of May 5 ...\n\nWhat we are watching in Canada ...\n\nStatistics Canada is set to release its April labour force survey this morning, providing updated numbers on employment levels in the country.\u00a0\n\nRBC says it expects 12,000 jobs were added last month, the lowest number since September. \u00a0\n\nEmployers have kept their hiring appetite in recent months, even as high interest rates make borrowing more expensive for people and businesses.\u00a0\n\nThe unemployment rate continued to sit at five per cent in March, hovering near record lows.\n\nHowever, job vacancies have been falling and the Bank of Canada's recent business outlook survey shows employers reporting less intense labour shortages.\u00a0\n\nThe Bank of Canada's aggressive rate hikes are expected to filter through to the labour market in the coming months, leading to a rise in unemployment.\u00a0\n\n---\n\nAlso this ...\n\nA United Nations initiative aimed at eliminating gender-based violence is asking Canada to put up cash to help stem a backsliding in women's rights, even though the Liberals are cutting back on foreign aid.\n\n\"Women's rights and violence against women and girls is not a side issue,\" said Nahla Valji, the UN's senior gender adviser, a position Canada pushed to have created at the agency's headquarters in New York.\n\nValji, who grew up in Burnaby, B.C., is on Parliament Hill this week asking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to help stop an erosion of women's rights globally.\n\nShe's following up on a letter from UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, who asked Trudeau to help fund what's called the Spotlight Initiative.\n\nThe project launched in 2017 with the European Union pledging 500 million euros, or roughly $740 million, for projects that work to curb gender-based violence and to give women a seat at the table in post-conflict negotiations.\n\nSpotlight Initiative works in two dozen of the world's poorest countries, helping local groups launch projects that provide women with employment while weeding out violence.\n\nValji's office wouldn't share the letter, but said it \"invites Canada to be a partner in scaling up the investment\" by the end of 2023, and said the letter didn't specify an amount.\n\nShe's leaning on the Liberals' rhetoric about putting women at the centre of their diplomatic efforts, such as through a feminist aid policy.\n\n\"Canada has always been a leader on the international stage, going back to Lester B. Pearson through to today, in terms of multilateralism,\" she said. \"Canada throughout history has walked the talk, in terms of the values of the (UN) charter.\"\n\nThe government says it's assessing the request. But at the same time, federal cutbacks have the development sector preparing to scale back programs.\u00a0\n\nThe Liberals insist a 15 per cent drop in funding for foreign aid is not actually a cut because it's higher than their pre-pandemic spending.\n\n---\n\nAnd this too ...\n\nThe head of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada says it\u2019s clear there's an ongoing emergency nearly four years after the final report into missing and murdered Indigenous woman and girls was released.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe are in a crisis,\u201d said Carol McBride.\u00a0\n\nRed dresses are set to be on display across the country Friday to recognize the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People. It has become known as Red Dress Day and the empty garments serve as a symbol of lives that have been lost.\n\nEach year there are more events, rallies and art displays. Despite the increased awareness and an extensive national inquiry, McBride said the situation that Indigenous girls and women face has not substantially changed.\n\n\u201cI'm a mother. I'm a sister. I'm an aunt,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I'm just imagining some of our families and our women are suffering right now.\u201d\n\nThe inquiry\u2019s final report was released in 2019 and included sweeping calls for change. It found Indigenous women and girls are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than any other group in Canada.\u00a0\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau accepted the findings of the inquiry, which said the crisis amounted to genocide.\n\nSixty-three per cent of Indigenous women have experienced violence and nearly half have experienced sexual assault, Statistics Canada said in a report last year.\u00a0\n\nWinnipeg has been called ground zero.\n\nAt least 28 Indigenous women in Manitoba have died due to violence since May 2020, said Sandra DeLaronde, team lead for the Manitoba MMIWG2S+ implementation team. The majority were in Winnipeg.\u00a0\n\n---\n\nWhat we are watching in the U.S. ...\n\nPHILADELPHIA _ Three fired police officers who pleaded guilty to misdemeanour charges in the death of an eight-year-old girl killed when they opened fire outside a high school football game near Philadelphia are set to be sentenced Friday.\n\nFormer Sharon Hill officers Brian Devaney, Devon Smith and Sean Dolan have pleaded guilty to 10 counts each of reckless endangerment. Investigators say they could not determine which officer fired the shot that killed Fanta Bility on Aug. 27, 2021. The charge carries a maximum term of up to two years in prison in Pennsylvania.\n\nProsecutors contend the officers negligently fired 25 shots at a car they mistakenly thought was involved in gunfire that broke out as spectators left the football game in 2021. Devaney was not wearing a body camera, and the other two officers did not turn their cameras on, investigators found.\n\nBility had attended the game at Academy Park High School with her mother and an older sister who was also shot but survived. In all, four people were hit by police bullets that sped past the car.\n\nThe handling of the case prompted outrage and protests from the Black community and others as District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer initially charged two Black teens who engaged in gunfire a block away _ which prompted the police response _ with the child's death. Those charges were later dropped, and, after a grand jury investigation, the officers were instead charged with voluntary and involuntary manslaughter along with the endangerment counts.\n\nThe November plea agreements that dismissed those more serious charges came after consultations with the Bility family.\n\nThe family, who belong to a community of immigrants from West Africa, said it was important that the officers take responsibility for the girl's death and the trauma they experienced. They have a federal lawsuit pending against the defendants and the Sharon Hill police department.\n\nLawyers for the ex-officers, who have been free on bail, initially called her death a tragedy caused by the teens who engaged in gunfire. The lawyers did not immediately return calls seeking comment Thursday.\n\n---\n\nWhat we are watching in the rest of the world ...\n\nBELGRADE, Serbia _ Serbian police said they have arrested a suspect in a drive-by shooting attack that killed at least eight and wounded 14, the nation's second such mass shooting in two days.\n\nIn a statement, police said that the man, identified by initials U.B., was arrested early Friday near the central Serbian town of Kragujevac, about 100 kilometres south of Belgrade.\n\nThe arrest followed an all-night search by hundreds of police, who sealed off an area south of Belgrade where the shooting took place late Thursday.\n\nThe attacker shot randomly at people in three villages near Mladenovac, some 50 kilometres south of the capital, RTS said.\n\nSerbian Interior Minister Bratislav Gasic called Thursday's drive-by shootings ``a terrorist act,'' state media reported.\n\nThe shooting came a day after a 13-year-old boy used his father's guns to kill eight fellow students and a guard at a school in Belgrade.\n\nThe bloodshed sent shockwaves through a Balkan nation scarred by wars, but unused to mass murders.\n\nThough Serbia is awash with weapons left over from the wars of the 1990s, Wednesday's school shooting was the first in the country's modern history. The last mass shooting before this week was in 2013, when a war veteran killed 13 people in a central Serbian village.\n\n---\n\nOn this day in 1950 ...\n\nWaves caused by 80-km/h winds broke through dikes surrounding Winnipeg. The water inundated the Manitoba capital, forcing one-third of the population to leave their homes. The flooding left one person dead and caused $100 million in damage.\n\n---\n\nIn entertainment ...\n\nThe family members of some of the men who died in a shipwreck in 1975 are mourning the death of Gordon Lightfoot.\u00a0\n\nThe legendary folk musician, who died Monday, immortalized the 29 crewmen in his famous song \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.\"\n\nThe song was released in 1976, one year after the ship sank in Lake Superior during a storm.\n\nDeborah Champeau says when she heard the news of Lightfoot's death, it felt like finding out the ship sank again.\u00a0\n\nChampeau's father was a third assistant engineer on the vessel.\n\nLightfoot formed a relationship with many of the families over the years after he reached out to explain why he wrote the song.\u00a0\n\nLightfoot also joined families in 2015 at an event marking the 40th anniversary of the shipwreck.\n\n---\n\nDid you see this?\n\nIt may have been the greatest battle between robots and humans to ever take place inside a Saskatchewan brewery.\u00a0\n\nThe grain mash was masterful and the fermentation feisty as a brewer went head to head in a taste-off with ChatGPT to find out who, or what, can make the best beer.\u00a0\n\nThe idea for the faceoff against the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot came out of a meeting between staff at 9 Mile Legacy Brewing, a Saskatoon nanobrewery known for making craft beer and pushing boundaries.\u00a0\n\nGarrett Pederson, 9 Mile\u2019s co-founder and head brewer, said they were playing around with the explosively popular chatbot earlier this year and thought it would be fun to test the technology\u2019s usefulness when it comes to one of the oldest drinks humans have produced.\n\nChatGPT, developed by U.S.-based company OpenAI, was challenged to create an \"award-winning\" gose recipe using local ingredients. A gose is typically a sour and salty beer with origins in Germany.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it made a Saskatoon berry gose.\n\nPederson came up with his own recipe for a rhubarb ginger sour. He used the tried and true methods of researching old brew records and recipes, talking with other brewers and looking online.\u00a0\n\nThe two beers were put in front of customers for a blind taste test, and while Team Human put in a good fight, it was ultimately Team Robot that took the win with 60 per cent of the votes\n\nPederson says it was a fun experiment, but he doesn\u2019t expect to see the artificial intelligence taking over any time soon.\u00a0\n\nThere had to be a lot of help from human brewers to make it drinkable.\u00a0\n\n---\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 5, 2023.\n\nThe Canadian Press\n\nHave a story idea?\nLetter to the editor\nReport a mistake\nThis has not been shared.

They are still gone, there are no answers, no action, no respect.\"\n\nDesjarlais, who was 35 years old when she disappeared, was last seen on a security camera climbing into a dumpster with her significant other outside of the Centre for Hope in Fort McMurray, AB, on Oct. 3, 2010. They were looking to find a place to sleep.\n\nFootage shows the man leaving the dumpster in the morning, and later a garbage truck emptying the dumpster, but after a nine-day search of the landfill her remains were never found.\n\nShelly Dene was 26 years old when she was reported missing by a family member on Nov. 8, 2013, though she had been out of contact since August 2013.\n\nL'hommecourt said the loss of two family members has left a significant void in her family, but not knowing what happened to them is even harder to bear.\n\nOver 1,017 Indigenous women and girls were murdered between 1980-2012, according to the RCMP, with 164 missing persons cases unsolved, a number that continues to grow.\n\nThe Stolen Sisters Walk, one of several held across Canada, was not only an opportunity to raise awareness of the issue of violence against first nations, aboriginal and inuit women - who experience a homicide rate four times higher than all other women - but a chance for family members left behind to support each other in their grief.\n\n\"Grief is hard, and you don't really heal from grief, but this is something we can give to families when so much has been taken,\" said lead organizer Toni Letendre.\n\n\"Part of this is a healing,\" said Tony Alexis, Treaty 6 Grande Chief and Chief of the Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation who marched with the crowd. \"It's to bring love and unity, and it's inviting everyone to join in this heartache that these families are dealing with.\"\n\nAlexis has experienced the loss in his own family, with relative Misty Potts, 37, missing since March. She was last seen in the Enoch Cree Nation on March 14, 2015, and was believed to be heading into Edmonton.\n\nBut in order to prevent more women falling victim, Alexis said the relationship between the government and indigenous communities must improve and be based in mutual repsect and understanding.\n\nLetendre echoed his concerns, saying the first step is addressing cultural biases within ourselves, prejudices that invite violence.\n\n@ClaireTheobald\n\nclaire.theobald@sunmedia.ca\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdvertisement 2\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle content\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nHeart Surgeon Shares 3 Min Routine For Daily Bowel Movements\nGundry MD\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nSUNshine Girl Tina\nEdmonton Sun\nSUNshine Girl Dannie\nEdmonton Sun\nUse This and Never Have to Change Your Whipper Snipper Line Again\nUltraCut\n|\nSponsored\nStudent Discovers Genius Device to Wipe Out Mosquitoes Instantly\nTop Review Picks\n|\nSponsored\nA Teaspoon Every Night Burns Body Fat Like Never Before!\nEats Your Belly Fat\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nThese Barefoot Shoes are Leaving Neuropathy Experts Baffled\nBarefoot Vitality\n|\nSponsored\nTRENDING\nTrudeau mocked for goofy 'Seinfeld' dance at GTA street festival: 'Embarrassing the whole country'\nMan asked two teen girls to have sex with him, punched boy: St. Albert RCMP\nViolent sex offender police warned of last year freed in Edmonton again\nBreaking down the new-look Edmonton Oilers by position for 2024-25\nInside The Oilers: Oilers add more firepower up front\nREAD NEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLATEST NATIONAL STORIES\nTHIS WEEK IN FLYERS"},

Statistics Canada is set to release its April labour force survey this morning, providing updated numbers on employment levels in the country. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick\nMay 05, 2023 - 1:15 AM\n\nIn The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of May 5 ...\n\nWhat we are watching in Canada ...\n\nStatistics Canada is set to release its April labour force survey this morning, providing updated numbers on employment levels in the country.\n\nRBC says it expects 12,000 jobs were added last month, the lowest number since September.\n\nEmployers have kept their hiring appetite in recent months, even as high interest rates make borrowing more expensive for people and businesses.\n\nThe unemployment rate continued to sit at five per cent in March, hovering near record lows.\n\nHowever, job vacancies have been falling and the Bank of Canada's recent business outlook survey shows employers reporting less intense labour shortages.\n\nThe Bank of Canada's aggressive rate hikes are expected to filter through to the labour market in the coming months, leading to a rise in unemployment.\n\n---\n\nAlso this ...\n\nA United Nations initiative aimed at eliminating gender-based violence is asking Canada to put up cash to help stem a backsliding in women's rights, even though the Liberals are cutting back on foreign aid.\n\n\"Women's rights and violence against women and girls is not a side issue,\" said Nahla Valji, the UN's senior gender adviser, a position Canada pushed to have created at the agency's headquarters in New York.\n\nValji, who grew up in Burnaby, B.C., is on Parliament Hill this week asking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to help stop an erosion of women's rights globally.\n\nShe's following up on a letter from UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, who asked Trudeau to help fund what's called the Spotlight Initiative.\n\nThe project launched in 2017 with the European Union pledging 500 million euros, or roughly $740 million, for projects that work to curb gender-based violence and to give women a seat at the table in post-conflict negotiations.\n\nSpotlight Initiative works in two dozen of the world's poorest countries, helping local groups launch projects that provide women with employment while weeding out violence.\n\nValji's office wouldn't share the letter, but said it \"invites Canada to be a partner in scaling up the investment\" by the end of 2023, and said the letter didn't specify an amount.\n\nShe's leaning on the Liberals' rhetoric about putting women at the centre of their diplomatic efforts, such as through a feminist aid policy.\n\n\"Canada has always been a leader on the international stage, going back to Lester B. Pearson through to today, in terms of multilateralism,\" she said. \"Canada throughout history has walked the talk, in terms of the values of the (UN) charter.\"\n\nThe government says it's assessing the request. But at the same time, federal cutbacks have the development sector preparing to scale back programs.\n\nThe Liberals insist a 15 per cent drop in funding for foreign aid is not actually a cut because it's higher than their pre-pandemic spending.\n\n---\n\nAnd this too ...\n\nThe head of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada says it\u2019s clear there's an ongoing emergency nearly four years after the final report into missing and murdered Indigenous woman and girls was released.\n\n\u201cWe are in a crisis,\u201d said Carol McBride.\n\nRed dresses are set to be on display across the country Friday to recognize the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People. It has become known as Red Dress Day and the empty garments serve as a symbol of lives that have been lost.\n\nEach year there are more events, rallies and art displays. Despite the increased awareness and an extensive national inquiry, McBride said the situation that Indigenous girls and women face has not substantially changed.\n\n\u201cI'm a mother. I'm a sister. I'm an aunt,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I'm just imagining some of our families and our women are suffering right now.\u201d\n\nThe inquiry\u2019s final report was released in 2019 and included sweeping calls for change. It found Indigenous women and girls are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than any other group in Canada.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau accepted the findings of the inquiry, which said the crisis amounted to genocide.\n\nSixty-three per cent of Indigenous women have experienced violence and nearly half have experienced sexual assault, Statistics Canada said in a report last year.\n\nWinnipeg has been called ground zero.\n\nAt least 28 Indigenous women in Manitoba have died due to violence since May 2020, said Sandra DeLaronde, team lead for the Manitoba MMIWG2S+ implementation team. The majority were in Winnipeg.\n\n---\n\nWhat we are watching in the U.S. ...\n\nPHILADELPHIA _ Three fired police officers who pleaded guilty to misdemeanour charges in the death of an eight-year-old girl killed when they opened fire outside a high school football game near Philadelphia are set to be sentenced Friday.\n\nFormer Sharon Hill officers Brian Devaney, Devon Smith and Sean Dolan have pleaded guilty to 10 counts each of reckless endangerment. Investigators say they could not determine which officer fired the shot that killed Fanta Bility on Aug. 27, 2021. The charge carries a maximum term of up to two years in prison in Pennsylvania.\n\nProsecutors contend the officers negligently fired 25 shots at a car they mistakenly thought was involved in gunfire that broke out as spectators left the football game in 2021. Devaney was not wearing a body camera, and the other two officers did not turn their cameras on, investigators found.\n\nBility had attended the game at Academy Park High School with her mother and an older sister who was also shot but survived. In all, four people were hit by police bullets that sped past the car.\n\nThe handling of the case prompted outrage and protests from the Black community and others as District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer initially charged two Black teens who engaged in gunfire a block away _ which prompted the police response _ with the child's death. Those charges were later dropped, and, after a grand jury investigation, the officers were instead charged with voluntary and involuntary manslaughter along with the endangerment counts.\n\nThe November plea agreements that dismissed those more serious charges came after consultations with the Bility family.\n\nThe family, who belong to a community of immigrants from West Africa, said it was important that the officers take responsibility for the girl's death and the trauma they experienced. They have a federal lawsuit pending against the defendants and the Sharon Hill police department.\n\nLawyers for the ex-officers, who have been free on bail, initially called her death a tragedy caused by the teens who engaged in gunfire. The lawyers did not immediately return calls seeking comment Thursday.\n\n---\n\nWhat we are watching in the rest of the world ...\n\nBELGRADE, Serbia _ Serbian police said they have arrested a suspect in a drive-by shooting attack that killed at least eight and wounded 14, the nation's second such mass shooting in two days.\n\nIn a statement, police said that the man, identified by initials U.B., was arrested early Friday near the central Serbian town of Kragujevac, about 100 kilometres south of Belgrade.\n\nThe arrest followed an all-night search by hundreds of police, who sealed off an area south of Belgrade where the shooting took place late Thursday.\n\nThe attacker shot randomly at people in three villages near Mladenovac, some 50 kilometres south of the capital, RTS said.\n\nSerbian Interior Minister Bratislav Gasic called Thursday's drive-by shootings ``a terrorist act,'' state media reported.\n\nThe shooting came a day after a 13-year-old boy used his father's guns to kill eight fellow students and a guard at a school in Belgrade.\n\nThe bloodshed sent shockwaves through a Balkan nation scarred by wars, but unused to mass murders.\n\nThough Serbia is awash with weapons left over from the wars of the 1990s, Wednesday's school shooting was the first in the country's modern history. The last mass shooting before this week was in 2013, when a war veteran killed 13 people in a central Serbian village.\n\n---\n\nOn this day in 1950 ...\n\nWaves caused by 80-km/h winds broke through dikes surrounding Winnipeg. The water inundated the Manitoba capital, forcing one-third of the population to leave their homes. The flooding left one person dead and caused $100 million in damage.\n\n---\n\nIn entertainment ...\n\nThe family members of some of the men who died in a shipwreck in 1975 are mourning the death of Gordon Lightfoot.\n\nThe legendary folk musician, who died Monday, immortalized the 29 crewmen in his famous song \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.\"\n\nThe song was released in 1976, one year after the ship sank in Lake Superior during a storm.\n\nDeborah Champeau says when she heard the news of Lightfoot's death, it felt like finding out the ship sank again.\n\nChampeau's father was a third assistant engineer on the vessel.\n\nLightfoot formed a relationship with many of the families over the years after he reached out to explain why he wrote the song.\n\nLightfoot also joined families in 2015 at an event marking the 40th anniversary of the shipwreck.\n\n---\n\nDid you see this?\n\nIt may have been the greatest battle between robots and humans to ever take place inside a Saskatchewan brewery.\n\nThe grain mash was masterful and the fermentation feisty as a brewer went head to head in a taste-off with ChatGPT to find out who, or what, can make the best beer.\n\nThe idea for the faceoff against the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot came out of a meeting between staff at 9 Mile Legacy Brewing, a Saskatoon nanobrewery known for making craft beer and pushing boundaries.\n\nGarrett Pederson, 9 Mile\u2019s co-founder and head brewer, said they were playing around with the explosively popular chatbot earlier this year and thought it would be fun to test the technology\u2019s usefulness when it comes to one of the oldest drinks humans have produced.\n\nChatGPT, developed by U.S.-based company OpenAI, was challenged to create an \"award-winning\" gose recipe using local ingredients. A gose is typically a sour and salty beer with origins in Germany.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it made a Saskatoon berry gose.\n\nPederson came up with his own recipe for a rhubarb ginger sour. He used the tried and true methods of researching old brew records and recipes, talking with other brewers and looking online.\n\nThe two beers were put in front of customers for a blind taste test, and while Team Human put in a good fight, it was ultimately Team Robot that took the win with 60 per cent of the votes\n\nPederson says it was a fun experiment, but he doesn\u2019t expect to see the artificial intelligence taking over any time soon.\n\nThere had to be a lot of help from human brewers to make it drinkable.\n\n---\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 5, 2023.\n\nNews from \u00a9 The Canadian Press, 2023\n\n\nMore News ...\niN RESPONSE: Readers have their say\nFollowing are emailed reader responses to stories or letters to...\nChefs mourn for Okanagan's peaches but adapt to stone fruit wipeout\nKelowna woman loses legal fight with housing co-op over medical cannabis\nFrom no strata fees to discounted golf, Okanagan developers using promos to sell homes\nPopular Vernon News\nOkanagan contractors fined $19,000 for unsafe building sites\nJuly 02, 2024 6:00 PM\nKamloops homeless day services set to close with no promised replacement\nJuly 03, 2024 6:00 AM\nKelowna breeder wins after being sued over sick Labradoodle\nJuly 03, 2024 7:00 AM\nVernon cabinetmaker ordered to pay $2,500 for shoddy work\nJuly 01, 2024 6:00 AM\n'Merchants of death': Lengthy sentence for Vernon fentanyl dealer\nJuly 01, 2024 6:00 PM\nTop News\nRCMP working with city to prevent criminals from visiting Kelowna businesses\nJuly 04, 2024 2:30 PM\nKamloops police investigating targeted gangland shooting\niNwheels\nJuly 04, 2024 1:05 PM\nNo more lengthy delays in Highway 97 rock slide zone near Summerland\niNwheels\nJuly 04, 2024 11:55 AM\nHow to stay cool at work during southern Interior heat wave\nJuly 04, 2024 10:50 AM\nChefs mourn for Okanagan's peaches but adapt to stone fruit wipeout\niNwine\nJuly 04, 2024 9:41 AM\nTrending Now\nTRENDING NOW: Stormtrooper party balloon chaos\nKamloops\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nKamloops Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nKelowna\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nKelowna Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nPenticton\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nPenticton Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nVernon\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nVernon Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\n\u00a9 2024 InfoTel News Ltd\nContact iNFOTEL MULTIMEDIA |\u00a0\nContact iNFOnews |\u00a0\nSubmit News Tips |\u00a0\nPrivacy Policy & Disclaimer |\u00a0\nSitemap |\u00a0\nNewsletter Signup\nView Site in: Desktop | Mobile"},

He admitted to giving false testimony under oath, and other aspects of his testimony was contradicted by other evidence,\" said Denham.\n\nDenham said that after one of the most resource-intensive and technical investigations her office has ever undertaken, she concluded \"that it is more likely than not that the email records were in fact deleted by ministerial assistant George Gretes.\"\n\nGretes eventually admitted he lied after his computer underwent a forensic examination, but not before also lying several times about when and how the events happened, who was involved and why it was done, Denham noted.\n\nShe said Gretes \"triple-deleted\" the emails, a practice that removes all trace from the government servers because it deletes not only the original email, but the version in the trash folder and then the version within the government's recovered deleted emails folder.\n\nDuncan said in an interview Thursday he felt vindicated by the report, but that the problem of record destruction is widespread within government among political staff and not an isolated incident.\n\n\"It's not just young 22-year-old staffers doing this, it's senior experienced people conducting themselves in this way, clearly against the law, they clearly knew better,\" he said.\n\nThe deleted emails and documents related to how the B.C. government consulted with northern communities and First Nations leaders last year to try to improve safety along the Highway of Tears.\n\nFirst Nations leaders remain unhappy at government inaction to improve transportation and safety issues on a road where women have gone missing and been murdered.\n\nDuncan had said he wasn't sure what specifically was contained in the emails because they were deleted so quickly.\n\nThe missing 36 pages of emails were ordered released by the commissioner, and the government said it would comply.\n\n\"In the course of this investigation, we uncovered negligent searches for records, a failure to keep adequate email records, a failure to document searches, and the willful destruction of records responsive to an access request,\" said Denham.\n\n\"Taken together, these practices threaten the integrity of access to information in British Columbia.\"\n\nDenham's report also zeroed in on Premier Christy Clark's deputy chief of staff, Michele Cadario, noting that she keeps almost none of her emails.\n\n\"The commissioner found that the broad interpretation given to transitory records by the deputy chief of staff, which results in her retaining almost no sent emails, effectively frustrates the Office of the Premier's ability to comply with (section six, subsection one) of FIPPA (the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act),\" wrote Denham in her report.\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nReport a mistake\nThis has not been shared.

There is an epidemic of violence that is taking our loved ones from us.\n\nOttawa (10\u00a0Sept. 2018) \u2014 The Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada is pleased to announce the 13th\u00a0annual Sisters In Spirit Vigils coming this October 4.\u00a0\u00a0The violence experienced by Indigenous women and girls in Canada is a national tragedy.\u00a0\n\nUnited front supporting those who have lost loved ones; united front fighting for action and change\n\nEach year, family members, Indigenous community members, and supporters\u00a0gather on October 4\u00a0on Parliament Hill and across the country. People gather to honour the women and girls and their families\u00a0who have been impacted by violence. It is a demonstration of a\u00a0united front. There is an epidemic of violence against Indigenous women and girls, Two Spirit, and gender diverse people that is unacceptable.\u00a0\n\nThe vigils are powerful movements of social change with the number of vigils growing\u00a0from 11 in 2006 to an impressive 212 vigils in 2017.\n\nOn this day, people\u00a0link arms across Canada and throughout the world to show solidarity, demand action and change, and to provide support to each other.\n\nWhat\u00a0you can do in your community\n\nThe National Union of Public and General Employees (NUPGE) encourages its members across the country to get involved and support vigils in their community.\n\nVigils can take a variety of forms. They can be large or small in scale, and every single one is of great value. Some examples include\u00a0moments of silence\u00a0or\u00a0candlelight vigils, which can create spaces for honouring the\u00a0missing and murdered women and girls and opportunities for healing for families.\u00a0Rallies\u00a0or\u00a0marches\u00a0are powerful ways of raising public awareness and calling for legislative change.\n\nAll initiatives that support this goal are important. To register your vigil on or around October 4,\u00a0please return the registration form by September 5. Registered vigils will receive a kit that includes items that can be used at your vigil, speaking notes that can support your vigil, and an activity that you may choose to participate in.\n\nThe Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada (NWAC) produced a resource guide to help friends and supporters safely and responsibly raise awareness of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG).

M\u00e9tis artist Jaime Black helped inspire the red dress movement, where red dresses are hung from windows and trees to represent the pain and loss felt by loved ones and survivors.\n\nHistory\n\nOriginally starting as the REDdress art installation, Red Dress Day became a grassroots movement across Canada. The project was made up of 600 community-donated red dresses, which were later placed in public spaces throughout Winnipeg and across Canada.\n\nThe artist chose the colour red after speaking with an Indigenous friend who told her that is the only colour spirits can see. Red dresses are used to call the spirits of missing and murdered women and girls back to their loved ones. The goal was to speak to the gendered and racialized nature of violent crimes against Indigenous women and to evoke a presence by marking absence.\n\nEvents\nExpand all\nAthabasca\n \nCalgary\n \nCochrane\n \nEdmonton\n \nFort McMurray\n \nMedicine Hat\n \nRed Deer\nContact\n\nIf you have a 2024 event you would like to highlight, please contact us at ir.communications@gov.ab.ca.\n\nRelated\nAlberta Joint Working Group on MMIWG\nIndigenous Women\u2019s Initiatives\nIncreasing safety for Indigenous women and girls\nFamily Information Liaison Unit\nBack to\nSisters in Spirit Day\nLead ministry:\nIndigenous Relations\n\nWas this page helpful?\n\nYes No\nAlberta.ca\nFooter\nMinistries\nJobs\nContact government\nStaff directory\nAbout Links\nAbout Links\nUsing Alberta.ca\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nAccessibility\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nLinkedin\n\u00a9 2024 Government of Alberta\nBack to top"},

Every year, individuals wear red, and attend marches, rallies, bike rides, fundraisers and more, to raise awareness of the MMIW cause and fight against the injustice happening to Native women and their families every day.\n\nWW Photo: Gloria Rubac\n\nIn Houston, the South East Texas Brown Berets held two rallies and a march through the predominantly Chicano community north of downtown to honor Native people.\n\nIndigenous activist Terry Spoonhunter drummed, prayed and sang songs to open the event. \u201cWe were the first people here. We had peace. We believed in nature, in the sun, in the water, in the air we breathe. And we protected this,\u201d he said.\n\nWillie Rodriguez, an organizer for the Berets, told the crowd: \u201cThis issue needs to be brought to life; it\u2019s hidden, like many things that happen with Native people. Our own people are out celebrating Cinco de Mayo with alcohol right now instead of coming together in solidarity with things that really matter. So I thank all of you for being here today.\u201d\n\nOne of the central organizers of this event, Beret Vio Nat, had a red handprint over her mouth and was holding a red dress. She explained: \u201cThe hand print is the symbol of this growing movement and stands for all the missing sisters whose voices are not heard, as well as the silence of the police and the news media. It is mostly non-Natives who attack and kill Indigenous women.\n\n\u201cA progressive event that recently happened was that, in 2013, the Violence Against Women Act was updated to allow Tribal courts to prosecute non-Indigenous offenders.\n\n\u201cThroughout Indian Country, throughout Tribal jurisdictions, and throughout reservations, actions are being held today. It is also called Red Dress Day.\u201d\n\nNat was holding a large color photo of a young girl and said: \u201cMaria Gonzales was murdered in her home here in Houston last August by someone in her apartment complex. We want to remember her as she was only 11 years old and was from Guatemala.\u201d\n\nSylina Mustang spoke on how important the issue of Indigenous women and girls is: \u201cWe are honoring the women, girls, and men. There\u2019s not enough media attention on this.\u201d Mustang was wearing a red T-shirt with a photo of Luis Jr. Martinez, a leader of the Chicano activist group of the 1960s and \u201870\u2019s, the Crusade for Justice, based in Denver. She told Workers World: \u201cMartinez was also a victim of murder 50 years ago. He was another person whose death wasn\u2019t given the attention it deserved.\u201d\n\nWW Photo: Gloria Rubec\n\nAlso speaking were representatives of Workers World Party and Party for Socialism and Liberation. Jesus Sanchez, with PSL, said; \u201cIsrael caused much destruction in Central America in the 1980\u2019s, especially toward Indigenous tribes such as the Mayan population in Guatemala. Along with the U.S., they trained forces in the genocide of the Mayans under the R\u00edos Montt regime.\u201d\n\nSpeaking for Workers World Party, this writer stated: \u201cLook at the photo of this beautiful 11-year-old girl from Guatemala. We must understand why she and her family were even here in Houston. It is because of U.S. imperialism destroying the economies and overthrowing the leadership of Central American countries that people are forced to leave their homes.\n\n\u201cIt is the U.S. that is responsible for little Maria\u2019s death. She and her family should never have been forced to be here.\u201d\n\nIndigenous women\nMurdered and missing women and girls\n\u2190 Previous article\nNext article \u2192\nStay connected\nGet Workers World FREE in your Inbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate to Workers World!\n\nDefend workers\u2019 rights, build Workers World!>>>\n\nJoin Us!\nThis week\u2019s PDF\n\nJune 27, 2024 issue\nPast issues\n\nSearch by month\nSearch by month\nSelect Month\nJuly 2024\nJune 2024\nMay 2024\nApril 2024\nMarch 2024\nFebruary 2024\nJanuary 2024\nDecember 2023\nNovember 2023\nOctober 2023\nSeptember 2023\nAugust 2023\nJuly 2023\nJune 2023\nMay 2023\nApril 2023\nMarch 2023\nFebruary 2023\nJanuary 2023\nDecember 2022\nNovember 2022\nOctober 2022\nSeptember 2022\nAugust 2022\nJuly 2022\nJune 2022\nMay 2022\nApril 2022\nMarch 2022\nFebruary 2022\nJanuary 2022\nDecember 2021\nNovember 2021\nOctober 2021\nSeptember 2021\nAugust 2021\nJuly 2021\nJune 2021\nMay 2021\nApril 2021\nMarch 2021\nFebruary 2021\nJanuary 2021\nDecember 2020\nNovember 2020\nOctober 2020\nSeptember 2020\nAugust 2020\nJuly 2020\nJune 2020\nMay 2020\nApril 2020\nMarch 2020\nFebruary 2020\nJanuary 2020\nDecember 2019\nNovember 2019\nOctober 2019\nSeptember 2019\nAugust 2019\nJuly 2019\nJune 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nMarch 2019\nFebruary 2019\nJanuary 2019\nDecember 2018\nNovember 2018\nOctober 2018\nSeptember 2018\nAugust 2018\nJuly 2018\nJune 2018\nMay 2018\nApril 2018\nMarch 2018\nFebruary 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nNovember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nAugust 2017\nJuly 2017\nJune 2017\nMay 2017\nApril 2017\nMarch 2017\nFebruary 2017\nJanuary 2017\nDecember 2016\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nAugust 2016\nJuly 2016\nJune 2016\nMay 2016\nApril 2016\nMarch 2016\nFebruary 2016\nJanuary 2016\nDecember 2015\nNovember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nAugust 2015\nJuly 2015\nJune 2015\nMay 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nJanuary 2015\nDecember 2014\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nAugust 2014\nJuly 2014\nJune 2014\nMay 2014\nApril 2014\nMarch 2014\nFebruary 2014\nJanuary 2014\nDecember 2013\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nSeptember 2013\nAugust 2013\nJuly 2013\nJune 2013\nMay 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\nDecember 2012\nNovember 2012\nOctober 2012\nSeptember 2012\nAugust 2012\nJuly 2012\nSearch by keywords\nCategories\nAfrica\nAsia & the Pacific\nClimate and Environmental Crisis\nDisability rights\nEditorials\nEurope\nGlobal\nHealth Care\nHuman needs before profits\nIm/migrants and Refugees\nLatin America & the Caribbean\nLGBTQ2S+ liberation\nMiddle East\nMundo Obrero\nPrisons: tear them down\nRacism and Self-Determination\nRevolutionary Theory and Practice\nSports, Arts and Culture\nStop imperialist war and occupation\nTop\nU.S. and Canada\nWomen and oppressed genders\nWorkers unite!\nWorkers World Party\nYouth and Students\nWW books\n\nWhy Colin Kaepernick is right\n\nWorkers World Party\n\nPDF of July 4 issue\n\nPDF of June 27 issue\n\nLeslie Feinberg to Aswat: \u2018I am at your side\u2019\n\nPDF of June 20 print issue\n\nNo to criminalization of sex work!\n\nEmail and print subscriptions\nA FREE subscription to Workers World News is available online, with new articles posted five days a week.

Here is what\u2019s on the radar of our editors for the morning of May 5 \u2026\n\nWhat we are watching in Canada \u2026\n\nStatistics Canada is set to release its April labour force survey this morning, providing updated numbers on employment levels in the country.\u00a0\n\nRBC says it expects 12,000 jobs were added last month, the lowest number since September. \u00a0\n\nEmployers have kept their hiring appetite in recent months, even as high interest rates make borrowing more expensive for people and businesses.\u00a0\n\nThe unemployment rate continued to sit at five per cent in March, hovering near record lows.\n\nHowever, job vacancies have been falling and the Bank of Canada\u2019s recent business outlook survey shows employers reporting less intense labour shortages.\u00a0\n\nThe Bank of Canada\u2019s aggressive rate hikes are expected to filter through to the labour market in the coming months, leading to a rise in unemployment.\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso this \u2026\n\nA United Nations initiative aimed at eliminating gender-based violence is asking Canada to put up cash to help stem a backsliding in women\u2019s rights, even though the Liberals are cutting back on foreign aid.\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s rights and violence against women and girls is not a side issue,\u201d said Nahla Valji, the UN\u2019s senior gender adviser, a position Canada pushed to have created at the agency\u2019s headquarters in New York.\n\nValji, who grew up in Burnaby, B.C., is on Parliament Hill this week asking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to help stop an erosion of women\u2019s rights globally.\n\nShe\u2019s following up on a letter from UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, who asked Trudeau to help fund what\u2019s called the Spotlight Initiative.\n\nThe project launched in 2017 with the European Union pledging 500 million euros, or roughly $740 million, for projects that work to curb gender-based violence and to give women a seat at the table in post-conflict negotiations.\n\nSpotlight Initiative works in two dozen of the world\u2019s poorest countries, helping local groups launch projects that provide women with employment while weeding out violence.\n\nValji\u2019s office wouldn\u2019t share the letter, but said it \u201cinvites Canada to be a partner in scaling up the investment\u201d by the end of 2023, and said the letter didn\u2019t specify an amount.\n\nShe\u2019s leaning on the Liberals\u2019 rhetoric about putting women at the centre of their diplomatic efforts, such as through a feminist aid policy.\n\n\u201cCanada has always been a leader on the international stage, going back to Lester B. Pearson through to today, in terms of multilateralism,\u201d she said. \u201cCanada throughout history has walked the talk, in terms of the values of the (UN) charter.\u201d\n\nThe government says it\u2019s assessing the request. But at the same time, federal cutbacks have the development sector preparing to scale back programs.\u00a0\n\nThe Liberals insist a 15 per cent drop in funding for foreign aid is not actually a cut because it\u2019s higher than their pre-pandemic spending.\n\n\u2014\n\nAnd this too \u2026\n\nThe head of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada says it\u2019s clear there\u2019s an ongoing emergency nearly four years after the final report into missing and murdered Indigenous woman and girls was released.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe are in a crisis,\u201d said Carol McBride.\u00a0\n\nRed dresses are set to be on display across the country Friday to recognize the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People. It has become known as Red Dress Day and the empty garments serve as a symbol of lives that have been lost.\n\nEach year there are more events, rallies and art displays. Despite the increased awareness and an extensive national inquiry, McBride said the situation that Indigenous girls and women face has not substantially changed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a mother. I\u2019m a sister. I\u2019m an aunt,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just imagining some of our families and our women are suffering right now.\u201d\n\nThe inquiry\u2019s final report was released in 2019 and included sweeping calls for change. It found Indigenous women and girls are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than any other group in Canada.\u00a0\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau accepted the findings of the inquiry, which said the crisis amounted to genocide.\n\nSixty-three per cent of Indigenous women have experienced violence and nearly half have experienced sexual assault, Statistics Canada said in a report last year.\u00a0\n\nWinnipeg has been called ground zero.\n\nAt least 28 Indigenous women in Manitoba have died due to violence since May 2020, said Sandra DeLaronde, team lead for the Manitoba MMIWG2S+ implementation team. The majority were in Winnipeg.\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\nWhat we are watching in the U.S. \u2026\n\nPHILADELPHIA _ Three fired police officers who pleaded guilty to misdemeanour charges in the death of an eight-year-old girl killed when they opened fire outside a high school football game near Philadelphia are set to be sentenced Friday.\n\nFormer Sharon Hill officers Brian Devaney, Devon Smith and Sean Dolan have pleaded guilty to 10 counts each of reckless endangerment. Investigators say they could not determine which officer fired the shot that killed Fanta Bility on Aug. 27, 2021. The charge carries a maximum term of up to two years in prison in Pennsylvania.\n\nProsecutors contend the officers negligently fired 25 shots at a car they mistakenly thought was involved in gunfire that broke out as spectators left the football game in 2021. Devaney was not wearing a body camera, and the other two officers did not turn their cameras on, investigators found.\n\nBility had attended the game at Academy Park High School with her mother and an older sister who was also shot but survived. In all, four people were hit by police bullets that sped past the car.\n\nThe handling of the case prompted outrage and protests from the Black community and others as District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer initially charged two Black teens who engaged in gunfire a block away _ which prompted the police response _ with the child\u2019s death. Those charges were later dropped, and, after a grand jury investigation, the officers were instead charged with voluntary and involuntary manslaughter along with the endangerment counts.\n\nThe November plea agreements that dismissed those more serious charges came after consultations with the Bility family.\n\nThe family, who belong to a community of immigrants from West Africa, said it was important that the officers take responsibility for the girl\u2019s death and the trauma they experienced. They have a federal lawsuit pending against the defendants and the Sharon Hill police department.\n\nLawyers for the ex-officers, who have been free on bail, initially called her death a tragedy caused by the teens who engaged in gunfire. The lawyers did not immediately return calls seeking comment Thursday.\n\n\u2014\n\nWhat we are watching in the rest of the world \u2026\n\nBELGRADE, Serbia _ Serbian police said they have arrested a suspect in a drive-by shooting attack that killed at least eight and wounded 14, the nation\u2019s second such mass shooting in two days.\n\nIn a statement, police said that the man, identified by initials U.B., was arrested early Friday near the central Serbian town of Kragujevac, about 100 kilometres south of Belgrade.\n\nThe arrest followed an all-night search by hundreds of police, who sealed off an area south of Belgrade where the shooting took place late Thursday.\n\nThe attacker shot randomly at people in three villages near Mladenovac, some 50 kilometres south of the capital, RTS said.\n\nSerbian Interior Minister Bratislav Gasic called Thursday\u2019s drive-by shootings \u201ca terrorist act,\u201d state media reported.\n\nThe shooting came a day after a 13-year-old boy used his father\u2019s guns to kill eight fellow students and a guard at a school in Belgrade.\n\nThe bloodshed sent shockwaves through a Balkan nation scarred by wars, but unused to mass murders.\n\nThough Serbia is awash with weapons left over from the wars of the 1990s, Wednesday\u2019s school shooting was the first in the country\u2019s modern history. The last mass shooting before this week was in 2013, when a war veteran killed 13 people in a central Serbian village.\n\n\u2014\n\nOn this day in 1950 \u2026\n\nWaves caused by 80-km/h winds broke through dikes surrounding Winnipeg. The water inundated the Manitoba capital, forcing one-third of the population to leave their homes. The flooding left one person dead and caused $100 million in damage.\n\n\u2014\n\nIn entertainment \u2026\n\nThe family members of some of the men who died in a shipwreck in 1975 are mourning the death of Gordon Lightfoot.\u00a0\n\nThe legendary folk musician, who died Monday, immortalized the 29 crewmen in his famous song \u201cThe Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.\u201d\n\nThe song was released in 1976, one year after the ship sank in Lake Superior during a storm.\n\nDeborah Champeau says when she heard the news of Lightfoot\u2019s death, it felt like finding out the ship sank again.\u00a0\n\nChampeau\u2019s father was a third assistant engineer on the vessel.\n\nLightfoot formed a relationship with many of the families over the years after he reached out to explain why he wrote the song.\u00a0\n\nLightfoot also joined families in 2015 at an event marking the 40th anniversary of the shipwreck.\n\n\u2014\n\nDid you see this?\n\nIt may have been the greatest battle between robots and humans to ever take place inside a Saskatchewan brewery.\u00a0\n\nThe grain mash was masterful and the fermentation feisty as a brewer went head to head in a taste-off with ChatGPT to find out who, or what, can make the best beer.\u00a0\n\nThe idea for the faceoff against the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot came out of a meeting between staff at 9 Mile Legacy Brewing, a Saskatoon nanobrewery known for making craft beer and pushing boundaries.\u00a0\n\nGarrett Pederson, 9 Mile\u2019s co-founder and head brewer, said they were playing around with the explosively popular chatbot earlier this year and thought it would be fun to test the technology\u2019s usefulness when it comes to one of the oldest drinks humans have produced.\n\nChatGPT, developed by U.S.-based company OpenAI, was challenged to create an \u201caward-winning\u201d gose recipe using local ingredients. A gose is typically a sour and salty beer with origins in Germany.\n\nUnsurprisingly, it made a Saskatoon berry gose.\n\nPederson came up with his own recipe for a rhubarb ginger sour. He used the tried and true methods of researching old brew records and recipes, talking with other brewers and looking online.\u00a0\n\nThe two beers were put in front of customers for a blind taste test, and while Team Human put in a good fight, it was ultimately Team Robot that took the win with 60 per cent of the votes\n\nPederson says it was a fun experiment, but he doesn\u2019t expect to see the artificial intelligence taking over any time soon.\u00a0\n\nThere had to be a lot of help from human brewers to make it drinkable.\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 5, 2023.\n\nThe Canadian Press\n\nby Canadian Press\nAround the Web\nAlberta Residents Born Before 1984 With No Life Insurance Can Get a $250,000\nDollarGuardian\nEveryone From Edmonton: if You Have Wrinkles, Do This Before Bed!\nNeotonics\nRemember Tiger Woods' Ex-wife?

Through the installation I hope to draw attention to the gendered and racialized nature of violent crimes against Aboriginal women and to evoke a presence through the marking of absence.\u201d\n\nAt St. Thomas', the hanging of the dresses was accompanied by a Sunday-morning presentation by Jennifer Davis, a parishioner who has worked extensively in the north and west with various First Nations. Davis was invited to address the congregation by the local committee of the national Anglican Primate's World Relief and Development Fund.\n\n\u201cImpressed again and again by the women she worked with, it was their strength of character in the face of sometimes difficult circumstances and systemic racism that she chose to focus her remarks on,\u201d said Tomlinson. \u201cIn doing so, she and Dorothy Flindall, her fellow presenter, introduced the congregation to nurses, social workers, academics, educators and others \u2013 all of whom had surmounted the various obstacles that often confront Indigenous people to build successful lives and careers, very often careers devoted to helping others surmount the same obstacles.\u201d\n\nWith the launching of a long-demanded national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, Tomlinson said he hopes it's conclusions will be insightful and helpful, and that the government will be able to act on them.\n\n\u201cBut in the meantime, red dresses wave in the wind and the rain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 2\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle content\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nLATEST NATIONAL STORIES\nNEWS NEAR STIRLING\nTHIS WEEK IN FLYERS"},

PHOTO BY DAX MELMER /Windsor Star\nArticle content\n\nRed dresses left to flap in the wind at locations across Windsor on Wednesday were a reminder that the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous girls and women remains a tragic and urgent issue in Canada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still an everyday thing \u2014 there is always someone missing in every province,\u201d said Tina Jacobs, interim executive director of the Can-Am Indian Friendship Centre in Windsor.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nTRENDING\nToo hot \u2014 Windsor Hudson's Bay could open next week after shutting for air conditioning woes\nStorm alert: Weather watcher warns over \u2018superheated\u2019 Lake Erie\nTiny-homes company with Windsor ties wins $1M in Housing Supply Challenge\nReport: Officer described 'possible suicide' on scene where Harrow family found dead\n'Extremely difficult' \u2014 UWindsor VP explains decision to kill University Players\nArticle content\n\nAlmost a dozen red dresses were hung up above the entrance and along a fence outside the centre at 2929 Howard Ave. at sunrise, where they would remain until sunset. Another local \u201cREDress\u201d display created by Metis artist Jaime Black was installed at Assumption College Catholic High School, with a red dress hanging from a tree and students learning online \u201cabout the realities surrounding missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada.\u201d\n\nMay 5 marks the national day of awareness in Canada. Red Dress Day began as a grassroots action in 2017, a year after Ottawa launched its National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, and it has spread across Canada and the United States. Due to the pandemic, public events were toned down this year and last, with Jacobs saying local Can-Am centre staff held morning prayers and smudging, but socially distanced.\n\n\u201cWe think of all the people out there somewhere,\u201d said Jacobs. \u201cTheir families don\u2019t have answers, their loved ones are just not there, and they can\u2019t bring their spirits home so they can rest.\u201d\n\nIn a news release, the local Can-Am Indian Friendship Centre stated: \u201cNative families, advocates and Indigenous Nations continue to rise up to challenge the silence, tolerance and limited action in response to the crisis of (murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls).\u201d\n\nThe Ontario NDP used the occasion to criticize the lack of significant progress in implementing the inquiry\u2019s recommendations for action to end the continued \u201cepidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\u201d\n\ndschmidt@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/schmidtcity\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nHeart Surgeon Shares 3 Min Routine For Daily Bowel Movements\nGundry MD\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nToo hot \u2014 Windsor Hudson's Bay shuts down over failed air conditioning\nWindsor Star\nWindsor police arrest two in drug bust\nWindsor Star\nRoofers Tested 17 Gutter Guards\u2026 Here\u2019s What They Discovered\nThe Actual Cost of Gutter Guards in 2024 May Surprise You\nLeafFilter Partner\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nOne Teaspoon Every Night Burns Body Fat Like Never Before, You Will Fit In Your Pants Again!\nBurn Belly Fat\n|\nSponsored\nBetter than scratching, why you should try this\nDaily Pulse\n|\nSponsored\nAlberta Pensioners Are Eligible For Invisible Hearing Aids\nBest Hearing Aids\n|\nSponsored\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\n\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

And there\u2019s no sign as to where they\u2019ve vanished too, or if they\u2019ll ever be back.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBut hope remains, embodied in the red dress.\n\n\u201cIn lots of tribes, it (the colour red) represents the only colour spirits can see in our culture,\u201d says Elickus. \u201cSo, you know, it hopes to call them home, the ones that are still missing.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where the Red Dress Project comes in.\n\nIt\u2019s a project that was first launched back in 2010. And, for over a decade now, it keeps growing.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nEleven years later, red dresses continue to be hung from tree branches all over Canada, including right here on the island, in an effort to raise awareness.\n\nHowever, according to Campbell River\u2019s Elickus, many still don\u2019t know the story behind the red dress.\n\n\u201cI mean, I hear people saying, what\u2019s that red dress doing hanging there,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to signify?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the question that sparked Elickus to get out there, lead the charge for the Red Dress Project in Campbell River, and hang more red dresses.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIt\u2019s also very personal. She\u00a0lost her sister-in-law back in 1992, as well as her close friend, and her niece.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s really close to me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really dear to me.\u201d\n\nElickus is\u00a0now asking you to keep the significance in mind, and she\u2019s hoping it will spark something within yourself as well with the issue still ongoing.\n\nA \u2018National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls\u2019 report from June 2019 found that there was no \u201creliable estimate of the numbers of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA persons in Canada.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still happening,\u201d Elickus says.\n\n\u201cThe real sad thing is, the cases that are reported don\u2019t go down as missing people, and then families aren\u2019t strong enough to fight or speak for themselves.\u201d\n\nElickus believes it\u2019s important to speak up for people and have a strong voice. She says voices are in numbers and that we must come together.\n\n\u201cAnd then, of course, if there are people like me getting the message out as to why it\u2019s hanging out there, and you see lots of them, it brings awareness quickly,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for people. It\u2019s for the people of our nation, and it reaches out and touches so many different people across the country. It\u2019s for everyone, but for us, it\u2019s very dear.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nElickus says the project doesn\u2019t just revolve around women and girls though, it now extends to missing and murdered indigenous men and boys this year as well.\n\nIt\u2019s an ongoing project, so there\u2019s no end date.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll stay up,\u201d Elickus says. \u201cSome I\u2019ve seen in the past, they\u2019ve been there for years. But, you know, some communities and some people just hang them outside their houses and along the roads or in their communities.\u201d\n\nIf you hang a red piece of clothing outside, Elickus wants you to take a photo and send it to her.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI started an\u00a0album on my Facebook\u00a0called the \u2018Red Dress Challenge Project,\u2019 and I encourage people to hang up red. Red t-shirts, red dresses, any red if they can,\u201d she adds.\n\n- Advertisement -\nFacebookTwitterReddItWhatsAppEmail\n- Advertisment -\n- Advertisment -\n- Advertisement -\nContinue Reading\nAll\nNational\nLifeLabs sold to American diagnostic firm, pledges to protect Canadian patient data\nCowichan Valley\nCVRD wraps up years long project to remove invasive plants from Memory Island\nCowichan Valley\nLadysmith RCMP seeking witnesses of July 2nd collision\nIsland & Coast\n10 earthquakes in 24 hours recorded off Island\u2019s West Coast\nLoad more\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\nIN THE NEWS\n\nLifeLabs sold to American diagnostic firm, pledges to protect Canadian patient data\n \nCVRD wraps up years long project to remove invasive plants from Memory Island\n \nLadysmith RCMP seeking witnesses of July 2nd collision\n \n10 earthquakes in 24 hours recorded off Island\u2019s West Coast\n \nWarmer temperatures expected for Vancouver Island this week\nNew website looks to protect tenants from bad faith evictions\n \nNew urgent primary care centre on the way for Duncan\n \nRegulations for BC hunters updated for next 2 years\n \nNew act to give workers international credit recognition in BC\n \nRCMP, Cowichan SAR on the lookout for missing man in Youbou\n\t\nSUN FM\n\nSunScribers\n \nTour de Rock\n \nMornings with Jason Hatton\n \nMiddays with Nicholas\n \nAfternoons with Justis Doucet\nHawaii of the North\n \nIn Search of Albacore\n \n5 Stunning Lighthouses To See In BC\n \nExploring the BC Bird Trail \u2013 Near You\n \nHealth and Happiness in Your Own Backyard\nNews\nWin\nEvents\nContact Us\nContest Rules\nAdvertise\nWe\u2019re Hiring"},

Two-spirit is a term used by some Indigenous people to describe their gender and spiritual identity.\n\nAdvocates also have denounced systemic inaction on the part of government and law enforcement agencies to address the issue.\n\nIn Canada, the federal police force reported in 2014 that nearly 1,200 Indigenous women had been murdered or gone missing in Canada between 1980 and 2012 \u2013 but community members have said the real number was likely much higher.\n\nA National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls concluded in 2019 that the violence \u201camounts to a race-based genocide of Indigenous Peoples\u201d that especially targets women, girls and members of the LGBTQ2S+ community.\n\nOn Friday, a group of Canadian ministers expressed support for all those affected by the violence.\n\nSign up for Al Jazeera\nAmericas Coverage Newsletter\nUS politics, Canada\u2019s multiculturalism, South America\u2019s geopolitical rise\u2014we bring you the stories that matter.\nSubscribe\nPlease check your email to confirm your subscription\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\nprotected by reCAPTCHA\n\n\u201cWe are committed to working in partnership with Indigenous families, survivors, leaders, and partners, as well as with provinces and territories, to make transformational change that will end this national crisis,\u201d they said in a joint statement.\n\nBut in the lead-up to the day of commemoration, Indigenous leaders said Canada had not done enough to address the decades-long crisis.\n\nCanadian legislators unanimously passed a motion in the House of Commons on Tuesday urging Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government to declare a national emergency. The motion also called\u00a0on Ottawa to set up a \u201cRed Dress Alert\u201d system to notify the public when an Indigenous woman, girl or two-spirit person goes missing.\n\n\u201cThis is a crisis.

More than just an array of fabulous fashions (though it is that, too), VIFW is a space that\u2019s created for Indigenous people by Indigenous people. Founder Joleen Mitton, who is Plains Cree, established it as an event that fosters community, collaboration, and even healing. A prime example of the latter is VIFW\u2019s annual Red Dress showcase, which was held on Monday night as this year\u2019s official kick-off event. \u201cThe Red Dress event is part of our healing process,\u201d Mitton tells Vogue. \u201cAt the opening night of every VIFW, we come together as a community and we honor our departed loved ones. We come together to remember and celebrate.\u201d\n\nVIFW\u2019s Red Dress showcase draws inspiration from M\u00e9tis artist Jaime Black\u2019s REDress Project, a national art movement in Canada that utilizes red dresses to represent the thousands of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit (MMIWG2S) people in the country. Indigenous groups in Canada continue to be disproportionately affected by violence; From 2015 to 2020, the average homicide rate involving Indigenous victims was six times higher than non-Indigenous victims. At Vancouver\u2019s Queen Elizabeth Theatre, Native designers were asked to create red designs that drew attention to this ongoing epidemic. \u201cThe red dress has become a powerful symbol of remembrance and a call for justice,\u201d says Mitton. \u201cRecognizing and addressing this issue is crucial for the well-being and safety of the community.\u201d\n\nThe arresting color red boldly calls attention to the important movement, though it also has spiritual significance (in Indigenous culture, red transcends the physical world). \u201cRed represents the fire of our people\u2014a flame that can never be extinguished, no matter how hard it gets,\u201d says Yolonda Skelton, a Gitxsan designer who created a gown made of precious metals and suede. She also incorporated imagery of a phoenix onto her design. \u201cThe phoenix itself is a symbol of rebirth, resilience, and transformation. It represents the strength and resilience of Indigenous women, girls and [Two-Spirit people], and their ability to rise above adversity.\u201d\n\nA model wears a look by Helen Oro. Photographed by Alana Paterson\n\nSkelton was one of six Indigenous designers who created a special dress for this year\u2019s VIFW. Designer Rebecca Baker-Grenier (Kwakiutl/Dzawada\u02bcenuxw/Squamish) crafted a cape coat with her signature West Coast paintwork on it. It stems from her We Are Warriors collection. \u201cMy collection is inspired by our ancestral warriors, who were strong, courageous, and persistent in protecting our villages, communities, and culture in battle against colonial armies,\u201d she says. \u201cIndigenous people have always fought to resist colonization and safeguard our communities.\u201d Inuit designer April Allen also created a red shift dress, shown with traditional matching moccasins. \u201cMy design serves as a symbol of remembrance and solidarity, weaving together the significance of this movement in every stitch,\u201d says Allen.\u00a0\n\nOcean Kiana, who is Ojibway/Anishinaabe, created several red looks for the showcase, including pieces such as traditional ribbon skirts. \u201cI didn\u2019t limit myself to a single dress\u2014instead, each piece narrates distinct stories from my life, interwoven with the profound connection we have to the land,\u201d says Kiana. \u201cThe significance of the color red represents my identity as Nishinaabe (Ojibway), because it is the color that we use in ceremonies to present the Manidoo (spirit). [I also used] beautiful floral patterns, inspired from my traditional territory, Biigtigong Nishnaabeg.\u201d\n\nDancers backstage in traditional regalia before opening the Red Dress showcase. Photographed by Alana Paterson\n\nFor two of the designers featured in the showcase\u2014Helen Oro (Plains Cree) and Taalrumiq (Inuvialuit/Gwich\u2019in)\u2014the theme of the evening hit especially close to home. Both have been personally affected by the epidemic, and wanted to use their fashions as a call to action. \u201cIt was important for me to share the story of Frank Gruben, my relative who is currently missing in our home territory of the Northwest Territories since May 2023,\u201d says Taalrumiq, who created a traditional Inuvialuit design made of sealskin and wolf fur. \u201cI hope by sharing Frank\u2019s story, it encourages someone to come forward with information that can help bring him home to his mom, family, and community.\u201d\n\nDesigner Oro shares an equally poignant backstory around one of the red garments she created (her lineup of looks were entirely in red). \u201cMy 11-year old nephew and I collaborated on designing a dress,\u201d says Oro, who created all of the beaded jewelry to go with her nephew\u2019s design. \u201cHis mother, who was my little sister, was murdered about six months ago: Our collaboration together is in honor of her. His mom\u2019s name was Kehiew Iskwew Fox, and part of the material he chose to use represents her name. This has been a healing process for the both of us.\u201d\n\nIndividually, each Indigenous designer brought a sense of strength and resiliency to the showcase, and Mitton says this variety of perspectives and styles is exactly what fashion needs. \u201cShowcasing diversity in the Red Dress Event sends a powerful message about unity and solidarity,\u201d says Mitton. \u201cIt emphasizes that the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous people is a collective concern that transcends individual backgrounds.\u201d The VIFW founder hopes to make the Red Dress show an annual tradition. It\u2019s now in its fourth year running, and has no plans of stopping until the epidemic is addressed. \u201cI hope that the Red Dress movement continues to raise awareness and push for the justice that is so desperately needed,\u201d says Mitton. \u201cFashion has a unique and powerful ability to convey messages, tell stories, and evoke emotions.\u201d\n\nThe crowd at the Red Dress showcase.\nPhotographed by Alana Paterson\nDancers backstage before opening the Red Dress showcase.

We are also dedicated to researching the underlying causes of this violence and to working with Native communities to address them,\u201d Biden said.\n\nIndigenous communities have sounded the alarm for years over the disproportionately high number of women, girls and two-spirit people who have been killed or disappeared in the US and Canada. Two-spirit is a term used by some Indigenous people to describe their gender and spiritual identity.\n\nAdvocates also have denounced systemic inaction on the part of government and law enforcement agencies to address the issue.\n\nIn 2014, the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) reported that nearly 1,200 Indigenous women had been murdered or gone missing in Canada between 1980 and 2012 \u2013 but advocates say the real number was likely much higher.\n\nA National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in 2019 concluded that the violence \u201camounts to a race-based genocide of Indigenous Peoples\u201d that especially targets women, girls and members of the LGBTQ2S+ community.\n\n\u201cThis genocide has been empowered by colonial structures \u2026 leading directly to the current increased rates of violence, death, and suicide in Indigenous populations,\u201d it said.\n\nBut Indigenous community advocates say too little has been done to address the problem.\n\nSign up for Al Jazeera\nAmericas Coverage Newsletter\nUS politics, Canada\u2019s multiculturalism, South America\u2019s geopolitical rise\u2014we bring you the stories that matter.\nSubscribe\nPlease check your email to confirm your subscription\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\nprotected by reCAPTCHA\n\n\u201cAlmost three years after the National Inquiry into #MMIWG released their Final Report, we are still waiting on the concrete actions that must be taken outlined in the Calls for Justice,\u201d Lynne Groulx, CEO of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada (NWAC), said on Twitter on Thursday.\n\nIn the US, the National Crime Information Center in 2016 documented 5,712 reports of missing American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls, according to a report by the Urban Indian Health Institute (PDF).\n\n\u201cThe Center[s] for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that murder is the third-leading cause of death among American Indian and Alaska Native women and that rates of violence on reservations can be up to ten times higher than the national average,\u201d the report also said.\n\nA 2016 study by the National Institute of Justice also found that 84.3 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence in their lifetime, including 56.1 percent who have experienced sexual violence, the US Department of the Interior says on its website.\n\nUS interior secretary Deb Haaland, the first Indigenous person to head a cabinet agency in the history of the country, held an event on Thursday to recognise National Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Day.\n\n\u201cEveryone deserves to feel safe in their community, but a lack of urgency, transparency and coordination have hampered our country\u2019s efforts to combat violence against American Indians and Alaska Natives,\u201d Haaland, a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAs we work with the Department of Justice to prioritize the missing and murdered Indigenous people\u2019s crisis, the Not Invisible Act Commission will help address the underlying roots of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Peoples crisis by ensuring the voices of those impacted by violence against Native people are included in our quest to implement solutions.\u201d\n\nThe US Congress signed the Not Invisible Act into law in October 2020, just months before Biden took office, and the commission aims to increase coordination and implement best practices to fight \u201cthe epidemic of missing persons, murder, and trafficking\u201d affecting Indigenous communities.\n\nIn Canada, communities are hanging red dresses on Thursday to symbolise the many Indigenous women and girls who have gone missing or been murdered in the past decades.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wearing red on #RedDressDay to remember all the #MMIWG and to honour their families and communities. I\u2019m wearing red also because I continue to hold a vision of the future where our women and girls are protected and treated with dignity and respect always,\u201d RoseAnne Archibald, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations in Canada, tweeted.\n\n\u201cOn May 5, we will see the red dresses suspended from trees, hanging from windows, swaying in the breeze. But we will see much more than that. We will see the people who would have worn those crimson garments,\u201d Lorraine Whitman, president of NWAC, said in a statement this week.\n\n\u201cThey were our mothers, our daughters, our sisters, our aunties, our friends \u2026 We want to know what happened. How were they taken from us? And why? But mostly, we want to know that other families will be spared this pain.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: AL JAZEERA\nTop Stories\nREAD MORE\nIsrael approves three\nsettlement outposts, thousands of homes in West Bank\nAdvertisement\nAbout\nAbout Us\nCode of Ethics\nTerms and Conditions\nEU/EEA Regulatory Notice\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nCookie Preferences\nSitemap\nWork for us\nConnect\nContact Us\nUser Accounts Help\nAdvertise with us\nApps\nNewsletters\nChannel Finder\nTV Schedule\nPodcasts\nSubmit a Tip\nOur Channels\nAl Jazeera Arabic\nAl Jazeera English\nAl Jazeera Investigative Unit\nAl Jazeera Mubasher\nAl Jazeera Documentary\nAl Jazeera Balkans\nAJ+\nOur Network\nAl Jazeera Centre for Studies\nAl Jazeera Media Institute\nLearn Arabic\nAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human Rights\nAl Jazeera Forum\nAl Jazeera Hotel Partners\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:\n\n\u00a9 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network\nYou rely on Al Jazeera for truth and transparency\nWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver and personalize content and ads, enable features, measure site performance, and enable social media sharing.

Transportation Minister Todd Stone announced that bus service would begin in the area by the end of the year.\n\nChief Joseph Bevan of the Kitselas First Nation near Terrace said he's part of an advisory group concerned about the safety of people along the 750-kilometre route and that it came together for regular meetings last November after months of discussions.\n\nHe said it's common for people to take a risk and hitchhike in the notorious area because they're too poor to take the train or a Greyhound bus.\n\n\"It's non-aboriginals as well. It's everyone who is on social assistance, people with disabilities, who are having trouble moving around. It makes them vulnerable when they're jumping into a vehicle with somebody else.\"\n\nBevan said that at a meeting in March, a Via Rail official made the proposal to offer a $5 fare along the highway that stretches between Prince Rupert and Prince George.\n\nMichael Woelcke, the railway's general manager for remote services, said in minutes of the meeting held in Prince George on March 30 that the company would offer the low fare \"regardless of origin or destination along the route.\"\n\nHe said Via Rail provides train service three times a week between Prince Rupert and Prince George, and it's open to suggestions on determining eligibility for the $5 fare that would be available to \"at risk\" and \"vulnerable\" people including youth and \"elders.\"\n\n\"We need to identify who would qualify for this program, as we cannot provide everyone with these reduced fares,\" he said in the minutes.\n\nWoelcke said a minimum $75 one-way fare would be reduced by a third for aboriginal passengers.\n\nWoelcke was not available for comment, and the company said an official would provide details if and when an arrangement is worked out with the province.\n\nVia Rail said in an emailed statement that a discounted fare for \"vulnerable\" people is one of the options being studied and that discussions with the Transportation Ministry and the advisory group are ongoing.\n\nThe ministry said interconnectivity of services along Highway 16 has been part of discussions and that Via Rail was included to determine what role it could play to increase transportation options.\n\n\"We continue to engage with Via Rail on the idea of offering a discounted train fare to vulnerable First Nations people,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe group is slated to meet again next month.\n\nAs for the promised new bus service between Prince George and Prince Rupert, the ministry said the first of more than 20 public information sessions hosted by BC Transit will start Saturday.\n\nBC Transit said Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, which is part of the advisory group, has provided $1 million in funding for features including enhanced bus stop shelters and CCTV cameras to ensure passengers' safety along the corridor.\n\nThe route provides the main transportation link to and from remote First Nations villages located off the main highway.\n\nMost of the cases of murdered and missing women remain unsolved, but police have said it's believed that more than one killer is involved.\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nReport a mistake\nThis has not been shared.

In concert with similar groups across the country, these organizations have worked intensely to end violence against Indigenous women in Canada\u2014and specifically to raise awareness about the disproportionate numbers of missing and murdered Indigenous women across Canada.\n\nDr. Alex Wilson will participate in the panel.\n\nNotably, since 2014, a representative from the St. John\u2019s Native Friendship Centre has participated in these annual events. This year, thanks to the collaboration of the centre and Memorial University, the event in St. John\u2019s will realize No More Silence\u2019s vision of strengthening the national network.\n\nSt. John\u2019s emerged as an ideal site for the event, says Amelia Reimer, cultural support worker, St. John\u2019s Native Friendship Centre.\n\n\u201cSome Mi\u2019kmaq elders consider Newfoundland to be \u2018ground zero\u2019 for colonialism. Even the Mayflower stopped here for supplies before continuing on to Plymouth Rock.\u201d\n\nThe event is made possible with funding and support from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC Connection Grants); Memorial University Conference Fund; and the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences Conference Fund.\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nShare\n\nJanet Harron is a communications advisor with the Harris Centre.

They just blew me away. I was so excited for them to be passionate about it.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHailey Dyck and\u00a0Ma Ayisha Ron Plazo with their collaborative piece.\n\nStudents Hailey Dyck and Ma Ayisha Ron Plazo collaborated on a portrait of a woman, constructed of the names of MMIWG2S.\u00a0\n\n\"[We] didn't want to do statistics, because it dehumanizes them,\" said Ron Plazo. \"So if we did names, it shows that\u00a0there's an actual life behind all those numbers.\"\n\nThe youngest name the pair found belonged to a nine-month-old girl who had been kidnapped and remains missing.\n\nCassie Jewitt and Ryen Bauman stand on either side of their painting.\n\nAfter three days of work, Cassie Jewitt and Ryen Bauman's painting was finished and hung on the walls of the SCCHS hallways.\n\n\"We wanted to do a piece that showed what was\u00a0missing ... there's a handprint over her mouth to\u00a0show the silence,\" explained Bauman. \"I do feel like there's not enough like being spoken about what's going on.\"\n\nShae Wentworth proudly stands with her window art.\n\nThree women are portrayed staring ahead into darkness to show the feeling of being lost,\u00a0in Shae Wentworth's window art. The high schooler used pops of red to stir feelings of sorrow, while also representing blood.\n\n\"I'm Indigenous ... it was a little hard for me,\" Wentworth shared about creating art on the topic of MMIWG2S. \"I've heard stories, and it's scary for me. It leaves me vulnerable.\"\u00a0\n\nSharing the same window as Wentworth's piece\u00a0is the vibrant red handprint done by Kiera Manjo (pictured on the cover of the article).\u00a0\n\nManjo found inspiration for her piece from another artist's similar work. She chose to paint it for it's simplicity and power.\u00a0\n\n\"People notice the handprint, obviously, but then it takes a moment to find the face in it, and I think that goes to show how when you actually do take the time to learn about it and look at it, you see how it impacts people,\" Manjo said. \"I think it's\u00a0really important to show this representation and help people become more aware of it so we can all be doing what we can.\"\n\nNEXT STORY\nCelebrate Mom and win!\nLATEST IN LOCAL NEWS\nEmergency Preparedness Week begins in Swift Current\nWhat to do this weekend in Swift Current\nWood River Search and Rescue give Swift Current a heads up for tonight\nMinister for Health reacts to SEIU-West protest\nLATEST STORIES ON SWIFTCURRENTONLINE\nFamily, friends, and community walk to bring Byron Watson home\nRCMP actively working to mitigate fraud in Swift Current\nMoose Jaw RCMP investigating human remains located in the RM of Moose Jaw\nSwift Current adorns itself in red in honour of Indigenous woman and girls\nEvents\nSwift Current 57\u2019s Baseball Club Home Game\nThu, Jul 4, 7:00 PM\nPride Centre Grand Reopening!\nSat, Jul 6, 9:00 AM\nCountry Pleasures TEAHOUSE\nSat, Jul 6, 1:38 PM\nSwift Current 57\u2019s Baseball Club Home Game\nSat, Jul 6, 7:00 PM\nSaskatchewan Motocross Round 4 Located in Swift Current.\nSun, Jul 7, 9:15 AM\nView more \nJobs\nPowered by\nLumber Yard Office Manager\nFull-time, Salary, Administrative, Retail, Sales\nFeatured\nTruck or Combine Operator\nHourly, Seasonal, Agriculture, Labour\nHeavy Duty Mechanic Apprentice\nFull-time, Skilled Trades\nFarm Labourer - Summer Student\nSeasonal, Agriculture\nTire Technician I (FT)\nLabour, Full-time\nView more \nBuy & Sell\nPowered by\nRadio frequency machine\n$350\n2017 Ford Explorer XLT\n$32900\nFishing hunting shooting bag\n$45\nHead massager\n$100\nBrand new 2000 gallon fibreglass sewage holding tank\n$7000\nView more \nCKSW\nCJSN\nCountry 94\nMagic 97.1\nPodcasts\nGet the App\nNEWS\nLocal News\nAg News\nLocal Sports\nNational News\nCommunity\nFuneral Announcements\nSponsored\nWeather\nFEATURES\nEvents\nLocalJobShop\nHelloGoodBuy Classifieds\nGarage Sales\nGreeting Zone\nRoad Reports and Cancellations\nLocal Sports Live\nInspirational Programming Guide\nTrading Post\nCONTESTS\nSouthwest Explorer\nTip Of The Hat\nCONNECT\nContact Us\nSubmit News\nMeet the Team\nFacebook\nX\nYouTube\nStreaming\nRSS\nAdvertise With Us\nCareers\nContest Rules\nAccessibility\nTerms Of Use Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\nJournalistic Standards"},

(Olivier Laurin / Comox Valley Record)\nExpand\nListen to this article\n00:04:43\n\nDespite the rain, Verna Wallace slowly walked up the stage at Simms Park to share her story in front of a quiet and attentive crowd on Sunday (May 5).\n\n\u201cMy sister has been missing since 1971,\u201d said Wallace. \u201cI was away from home and I got a letter telling me that she had been missing\u2026 I would sleep on my patio every night hoping I would hear her calling me. I did that for six months.\n\n\u201cMy sister was pregnant when she was murdered\u2026 that really broke my heart. I love and miss (her) so much. My mom and dad are gone, so I think they are together now. I think they are gathering up there and I hope they\u2019re looking down on us. (Today) we\u2019re walking with our missing and murdered sisters and Two Spirit people.\u201d\n\nWallace was one of three survivors who addressed a large audience as a part of Red Dress Day, held in Courtenay\u2019s Simms Park, which takes place every year on May 5 to raise awareness of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people (MMIWG2S).\n\nOrganized by two local Indigenous organizations \u2013 MIKI\u2019SIW M\u00e9tis Association and the Indigenous Women\u2019s Sharing Society \u2013 the event included educational tables, a drumming circle, an opening ceremony at 1 p.m. and a walk at 2 p.m.\n\nCeremony at the K\u2019\u00f3moks First Nation\n\nEarlier in the day, K\u2019\u00f3moks First Nation elder Donna Mitchell extended an invitation to community members, encouraging them to share their stories.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows somebody who was (murdered or gone) missing,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cNobody learns about what has happened (and) there\u2019s so much prejudice in our community.\n\n\u201cI want us to come together as one\u2026 I (want) more people to come out to share their stories.\u201d\n\nAt 11 a.m. on 3320 Comox Rd., a small group of people gathered and sat in a circle to partake in ceremonial dance and songs, share personal experiences and connect with other members.\n\nIn the crowd were sisters Melanie Hardy and Violet Williams, who said they found Mitchell\u2019s event to be deeply cathartic.\n\n\u201cWe come here to honour several family members. Most important to us is our mother, Abina (Angela Williams), who we lost when we were very young,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cShe was murdered when I was three years old and the case was not taken seriously. Here we are, 23 years later with no answers. Her case is still unsolved.\n\n\u201cWe were told many excuses, (one of them being) that she was gone on vacation, (but) she had three little girls at home waiting for her, and we\u2019re still waiting.\u201d\n\nBelieving in the importance of spreading awareness of the crisis of Indigenous MMIWG2S is paramount to moving things forward in a good direction, believes Hardy.\n\n\u201cFor many years I was really nervous to come out and share this trauma, but I\u2019ve become a mother in the last few years and it\u2019s really opened up how important it is to spread awareness,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat if it was my daughter who was going through this?\u201d\n\nRed Dress Day\n\nThe red dress movement was inspired by Metis artist James Black\u2019s REDress Project, which has come to symbolize loss, grief and injustice over the murder and ongoing violence against MMIWG2S.\n\nThe day also serves as a reminder in communities across the country to end violence against Indigenous and gender-diverse people.\n\n\u201cThe red dress has become a symbol of loss for those who have been taken too soon, and a call to end violence,\u201d said Kelli Paddon, B.C.\u2019s parliamentary secretary for gender equity in a statement.\n\n\u201cFrom 2009 to 2021, 490 Indigenous women and girls were victims of homicide in Canada. In this time frame, the rate of homicide of First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit women and girls was six times higher than the rate among their non-Indigenous counterparts. In Canada, Indigenous women and girls are 12 times more likely to be murdered or missing than any other women.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing signs of distress, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to services available 24/7/365:\n\nHope for Wellness Help Line (Indigenous centred): 1-855-242-3310\n\nCrisis Services Canada: (Canada-wide) 9-8-8\n\nNational Family and Survivors Circle: 1-844-413-6649\n\n- With files from Erin Haluschak\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tRobots, technology take care in Comox's innovative new dementia village\n\t\tComox Valley Ducky 500 winners announced\n\t\tCVRD, Clean BC to offer heat pump and electrical upgrade rebates\n\t\tComox Valley RCMP investigating fatal overnight collision involving pedestrian\n\t\t'You shattered her life': 3 years for sexual assault of young Kelowna woman\nFacebook Comments (0) \nComox Valley RCMP investigating fatal overnight collision involving pedestrian\nBlack Press Media\nDriver airlifted to hospital after Vancouver Island crash\nBlack Press Media\nStudent Discovers Genius Device to Wipe Out Mosquitoes Instantly\nTop Review Picks\n|\nSponsored\nReview: Captain Cooks Casino is the Real Deal\nCaptain Cooks Casino\n|\nSponsored\nPlay Now\nPeople Born 1944-1984 Could Get This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nRead More\nPort Coquitlam convicted murderer dead in Greater Victoria institution\nBlack Press Media\nCougar bites woman in Vancouver Island's Strathcona Park\nBlack Press Media\nStudent Discovers Genius Device to Wipe Out Mosquitoes Instantly!\nTop Review Picks\n|\nSponsored\nCanadians In Alberta With No Life Insurance Are Taking Advantage Of This\nCovered For Life\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nCanadians Born 1944 - 1983 Could Get This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nHead-on crash kills 2, blocks access to BC Ferries terminal\nBlack Press Media\nLETTER: May Wells addresses community regarding 6th Street Bridge project\nBlack Press Media\nYOUR VOTE MATTERS\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nWhat do you think is the most critical challenge facing the youth today?\n Mental health\n Education and employment opportunities\n Social media influence\n Peer pressure and bullying\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nTODAY IN B.C.\nEnvironment Canada issues multiple warnings as B.C. braces for weekend heat\nNew class to immerse Island students in crime scene investigation\nUniversity of Victoria to shut down campus pool after a half-century\nIsland parents fuming at being asked to pay 100s in school bus fees \nVIDEO: Cherry season in the pits for the Okanagan\nMore from Today In BC >\n \nComox Valley Record\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nAdvertising\nSupport Centre\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nJoin our Team\nNews\nLocal News\nNewsletters\nSubscribe\nToday in BC\nCanadian News\nWorld News\nEntertainment\nSports\nBusiness\nTrending Now\nOpinion\nSubmit News Tips\nNeighbours\nCampbell River Mirror\nNorth Island Gazette\nMore\nOur Community\nPublic Notices\nVideo\nPhoto Galleries\nTravel\nWest Coast Traveller\nCannabis\nToday's Home\nPodcasts\nFood\nLife\nContact Us\nContests\nPuzzles\nContests\nShop\nImpress Stories\nSavvy Shopper\nImpress TV\nAdd Your Business\nE-Editions\nClassifieds\nAll Classifieds\nBook a Print Ad\nAuto\nToday's Drive\nAuto Showcase\nJobs\nLocalWork\nJoin Our Team\nObituaries\nCelebrations of Life\nFuneral Care Services\nIn Memory\nPlace an Obituary\nGood News\nLocal Good News\nSocial Media\nComox Valley Live\nToday in BC\nYoutube\nI love British Columbia\nI love Alberta\nI love Nunavut\nI love Yukon\nI love Northwest Territories\n\u00a9 2024 Comox Valley Record and Black Press Media Publications Contact"},

Susan Zielinski\nListen to this article\n00:03:10\n\nIt took about 40 years for Violet Soosay to find her missing and murdered aunt.\n\n\"I grew old looking for my aunt,\" said Violet who spoke during a\u00a0Red Dress Day event held at Red Deer Polytechnic on Thursday.\n\n\"It was many years of not knowing. It kind of tears you apart bit by bit by bit.\"\n\nBut in 2021, the Kern County\u00a0sheriff\u2019s office in California identified the remains of a Jane Doe as belonging to her aunt, Shirley Ann Soosay, 35, who\u00a0had been buried in a cemetery in 1980.\n\nShe was\u00a0stabbed 26 times, and her\u00a0body was discovered dumped in\u00a0an orchard.\u00a0\n\nViolet said American investigators went out of their way to identify her aunt and that's why she was found. But in Canada, initiatives stemming from the\u00a0Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women inquiry are not providing\u00a0the assistance that families need to search and find their missing loved ones.\n\nShe said a fund is needed, which is one of the 231 Calls to Action in the MMIW report,\u00a0to pay the costs associated with searching.\n\n\"That's the one I've been paying attention to, to set up a funding agency of some kind to help these people who have missing family members.\"\n\nViolet and another aunt spent years searching in British Columbia and Seattle where her Aunt Shirley had\u00a0visited before cards and letters she regularly sent to her family suddenly stopped in 1979.\u00a0\n\nShe said in the beginning when they reached out to police they were told more than once, \"She's probably just another dead Indian.\"\n\n\"I learned early not to depend on anyone outside the family.\"\n\nShe said whenever they could pull together enough money for gas, meals and hotel they would continue the search. Some years, they didn't have the money. At one point in the mid-90s detectives were hired, but the\u00a0money ran out.\u00a0\n\n\"Because we're not rich it was\u00a0really hard. Investigations take a lot of time and money.\"\n\nThe justice system has also not been\u00a0listening, not paying attention, not helping, because they don't have the resources, she said.\u00a0\n\n\"And even if they did, remember we're not prioritized. We're Indigenous and that is the hard core reality.\u00a0I don't gloss over anything. I speak my truth and that is my truth.\n\n\"I don't mean to offend anybody. I don't mean to discourage anybody. But I only have to share from my own experience.\"\n\nThe missing are not being found, and more Indigenous people continue to go missing, she said.\u00a0\n\n\"Just in my community, there are 42 people who are missing, both men and women, from a community of about 15,000,\" said Violet about just the cases that she knew about in Maskwacis.\n\nTwo more Red Dress Day ceremonies will be held in Red Deer on May 5.\u00a0\n\nWe Walk to Remember All MMIP event begins at 8 a.m. at the Common Ground Garden Project, 5581 45 St. Participants will walk\u00a0to join\u00a0the event in City Hall Park which begins at noon.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u2014 with files from The Canadian Press\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n\nAbout the Author: Susan Zielinski\n\nSusan has been with the Red Deer Advocate since 2001.

Host Waneek Horn-Miller sums up the significance of dance: \u201cDance has always been an integral part of our ceremonies and traditions. It expresses our prayers, and our mythology, it celebrates our victories, and is a way to heal.\u201d\n\nHowever, colonization nearly destroyed dance. Policy forced dance underground, yet it survived and is seeing a resurgence across the land. Briana Olson, Manager, iHuman Youth Society, explains, \u201cOur ceremonies were related, and central, and fully immersed in how we raised our children, how we engaged in trade, and through our language was how we were directly connected with how we viewed our land.\u201d But to the colonizers, dance was viewed as a threat to the values they held. Thus the settlers created policy to ensure language, ceremonies and sacred dances were all banned. This form of colonization has facilitated\u00c2\u00a0 the culture of shame that, for many Indigenous people, has become a way of being.\n\nKaren J. Pheasant, Cultural Knowledge Keeper, also speaks to the tradition and importance of dance in Indigenous culture: \u201cWe always gave first and foremost recognition to the powers that be, that brought these to us and we gave them with ceremony which was song, which was offerings, and celebrate the good life. What enabled us to do that was through our dance.\u201d\n\nJames Jones, is a self described fusion dancer who, following a career altering knee injury, combined hip-hop with traditional dance styles. James, the official dancer with the popular band A Tribe Called Red, describes dancing as \u201cfood for the spirit.\u201d When not touring, he has\u00c2\u00a0 been leading youth workshops, sharing his own experiences with multi-generational trauma and how that journey has affected his life. James was able to overcome personal tragedy and in so doing claims he was healed by the power of Hoop Dancing.\n\nOne interesting final note with respect to this episode: in the segment about James\u2019 life in gangs on the streets of Edmonton,\u00c2\u00a0 there are a series of shots edited in, but never directly addressed. We see images from the Red Dress Campaign. This campaign was designed to draw attention to the plight of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls across Canada.\n\nYou can read more about James Jones here at WIOT Zine.\n\nOverall, this season has\u00c2\u00a0 been incredibly instructive. Each episode, each facet explored, demonstrates how pervasive colonization has penetrated the lives of Indigenous people. If you are a student or a teacher wanting to understand colonization, particularly in light of the recent TRC Report and its Calls to Action, or if perhaps you are looking to add more content to your Social Studies units I HIGHLY recommend watching this season in its entirety. When viewed together, you get a real sense of the over arcing scope government and policy have played in the lives of Indigenous people in Canada. Additionally, there is a wealth of resources that could easily be adapted for classroom activities, located in the link listed above.\n\nA TRIBE CALLED REDCOLONIZATIONEDUCATIONHIPHOPHOOP DANCINGIHUMANJAMES JONESMISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMENMMIWRED DRESS CAMPAIGNSOCIAL STUDIESTRC REPORT\nCATEGORIES\nSelect Category\n19-2\n21 Thunder\nAcceptable Risk\nActing Good\nAftermath\nAlbedo\nAlias Grace\nAllegiance\nAmazing Race Canada\nAnne\nAnne of Green Gables\nAnne with an E\nAnother Life\nAscension\nAstrid & Lilly Save the World\nBachelor Canada\nBachelorette Canada\nBad Blood\nBaroness von Sketch Show\nBattle of the Generations\nBecause News\nBellevue\nBetween\nBig Brother Canada\nBirder Murder Mysteries\nBitten\nBlackstone\nBletchley Circle: San Francisco\nBlood and Water\nBon Cop, Bad Cop\nBones of Crows\nBook of Negroes\nBria Mack Gets a Life\nBurden of Truth\nCall Me Fitz\nCanada\u2019s Drag Race\nCanada\u2019s Got Talent\nCanada\u2019s Smartest Person\nCanada\u2019s Ultimate Challenge\nCanada: The Story of Us\nCardinal\nCarter\nCaught\nCavendish\nChildren Ruin Everything\nChildren\u2019s Programming\nContinuum\nCorner Gas\nCorner Gas Animated\nCorner Gas: Animated\nCoroner\nCrawford\nCross Country Cake Off\nDark Matter\nDead Still\nDegrassi\nDeparture\nDiggstown\nDigital Series\nDon\u2019t Even\nDragons\u2019 Den\nEssex County\nET Canada\nFamily Feud Canada\nFamily Law\nFeudal\nFool Canada\nForgive Me\nFortunate Son\nFour in the Morning\nFrankie Drake\nFrankie Drake Mysteries\nFrontier\nFubar\nGame shows\nGhost Walk\nGhost Wars\nGhosting with Luke Hutchie and Matthew Finlan\nGoing Native\nGreat Canadian Baking Show\nGreenfields\nHard Rock Medical\nHaven\nHeartland\nHelix\nHolly Hobbie\nHoudini & Doyle\nHow to Fail as a Popstar\nHudson & Rex\nHumour Resources\nI Have Nothing\nIron Chef Canada\nJann\nJonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell\nKilljoys\nKim\u2019s Convenience\nKnights of Panterra\nLady Dicks\nLate Bloomer\nLaw & Order Toronto: Criminal Intent\nLetterkenny\nLittle Bird\nLittle Dog\nLittlekenny\nLost Girl\nMacy Murdoch\nMary Kills People\nMasterchef Canada\nMichael: Every Day\nMichael: Tuesdays and Thursdays\nMirage\nMohawk Girls\nMoonshine\nMotive\nMr. D\nMurdoch Mysteries\nNetflix\nNew Eden\nNorthern Rescue\nNurses\nObituary\nOne More Time\nOpen Heart\nOrphan Black\nPackage Deal\nPlan B\nPlayed\nPretty Hard Cases\nPrivate Eyes\nPure\nPush\nRansom\nReBoot: The Guardian Code\nRecipe to Riches\nReginald the Vampire\nRemedy\nRepublic of Doyle\nRex\nRick Mercer Report\nRobyn Hood\nRoll With It\nRookie Blue\nRope\nRun the Burbs\nRussell Peters is the Indian Detective\nSaint-Pierre\nSatisfaction\nSaving Hope\nSchitt\u2019s Creek\nSecond Jen\nSeed\nSensitive Skin\nShelved\nShoot the Messenger\nShoresy\nSight Unseen\nSkymed\nSlasher\nSome Assembly Required\nSon of a Critch\nSort Of\nSpun Out\nStill Standing\nStrange Empire\nStrays\nStreet Legal\nSullivan\u2019s Crossing\nSunnyside\nSuper Team Canada\nSurrealEstate\nTall Pines\nTallboyz\nThe Beachcombers Animated\nThe Beaverton\nThe Brigade\nThe Code\nThe Council\nThe Detail\nThe Detectives\nThe Disappearance\nThe Good Stuff with Mary Berg\nThe Goods\nThe Hardy Boys\nThe Imperfects\nThe Indian Detective\nThe Kids in the Hall\nThe Lake\nThe Launch\nThe Listener\nThe Murders\nThe Nature of Things\nThe North Water\nThe Order\nThe Pinkertons\nThe Porter\nThe Romeo Section\nThe Sounds\nThe Spencer Sisters\nThe Squeaky Wheel: Canada\nThe Trades\nThe Transplant\nThe Trickster\nThe Wedding Planners\nThis Hour Has 22 Minutes\nThis Life\nThree Pines\nTop Chef Canada\nTrailer Park Boys\nTransplant\nTravelers\nTribal\nTrickster\nTV Movie\nU.S. Series\nUndercover\nUnsettled\nUnspeakable\nVagrant Queen\nVan Helsing\nVideo Games\nVikings\nVollies\nWeb series\nWhat Would Sal Do?\nWhen Calls the Heart\nWild Cards\nWong & Winchester\nWorkin\u2019 Moms\nWorking The Engels\nWynonna Earp\nX Company\nYoung Drunk Punk\nYour Morning\nSUBSCRIBE BY EMAIL\nGet a daily digest of posts by email\nRSS FEED\nRSS -

MMIWG2S stands for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and Two-Spirited Peoples.\n\nFaye Myshyniuk, president of the Whitecourt Indigenous Friends Society, said the board had recently met and discussed holding more events. \u201cWe were talking about different events that happen throughout the year. We decided to put together a calendar of all the different Indigenous events that go on because sometimes we forget them.\u201d\n\nAt the recent meeting, someone said they should hold a walk for MMIWG2S. With little time to plan, the group felt it was more important to do the walk and that they could amp up the community\u2019s involvement next year. \u201cWe want to put the awareness out there. It\u2019s a crucial topic that many people don\u2019t know about,\u201d said Myshyniuk.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that people know what it stands for. We just want to honour and remember the missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirited people. It\u2019s an epidemic. It really is.\u201d Those in attendance were asked to wear red, the movement\u2019s signature colour, which is led by a vibrant red dress.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to get red dress pins, but there wasn\u2019t any time for that so we can do that next year,\u201d added Myshyniuk. \u201cOur goal is to be out, where the public can see us and help raise awareness and education of all things related to Indigenous Peoples. That\u2019s why we want to create the calendar. There are quite a few days to remember, like Indigenous Peoples Day, Red Dress Day, Orange Shirt Day, and then there\u2019s another day in October for Indigenous Sisters. We have to remember all of these different days.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, the RCMP acknowledged in a report that more than 1,200 Indigenous women were missing or murdered between 1980 and 2012. However, different Indigenous groups say the number is much higher, closer to 4,000. Underreported violence against Indigenous women and girls is one reason for the disagreement.\n\nThe Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada (NWAC) has sounded the alarm over figures from Statistics Canada that show Indigenous women are dealing with higher rates of violence. Records from 2004 show that Indigenous women fifteen years of age and older were 3.5 times more likely to experience violence than non-Indigenous women. In 2019, Statistics Canada showed that almost one in ten Indigenous women were victims of violence and that from 2015-2020, homicides with Indigenous victims were six times higher than non-Indigenous people.\n\nAn inquiry into the MMIWG was released in 2019. Over 2,300 people participated in the truth-gathering process, and 231 calls to justice were recommended. Fifteen community hearings occurred from September 2016 to 2019, and 1484 family members and survivors shared their gut-wrenching testimonies.\n\nHighway 16 in BC, near Prince George, is called the Highway of Tears by many. The 724 km stretch of the Yellowhead highway has been the site of many Indigenous victims. Twenty-three First Nations border the highway and the lack of public transportation results in high rates of hitchhiking. Human Rights Watch, a non-governmental organization focused on advocacy and research on human rights issues, said BC had the highest rate in Canada of unsolved murders of Indigenous women and girls.\n\nIn September last year, a monument was erected on Highway 16 called \u201cJourney of Hope.\u201d The memorial is of a red dress with an Indigenous dancer silhouetted in front of it. It stands atop a pole, visible to all who drive by. The monument was initiated by the Prince George\u2019s Red Dress Society.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an epidemic. There have been calls to action for so many years about this, and now people are listening. Before, those calls to action were largely ignored. Finally, in 2016, when they did the National Inquiry into this, it made it very clear that Canada has a problem and that Indigenous people are paying for it,\u201d said Myshyniuk.\n\nShe added that spreading awareness, just like the monument on the Highway of Tears, is a massive part of the conversation. \u201cIt leads along the path to truth and reconciliation. My biggest thing is that we can all be together as one nation and work together towards a better future for all mankind. None of this segregation and stuff like that. I think it\u2019s important for us to all work together as one.\u201d\n\nAround forty people took part in the walk, which ran the perimeter of Festival Park Pond. \u201cIt\u2019s a day of mourning, honouring, and taking action to end the violence, which is so important to me. Not only for the Indigenous women and the atrocities being largely ignored for all these years, but it also has much to do with domestic violence. That\u2019s one thing that I am very set against. This fits right in with that. I\u2019m really happy that several ladies from Wellspring will be joining us.\u201d\n\nMyshyniuk said she hopes that people who don\u2019t know about the issue will look into it and learn more about it. \u201cYou owe it to yourselves, and you owe it to these victims to educate yourselves and learn more about it. They didn\u2019t just die for no reason.

According to the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, 67 per of the hundreds of disappearances have been murders, while 20 per cent are disappearances where the missing are never heard from again.\n\nVigils and ceremonies to remember the missing are held regularly in many communities across the country, particularly in areas with large Indigenous populations. But this will be the first such event to be organized in Cornwall by the wellness centre.\n\n\u201cWe brainstormed to come up with ideas for how to try to raise awareness and get this issue out there. We had a contact at the Port Theatre and he was available that day, so we decided to bring it to Cornwall,\u201d explained Kathleen Terrance, another organizer.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nOverall, Indigenous women in Canada are much more at risk of going missing than their male counterparts, there are also Akwesasne 24 men who have gone over the past several years as well. In light of this, the wellness centre felt that the event would make a point of including the missing men as well.\n\n\u201cAs mothers, we are our sons\u2019 voice, and so we decided we would add men into our event,\u201d said Square. \u201cWe want to remember them as well.\u201d\n\nThe red dress is has been used as a symbol for the missing and murdered Indigenous women because of the dress\u2019 association with women and red being the colour of their life\u2019s blood.\n\nThe dresses that will be hung on lamp posts from the international bridge to all the way to St. Lawrence College were collected from multiple sources. Somewhere donated by community members, others came from Maison Baldwin House\u2019s Serendipity Boutique, and the Salvation Army.\n\nahale@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/alan_s_hale\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\nLATEST NATIONAL STORIES\nNEWS NEAR CORNWALL"},

Transportation Minister Todd Stone announced that bus service would begin in the area by the end of the year.\n\nChief Joseph Bevan of the Kitselas First Nation near Terrace said he\u2019s part of an advisory group concerned about the safety of people along the 750-kilometre route and that it came together for regular meetings last November after months of discussions.\n\nHe said it\u2019s common for people to take a risk and hitchhike in the notorious area because they\u2019re too poor to take the train or a Greyhound bus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s non-aboriginals as well. It\u2019s everyone who is on social assistance, people with disabilities, who are having trouble moving around. It makes them vulnerable when they\u2019re jumping into a vehicle with somebody else.\u201d\n\nBevan said that at a meeting in March, a Via Rail official made the proposal to offer a $5 fare along the highway that stretches between Prince Rupert and Prince George.\n\nMichael Woelcke, the railway\u2019s general manager for remote services, said in minutes of the meeting held in Prince George on March 30 that the company would offer the low fare \u201cregardless of origin or destination along the route.\u201d\n\nSunrise\n\nStart your day with a roundup of B.C.-focused news and opinion.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nHe said Via Rail provides train service three times a week between Prince Rupert and Prince George, and it\u2019s open to suggestions on determining eligibility for the $5 fare that would be available to \u201cat risk\u201d and \u201cvulnerable\u201d people including youth and \u201celders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to identify who would qualify for this program, as we cannot provide everyone with these reduced fares,\u201d he said in the minutes.\n\nWoelcke said a minimum $75 one-way fare would be reduced by a third for aboriginal passengers.\n\nWoelcke was not available for comment, and the company said an official would provide details if and when an arrangement is worked out with the province.\n\nVia Rail said in an emailed statement that a discounted fare for \u201cvulnerable\u201d people is one of the options being studied and that discussions with the Transportation Ministry and the advisory group are ongoing.\n\nThe ministry said interconnectivity of services along Highway 16 has been part of discussions and that Via Rail was included to determine what role it could play to increase transportation options.\n\n\u201cWe continue to engage with Via Rail on the idea of offering a discounted train fare to vulnerable First Nations people,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe group is slated to meet again next month.\n\nAs for the promised new bus service between Prince George and Prince Rupert, the ministry said the first of more than 20 public information sessions hosted by BC Transit will start Saturday.\n\nBC Transit said Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, which is part of the advisory group, has provided $1 million in funding for features including enhanced bus stop shelters and CCTV cameras to ensure passengers\u2019 safety along the corridor.\n\nThe route provides the main transportation link to and from remote First Nations villages located off the main highway.\n\nMost of the cases of murdered and missing women remain unsolved, but police have said it\u2019s believed that more than one killer is involved.\n\n\u2014 Follow @CamilleBains1 on Twitter.\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nRoofers Tested 17 Gutter Guards\u2026 Here\u2019s What They Discovered\nThe Actual Cost of Gutter Guards in 2024 May Surprise You\nLeafFilter Partner\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nBikers' sentencing delayed by Indigenous connections claim\nVancouver Sun\nBoy, 15, fatally attacked while walking dog with mom in north Edmonton, man in custody\nVancouver Sun\nStop scratching these, and try this instead\nDaily Pulse\n|\nSponsored\nStop scanning your lottery ticket, do this instead\nDaily Pulse\n|\nSponsored\nCanadians Born 1944 - 1983 Could Get This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nHeart Surgeon Shares 3 Min Routine For Daily Bowel Movements\nGundry MD\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\n\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

And at that point if they were to set foot on reserve, they should have been removed by law enforcement and charged for trespassing,\u201d said Chief Ross Perley.\n\nChief Perley is frustrated with law enforcement, but also with provincial and federal governments. He believes had decision-makers worked with the community to enforce their laws, Sabattis might be alive today.\n\n\u201cAll of our communities have been calling on law enforcement to do a better job at drug enforcement in our communities.

Citizen photo by Brent Braaten June 21 2016Brent Braaten, Photographer\n\nUnder the branches of a Cottonwood Kym Gouchie spoke of the surroundings that inspired her latest song - a chant that reflects a local woman's efforts to cleanse the Highway of Tears.\n\n\"It felt like it came from the trees, it felt like it came from the ground and it came from the sky and it just filled the drum and the voice filled the space I was walking it,\" said Gouchie as the National Aboriginal Day entertainment thrummed in the background.\n\nGouchie joined Brenda Wilson-John on the last leg of her long journey from Prince Rupert to Prince George along Highway 16. During one five-kilometre stretch, the Lheidli T'enneh singer brought her drum.\n\n\"All of my songs come from a place that is beyond my conscious level,\" she said.\n\nThrough the minute-long song, Gouchie chants on repeat: \"We are cleansing the Highway of Tears, as we walk, as we walk.\"\n\nIt started as an incantation on the road but the song came together Sunday on the river bank, where she sat with Wilson-John and the Khast'an Drummers, who also played the song.\n\n\"Fluidly it all came together,\" said Gouchie, adding it had special meaning that Wilson-John helped finalize the piece.\n\n\"We sat down and she said this was the song that came to me,\" recalled Wilson-John, who walked more than 700 kilometres in memory of her sister, Ramona Wilson. \"First it was just the chant. It was just amazing and I was like 'Yes, that's it.'\n\n\"It's very simple and right to the point and it is very powerful at the same time.\"\n\nThe song is exudes both sadness and strength.\n\n\"Right now it's a victory, it's a success, it's a celebration, it's National Aboriginal Day, but if we were to be singing this in any other situation it would have a much sadder tone to it,\" Gouchie said. \"Having (Wilson-John) walk on the stage in her little fluorescent vest, it was very emotional but it was also very empowering... It just shows how strong we are as a people and especially as women.\"\n\nMusic is the best medium to speak to that dichotomy, both to honour the missing and murdered and empower those who remain.\n\n\"It's universal,\" said Gouchie. \"It's like a smile. Music can heal a heart. Music, especially when you have a drum and you have your voice, is the highest form of prayer.\"\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nReport a mistake\nThis has not been shared.

Black said her project, which has a haunting visual effect, aims to draw greater public attention to the issue of missing and murdered aboriginal women.\n\n\"I figured a way to do that was through my art work,\" Black said.\n\nCalls for a national inquiry on murdered and missing aboriginal women have been growing since the RCMP revealed last year that nearly 1,200 aboriginal women have been murdered or gone missing in Canada in the last 30 years.\n\nOn Sunday, Black is hoping to draw even more attention to the issue by opening up her project to the public. She is inviting Canadians to display their own red dresses to signal their support of indigenous women.\n\nThe striking, one-day display of red dresses will coincide with the National Day of Vigils to Remember Murdered and Missing Aboriginal Women.\n\n\"I'm hoping that the public can support indigenous women by displaying a red dress in their home or business, or coming together as a community and displaying red dresses in other public places,\" Black said.\n\nAsked why she chose the colour red, Black said it is a \"very important sacred colour\" -- not only for her, personally, but for many other indigenous groups across Canada as well.\n\nBlack said a friend of hers, who is also an aboriginal, explained that red was the only colour sprits could see.\n\n\"So (red) is really a calling back of the spirits of these women and allowing them a chance to be among us and have their voices heard through their family members and community,\" she said.\n\nBlack said she hopes her project will inspire local organizations to launch similar projects in the future.\n\n\"I'm hoping that community groups will take on and start doing public installations and using that as a tool to have the public have more of an understanding of missing and murdered women.\"\n\nRELATED IMAGES\n\nREDress Project creator Jaime Black is hoping to draw even more attention to the issue of missing and murdered aboriginal women by opening up her project to the public.

Courtesy photo\nShare\n \nTweet\n \nEmail\n\nNews release\u00a0\n\nThe Zonta Club of Santa Clarita Valley aims to\u00a0spread awareness of murdered and missing indigenous women and its true meaning plus the awareness of all murdered and missing individuals. \u00a0\n\nAt various local events, as part of the Red Dress Project, the club is displaying dresses and a sweater representing the eight murdered individuals here locally from 2015 to 2017. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe constantly hear of another individual that was taken from us too soon,\u201d the club said in a news release. \u201cAll violence must cease.\u00a0Explaining the importance of this project will hopefully bring awareness that we must as a community work together to prevent this from continuing to happen.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThirty-five percent of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence, the release said. Native American/Alaskan or Native Hawaiians make up 1% of our local population but 25% more have suffered than other races when it comes to violence against women. \u201cWe shall not rest until women\u2019s rights are recognized\u00a0as human rights,\u201d the club\u2019s statement said.\u00a0\n\nOn Feb. 24, Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta delivered an announcement that two new resources for law enforcement will be provided from their office regarding violence against women. Reducing violent crimes against women has become the top priority of the Department of Justice. \u00a0\n\nOne, a new tool to help law enforcement agencies best respond to, investigate, and ultimately prevent domestic violence and intimate partner violence by delivering innovative and evolving training and technical assistance to grantees in a more efficient, effective manner. Also, a national resource center is being established, specifically designed to help areas prevent domestic violence homicides. \u00a0\n\n\u201cBy continuing the SCV Red Dress Project in spring, it allows the Zonta Club of Santa Clarita Valley to bring awareness so we may continue our mission, Zonta Says NO: Violence Against Women,\u201d the statement said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYou can support the Zonta Club of Santa Clarita Valley by attending one of the dates this spring where they\u00a0will be displaying the SCV Red Dress Project. With your donation, you may receive a \u201cZonta Says NO\u201d bracelet or pin, or an SCV Red Dress button or grocery bag.\u00a0\n\nThe Red Dress will be appearing at local libraries, community centers, College of the Canyons, City Hall, the Saugus Swap Meet, and at the Newhall Farmers Market. It started on Women\u2019s Day, March 8, and will continue until the National Red Dress Day, May 5.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMay 5 has been known as the Red Dress Day since 2010 in North America. It was created for the awareness of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.\u00a0Red Dresses will hang throughout our nation and Canada to raise awareness.\u00a0The Zonta Club of Santa Clarita Valley supports this day in honor of all indigenous and all women who have been murdered or are missing. \u00a0\n\nYou can check Zonta\u2019s website for the full schedule and the story of the SCV Red Dress Project at www.SCVZonta.org/advocacy.\u00a0\n\nNews Release\nThe Signal delivers press releases from reliable sources to provide up-to-the-minute information to our website readers.

She\u2019ll present a Vancouver Island Regional virtual author talk on April 30. (VIRL/Contributed)\nListen to this article\n00:02:00\n\nAngela Sterritt, an award-winning investigative journalist and national bestselling author of \u201cUnbroken,\u201d will join the Vancouver Island Regional Library for a virtual talk on the poignant issues faced by Indigenous women and girls.\n\nSterritt\u2019s book, which is part memoir and part investigation into the murders and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls, became an instant national bestseller and is nominated for the Hilary Weston Writers\u2019 Trust Award for best non-fiction book in Canada.\n\n\u201cHaving Angela with us just days ahead of Red Dress Day on May 5 is a powerful tribute to the many Indigenous women and girls who have been victims of a system that has failed them,\u201d says VIRL librarian Dalia Levy. \u201cIt is important for everyone to hear Angela\u2019s personal stories and the stories she has reported on.\u201d\n\nSterritt is from the Wilp Wiik\u2019aax of the Gitanmaax community within the Gitxsan Nation on her father\u2019s side and from Bell Island, Newfoundland, on her mother\u2019s side. She worked as a television, radio, and digital journalist at CBC for more than a decade, hosted the award-winning CBC original podcast \u201cLand Back,\u201d and lives on the territories of the Skwxwu7mesh, Musqueam, and Tsleil-Waututh in Vancouver.\n\nParticipants attending the virtual talk, scheduled for Tuesday, April 30, from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., are advised to prepare for a session that will address trauma, systemic racism, and potentially triggering themes. The Indigenous Crisis Line will be available 24/7 toll-free at 1-800-588-8717 across B.C. to provide support for those affected.\n\nThis event is free.

(Erin Christie/Morning Star)\n\nErin Christie\n\nMorning Star Staff\n\nPeople have told Stephanie Killman that the pain of losing a loved one can fade with time, but she and her sisters, Harmony and Alicia have felt it everyday since their mother\u2019s murder last November.\n\n\u201cI was the one who found her \u2014it was the worst day of my life.\u201d\n\nHer mother, Treena Marie Ball, 46 was found dead in her home on Nov. 18, 2016. The body of her partner, Don Wayne Ball, 68, was also found in the house. According to an RCMP report a single firearm was used and the incident was confirmed by RCMP as a \u201cmurder-suicide,\u201d and there was no evidence to indicate third-party involvement.\n\n\u201cI knew the minute I got there that something wasn\u2019t right. I walked into the house and I was calling and calling and no one was answering,\u201d Killman recalled.\n\nAs the only family member with an extra set of keys to her mother\u2019s Spruce Crescent home in Enderby, Killman, 27, said she went to the house that day because her stepfather\u2019s kids asked her to \u201ccheck on things\u201d after learning he hadn\u2019t shown up for work that morning.\n\n\u201cHe murdered her, and then he killed himself,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe never saw them fighting or had any inkling that something might be wrong. But you never know what goes on behind closed doors.\u201d\n\nAlicia Killman, 29, echoed her younger sister, adding that as far as she knew, life at home had been \u201cnormal\u201d for her mother, and she was happy.\n\n\u201cMy mom was known around Enderby \u2014 everyone loved her,\u201d Alicia said, \u201cShe was caring and thoughtful. She wore her heart on her sleeve, and people loved that about her. I loved that about her. I think her [funeral] was one of the biggest celebrations of life I had ever seen around here.\u201d\n\nOver the past year, Killman says she and her family have struggled to cope with the loss of their mother as they learn more about the events that led to her death.\n\n\u201cI was the one who found her \u2014it was the worst day of my life.\u201d\n\n- Stephanie Killman\n\n\u201cWe heard later that she went to our band for help, to try and get out\u2026.It\u2019s hard enough to put yourself in the vulnerable position of asking for help in a situation like that\u2026I can\u2019t imagine how she must have felt.\u201d\n\nKillman says she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable describing the \u201chorrific\u201d scene that greeted her when she entered her mother\u2019s home that day, but feels it\u2019s important to share what she can in the hope that others will \u201clearn something,\u201d from her mother\u2019s story, and take action.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still not really comfortable talking to people outside our circle of family and friends about what happened, but I\u2019m trying because it\u2019s important to get the message out into the world, not just our small community, that this stuff happens. That it\u2019s real, and it doesn\u2019t just happen where people think. It happens close to home.\u201d\n\nFor the Killmans, part of getting their message out means participating in events like The Red Dress Walk for Awareness, an annual event held to raise awareness for the untold numbers of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls across Canada. During these events, members of the public are asked to wear a red dress or to display a red dress in a public place as a symbol of hope and an acknowledgement that missing and murdered women have not been forgotten.\n\nIn Enderby, the event took place Wednesday along the shore of the Shuswap River near the Enderby Bridge, and was attended by approximately 50 people. Deanna Cook, who has organized Enderby\u2019s Red Dress Walk for the past two years, says in a small, close-knit community like hers, this particular subject hits close to home.\n\n\u201cIn the last two years we have had five women taken from our community. Two were murdered and three are still missing in our community,\u201d Cook said Wednesday morning, referring to Caitlin Potts, Ashley Simpson and Deanna Wertz.\n\n\u201cWe have these events to remember those who are missing, and to remind people to keep looking for these women \u2014 people need to know that they will not be forgotten,\u201d she said.\n\nCaitlin Potts, 27, was last seen in February, 2016. The Cree mother from Alberta was reportedly in B.C., sorting out a troubled relationship with her ex-boyfriend when she went missing. B.C. RCMP released footage of the young woman entering Orchard Park Mall in Kelowna, from a surveillance video taken on Feb. 21, 2016. It\u2019s the last time she was seen. Ashley Simpson, 27, was last seen on April 27 of last year. Deanna Wertz, 46,was last seen in the early morning of July 19, 2016 at her residence on Yankee Flats Road.\n\nAccording to data published by the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, Indigenous women made up three per cent of the country\u2019s female population in 2008, but suffered roughly 10 per cent of all female homicides that year. More than half of the cases occurred in the western provinces, with British Columbia and Alberta home to the highest numbers.\n\nThis year, Cook added, Red Dress walks took on additional meaning against the backdrop of the hearings that took place at the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, held this summer.\n\nWhile the Red Dress Project, on which the walk is based, was initially created seven years ago by Jaime Black, a Metis artist from Winnipeg, to draw attention to missing and murdered Indigenous women specifically, Cook says she has broadened the scope of Enderby\u2019s walk to include \u201call women.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll women deserve to be safe in our communities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to get the message that girls, all girls, need to stay safe. You can\u2019t just walk down the road at night anymore. And we\u2019re here trying to get the message out there that we should be able walk alone and not be afraid\u2014that the way things are right now, is not OK.\u201d\n\nTo see more photos of the Red Dress Walk for Awareness, and learn more about the event, click below.\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tRCMP respond to report of 30-person fight at Salmon Arm grad party\n\t\tOutdoor enthusiasts get Salmon Arm hiking group climbing in numbers\n\t\tMulti-vehicle crash closes Highway 97A between Sicamous and Enderby\n\t\tShuswap author introduces public to her Foraging way of life\n\t\tSalmon Arm man marks 65th birthday with return to rock\nFacebook Comments (0) \nMan dies trying to save 2 dogs from drowning in Okanagan Falls\nBlack Press Media\nSalmon Arm RCMP catch break-and-enter suspect in the act of cleaning\nBlack Press Media\nUse This and Never Have to Change Your Whipper Snipper Line Again\nUltraCut\n|\nSponsored\nEdmonton: Small Prefab Houses For Seniors At Lowest Prices Ever\nGoSearches\n|\nSponsored\nThis Is More Powerful Than Pressure Washers and Uses No Energy (It's Genius)\nPowerJet\n|\nSponsored\nRCMP respond to report of 30-person fight at Salmon Arm grad party\nBlack Press Media\nSicamous man charged with 2nd degree murder of local woman\nBlack Press Media\nDiscover the Last Trimmer Head You\u2019ll Ever Need\nUltraCut\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nHang A Bag Of Water With Pennies Outside Your Front Door\nLifeHackGuru\n|\nSponsored\nThese Unsold Alaska Cruise Cabin Deals Will Leave You Speechless (See Prices)\nDiscover Discounts & Savings On Unsold Alaskan Cruises With These Searches.\nFavorite Searches\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nKelowna's Shady Rest Fish and Chip shop reopens after tragic death\nBlack Press Media\nSilencers intercepted at Vancouver airport leads to Sicamous arrest\nBlack Press Media\nYOUR VOTE MATTERS\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nWhat do you think is the most critical challenge facing the youth today?\n Mental health\n Education and employment opportunities\n Social media influence\n Peer pressure and bullying\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nTODAY IN B.C.\nEnvironment Canada issues multiple warnings as B.C. braces for weekend heat\nSouth Okanagan school district sued over alleged 2018 student assault\nMajor blasting complete at site of rockslide near Summerland\nHeat sparks North Okanagan fire hazard warning\nNew hotel slated for Summerland\nMore from Today In BC >\n \nSalmon Arm Observer\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nAdvertising\nSupport Centre\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nJoin our Team\nNews\nLocal News\nNewsletters\nSubscribe\nToday in BC\nCanadian News\nWorld News\nEntertainment\nSports\nBusiness\nTrending Now\nOpinion\nSubmit News Tips\nNeighbours\nEagle Valley News\nRevelstoke Times Review\nVernon Morning Star\nKelowna Capital News\nKeremeos Review\nLake Country Calendar\nPenticton Western News\nSimilkameen Review\nSummerland Review\nWest K News\nMore\nOur Community\nPublic Notices\nVideo\nPhoto Galleries\nWest Coast Traveller\nCannabis\nToday's Home\nPodcasts\nFood\nLife\nContact Us\nTravel\nContests\nPuzzles\nContests\nShop\nImpress Stories\nSavvy Shopper\nReal Estate\nImpress TV\nAdd Your Business\nE-Editions\nClassifieds\nAll Classifieds\nBook a Print Ad\nAuto\nToday's Drive\nAuto Showcase\nJobs\nLocalWork\nJoin Our Team\nObituaries\nCelebrations of Life\nFuneral Care Services\nIn Memory\nPlace an Obituary\nGood News\nLocal Good News\nSocial Media\nSalmon Arm Live\nToday in BC\nYoutube\nI love British Columbia\nI love Alberta\nI love Nunavut\nI love Yukon\nI love Northwest Territories\n\u00a9 2024 Salmon Arm Observer and Black Press Media Publications Contact"},

(Erika Gilbuena photo)\nListen to this article\n00:02:50\n\nBy Erika Gilbeuena\n\nFor the Stettler Independent\n\nGrade 10-12 students of Coronation School and Castor\u2019s Gus Wetter School, along with the Grade 10 students of Wm E.Hay Stettler Secondary Campus attended a play titled Blood\u2013 A Story of Reconciliation, which captures the story of surviving through residential schools and moments in history that changed the traditional way of life for the Blackfoot people.\n\nThe Indigenous musical/dance production graced the stage of Stettler Performing Arts Center to reveal the traditions and stories that were taken away from the Blackfoot people when they were placed in reservations back in the late 1800s. Deanne Bertsch, the director of the play, began the evening by recounting the events that encouraged her to stage it.\n\nAccompanied by a fusion of Blackfoot and contemporary music by Peter Gabriel, the show unfolded with Eulalia, a Blackfoot elder and an educator at Strathmore High School, reading the poem by Chief Dan George Words to a Grandchild while she watched the scenes that played out based on the events she witnessed herself. Along with Eulalia was Eddie Wolf Child, Chris Eagle Rib, who played the drums and the flute, and Sho Blunderfield, who provided the vocals.\n\n\u201cShe (Eulalia) wanted hope and healing to be the big focus of the show. So we started creating the show around those moments,\u201d said Bertsch.\n\nAmong the audience was Warren Aspenes, Clearview Division Principal, who explained that Clearview Public Schools sponsored \u201cNew Blood\u201d to let the community see history and to be able to partake in it.\n\n\u201dThe play is relevant since the Red Dress Day (National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and Two-Spirit People) is approaching,\u201d commented Nancy Aspenes, who attended the event with her husband.\n\nAfter receiving a standing ovation, Bertsch invited the crowd to stay for a talk-back session where the cast and crews answered questions from the spectators.\n\nThey discussed the origin and significance of the costumes, notably their regalias. The actresses revealed that the majority of the symbols that were embedded in their dresses were their family\u2019s emblems that were passed down from generation to generation.\n\nThey also discussed the symbolism shown in the performance.\n\nOne of the messages that the show conveyed was that the failure of the past should not impede the progress we are making toward national unity and understanding.\n\n\u201cWe can make reconciliation happen at the little corner of our homes,\u201d Bertch added.\n\n\u201cNew Blood\u201d is scheduled to perform next at Living Sky Casino in Saskatchewan on May 14, 2024.\n\nNew Blood- A Story of Reconciliation tells the story of survival in Canada\u2019s residential school system.\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tStettler man takes to the road to raise money for a local specialty ranch\n\t\t'Old-style country fair' held in Red Willow\n\t\tAlberta man charged after teen shot, wounded on his rural property\n\t\tPaintearth County announces internet partnership\n\t\tTrudeau missing Calgary Stampede this summer, his only absence outside COVID-19 years\nFacebook Comments (0) \nKiller of Calgary man dies while in B.C. prison\nBlack Press Media\nTornado touches down near Halkirk\nBlack Press Media\nCanadians Born 1944-1983 Could Get This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nUnsold 2024-2025 Alaska Cruise Cabins May Be Cheaper Than You Think\nDiscover Discounts & Savings On Unsold Alaskan Cruises With These Searches.\nFavorite Searches\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\n4 Ways to Retire Comfortably With $500K in Canada\nFisher Investments Canada\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\n4 charged in massive Camrose stolen property seizure\nBlack Press Media\nSevere thunderstorm watch issued for parts of Central Alberta\nBlack Press Media\nCanadians Born 1944-1984 Could Apply For This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nThe Best Way To See Alaska Is By Cruise - Explore All-Inclusive Offers\nDiscover Discounts & Savings On Unsold Alaskan Cruises With These Searches.\nFavorite Searches\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nThese Unsold Alaska Cruise Cabin Deals Will Leave You Speechless (See Prices)\nDiscover Discounts & Savings On Unsold Alaskan Cruises With These Searches.\nFavorite Searches\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nAlberta man charged after teen shot, wounded on his rural property\nBlack Press Media\n'Old-style country fair' held in Red Willow\nBlack Press Media\nYOUR VOTE MATTERS\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nWhat do you think is the most critical challenge facing the youth today?\n Mental health\n Education and employment opportunities\n Social media influence\n Peer pressure and bullying\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nTODAY IN ALBERTA\nPonoka man joins the Great Cycle Challenge Canada to help fight kids' cancer \nAHS: Stay safe and prevent injuries this summer\nAlberta RCMP reminds residents of the 9 p.m. routine\nMan dead after falling from equipment during Canada Day parade: Alberta RCMP\nWildfire burns out of control near Suncor\u2019s Firebag oilsands site\nMore from Today in Alberta >\n \nThe Stettler Independent\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nAdvertising\nSupport Centre\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nJoin our Team\nNews\nLocal News\nNewsletters\nSubscribe\nAlberta\nNational\nWorld News\nOpinion\nSubmit News Tips\nNeighbours\nLacombe Express\nRimbey Review\nSylvan Lake News\nEckville Echo\nPonoka News\nBashaw Star\nPipestone Flyer\nCastor Advance\nMore\nOur Community\nPublic Notices\nVideo\nPhoto Galleries\nTravel\nWest Coast Traveller\nCannabis\nPodcasts\nFood\nLife\nContact Us\nContests\nPuzzles\nContests\nShop\nImpress Stories\nSavvy Shopper\nReal Estate\nImpress TV\nAdd Your Business\nE-Editions\nClassifieds\nAll Classifieds\nPost a Print Ad\nItems for Sale\nGarage Sales\nJobs\nLocal Work\nObituaries\nCelebrations of Life\nFuneral Care Services\nIn Memory\nPlace an Obituary\n\u00a9 2024 The Stettler Independent and Black Press Media Publications Contact"},

(Submitted)\n\nOn the road again. And again\n\nRobin Edgar Haworth, the Penticton Indian Band\u2019s travelling artist, recently left on his annual summer walking tour.\n\nHaworth, with best friend and companion Koda, the Australian shepherd, are on a journey that will eventually take them along the infamous 720-kilometre corridor of Highway 16 called the Highway of Tears.\n\nThat section of road received the name from a series of murders and disappearances of between 16 and more than 40 Indigenous women.\n\nHaworth attempted the trek last year, however wildfires and smoke forced him to cut short his trip.\n\nREAD ALSO: Penticton artist one month into Right the Wrong trek\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing it for any kind of personal recognition we just love to walk and it\u2019s always in memory of the ones who can\u2019t walk anymore, the murdered and the missing they\u2019re always on my mind,\u201d said Haworth by cell phone just after breaking camp north of Kelowna. \u201cI know I will feel their spirits, I know a couple of them and they\u2019re never far away.\u201d\n\nIn 2015 he did a 4,500-kilometre Right the Wrong trek from Penticton to Ottawa to draw attention to those missing and murdered women.\n\nREAD ALSO: Penticton artist on walk of awareness to Ottawa\n\n\u201cMy sister is one of those people, she\u2019s not missing she was murdered back in the early 70s in Vancouver,\u201d said Haworth. \u201cIt was just another case of a dead Indian found on the street, it wasn\u2019t even investigated.\u201d\n\nThe initial part of his journey, which he expects complete sometime in September, is to Vancouver Island including the archipelago of Haida Gwaii also known as the Queen Charlotte Islands, before returning to the mainland and the Highway of Tears and then home.\n\nWalking continues to be Haworth\u2019s passion and the long journey\u2019s he makes with Koda each year are what he lives for.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re walking along the road and you\u2019ve got no radio on no phone on it\u2019s just you and your dog and it\u2019s peaceful, your mind goes to a place where you can really do a lot of self searching and healing. We all have the little things in the back of our minds that we have to deal with.\u201d\n\nJust over a week in, so far he Koda has not had any unusual experiences, other than one at the Penticton Home Hardware store just before he left.\n\nHe had been telling some of the staff there about his trip and a customer overheard the conversation.\n\n\u201cThe lady said: \u2018oh, you\u2019re going walking, can I give you any money?\u2019 and I said no and she said: \u2018Aren\u2019t you walking because you\u2019re poor?\u2019 and I said \u2018no, I\u2019m walking because I love walking,\u2019\u201d Haworth recalled with a laugh. \u201cAnd right after that another lady came up to me and said; \u2018You\u2019re walking to Haida Gwaii, can I give you some money for your efforts,\u2019 and I said \u2018no ma\u2019am, we\u2019re good.\u2019\u201d\n\nOne part of the journey he is especially looking forward to is in the summer when his daughter Lee Denis will join him from her current home in Perth, Scotland after battling cancer.\n\n\u201cThat will be great, I haven\u2019t seen her for a long time,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd when asked just how much distance he plans to cover on his current adventure, in true Haworth fashion he replied: \u201cI have no idea. What\u2019s that old adage, it\u2019s not about the destination, it\u2019s about the journey and what you learn along the way.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n@PentictonNews\nnewstips@pentictonwesternnews.com\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\n\u00a0MarkBrett\nSend Mark Brett an email.\nLike the Western News on Facebook.\nFollow us on Twitter.\n\nRobin Edgar Haworth and Koda at the start of their 2015 journey to Ottawa.

(Carrier Sekani Child & Family Services photo)\nExpand\n\nFirst Nations leaders and the parents of two missing members of the Saik\u2019uz First Nation are calling for more resources and action to find the missing young people. Indigenous leaders and family spoke at a press conference in Vanderhoof today to request information and action by government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been 24 days since my daughter Chelsea went missing, and we still don\u2019t have any answers,\u201d said a tearful Pam Heron, mother of missing woman Chelsey Quaw (Heron).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying as hard as I can. I have to fight just because his boys deserve to know where he\u2019s at,\u201d said Angie Raphael, mother of missing man Jay Raphael.\n\nChelsey Quaw (Heron) and Jay Preston Raphael are both missing members of the Saik\u2019uz First Nation, located 120 km west of Prince George, just outside Vanderhoof, B.C. and just 14 km south of Highway 16.\n\nHighway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert is known as the Highway of Tears, due to the high number of missing and murdered women in the area, the majority of whom over the years have been Indigenous.\n\nCommunity leaders also shed tears as they spoke at a press conference in Vanderhoof, urging for more resources to be brought to the investigation into the two missing young people.\n\nChief Priscilla Mueller of Saik\u2019uz First Nation thanked all the volunteers who came to participate in the search so far, and said the Saik\u2019uz community had taken the search to Prince George and Vanderhoof as well.\n\nBut she said more needs to be done and more resources are needed.\n\n\u201cThere is only so much the local RCMP can do,\u201d she said, noting they need help from government.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not too sure how we\u2019re going to move forward with the search,\u201d she said.\n\nMary Teegee, executive director of Carrier Sekani Child & Family Service expressed frustration at the lack of action on the 33 recommendations from the 2006 Highway of Tears Symposium Report, which she was also a part of.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m upset that we have to be here again,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere are things we need to think about as a society, how much value are we placing on our Indigenous women, our Indigenous men.\u201d\n\nShe called for more action from both the government, law enforcement and the media to help draw attention to the ongoing issues surrounding missing and murdered Indigenous women and the Highway of Tears. She also referenced the missing women in Manitoba whose remains are believed to be in a landfill.\n\n\u201cIn Canada we\u2019re having to check the landfills for bodies of our missing Indigenous women. Think about that. As a society we have to do better.\u201d\n\nChelsey Quaw is a 29-year-old Indigenous woman with brown hair, brown eyes who vanished from her community last month.\n\nShe stands five feet, 10 inches tall and weighs about 120 pounds. She was possibly wearing blue jeans and a purple winter jacket when she went missing in the early morning hours of Oct. 11, 2023 from a residence on the Saik\u2019uz First Nation.\n\nSeveral search and rescue teams as well as community groups formed search parties to look for Quaw with no results.\n\nJay Preston Raphael has been missing from the community just over eight months.\n\nRaphael is a 28-year-old male with black hair and brown eyes, and unique tattoos on his neck, chest and arm.\n\nHe is five feet, nine inches tall and weighs approximately 143 pounds.\n\nRaphael was last seen on Feb. 25, 2023 at Saik\u2019uz First Nation wearing a black coat, blue jeans black runners and a baseball hat.\n\nSaik\u2019uz First Nation has an on-reserve population of about 400.\n\nLeaders also frequently referenced other missing women from the area. This included Mackie Basil, missing from Tl\u2019azt\u2019en Nation Nation, since 2013, Bonnie Joseph of Yekooche First Nation, missing from near Vanderhoof since 2008, Ramona Wilson of Gitxan First Nation, who went missing in 1994 and whose remains were found near Smithers in 1995. Her murder remains unsolved. They also mentioned Madison Scott and the ongoing search for justice in her case. Scott had been missing since 2011 and her remains were found earlier this year near Vanderhoof, but no charges have yet been laid as the investigation is ongoing.\n\nAnyone with any information can contact Vanderhoof RCMP at 250-567-2222 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.\n\nREAD MORE: Mother of missing Vanderhoof woman says she would never just take off\n\nREAD MORE: RCMP renews public assistance call to locate missing man\n\nREAD MORE: Search continues for missing Vanderhoof woman Chelsey Quaw\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n\nAbout the Author: Ruth Lloyd\n\nI moved back to my hometown of Williams Lake after living away and joined the amazing team at the Williams Lake Tribune in 2021.\nRead more\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tInternist enjoys working in Williams Lake area\n\t\tPHOTOS: 96th Annual Williams Lake Stampede wraps on Canada Day\n\t\tCanada Day celebrated in Boitanio Park in Williams Lake\n\t\tPHOTOS: Day 3 96th annual Williams Lake Stampede done, dusted\n\t\tMen provide some helping hands at Williams Lake community garden\nFacebook Comments (0) \nYOUR VOTE MATTERS\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nWhat do you think is the most critical challenge facing the youth today?\n Mental health\n Education and employment opportunities\n Social media influence\n Peer pressure and bullying\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nTODAY IN B.C.\nEnvironment Canada issues multiple warnings as B.C. braces for weekend heat\nVIDEO: Cherry season in the pits for the Okanagan\nTargeted shooting sends man to Kamloops hospital, car into river \n2 killed in West Vancouver head-on were international students: police\nConservatives have more money than rivals, spent far more on ads\nMore from Today In BC >\n \nThe Williams Lake Tribune\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nAdvertising\nSupport Centre\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nJoin our Team\nNews\nLocal News\nNewsletters\nSubscribe\nToday in BC\nCanadian News\nWorld News\nEntertainment\nSports\nBusiness\nTrending Now\nOpinion\nSubmit News Tips\nNeighbours\n100 Mile House Free Press\nAshcroft-Cache Creek Journal\nBarriere Star Journal\nCoast Mountain News\nClearwater North Thompson Times\nQuesnel Cariboo Observer\nMore\nOur Community\nPublic Notices\nVideo\nPhoto Galleries\nTravel\nWest Coast Traveller\nCannabis\nToday's Home\nPodcasts\nFood\nLife\nContact Us\nContests\nPuzzles\nContests\nShop\nImpress Stories\nSavvy Shopper\nImpress TV\nAdd Your Business\nE-Editions\nClassifieds\nAll Classifieds\nBook a Print Ad\nAuto\nToday's Drive\nAuto Showcase\nJobs\nLocalWork\nJoin Our Team\nObituaries\nCelebrations of Life\nFuneral Care Services\nIn Memory\nPlace an Obituary\nGood News\nLocal Good News\nSocial Media\nWilliams Lake Live\nToday in BC\nYoutube\nI love British Columbia\nI love Alberta\nI love Nunavut\nI love Yukon\nI love Northwest Territories\n\u00a9 2024 The Williams Lake Tribune and Black Press Media Publications Contact"},

Meet the sisterhood trying to bring them justice.\n\nBY MARIN COGAN\n\nILLUSTRATIONS BY DIEGO PATI\u00d1O\n\nJULY 6, 2016\n\nEvery July, more than a million people descend on Calgary, Canada, for Stampede, a 10-day rodeo and festival billed as \u201cThe Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth.\u201d A prairie city just east of the Rockies, Calgary is inundated with cowboys and denim-clad wannabes looking to eat fried food and watch bull riders. Stampede is also western Canada\u2019s answer to Mardi\u00a0Gras. Patrons pack shoulder-to-shoulder into neon-lit saloons and cavernous clubs, where female bartenders in crop tops and hot pants wander dance floors bearing trays of shots. Companies with names like \u201cBust Loose!\u201d deploy hundreds of buses, equipped with booming stereos and dance poles, to carry revelers on hours-long\u00a0pub crawls.\n\nFor Canada\u2019s aboriginal people, Stampede offers another kind of celebration: a chance to showcase their cultures. (Indigenous populations include the country\u2019s 634 First Nations as well as M\u00e9tis and Inuit citizens.) At Stampede Park, the event\u2019s main grounds in downtown Calgary, native craftspeople show spectators how to raise\u00a0tipis, carve knives out of stone, and use butchered animals\u2019 stomachs as cooking vessels.\n\nOn July 11, 2007, Sandra\u00a0Manyfeathers, a local educator, dancer, and member of the Blood Tribe, was slated to participate in the festivities. Then 36,\u00a0Manyfeathers\u00a0would join other indigenous performers at one of Stampede\u2019s Grandstand Shows, nightly entertainment extravaganzas featuring local talent. She hoped that her older sister, Jacqueline\u00a0Crazybull, would be watching.\n\nWith high, fine cheekbones and long, dark hair, the sisters \u2014 two of 12 siblings \u2014 looked alike. Crazybull\u00a0had helped raise Manyfeathers\u00a0after their mother died when they were young \u2014 20 and 12, respectively.\u00a0Crazybull\u00a0went on to have a dozen children of her own. Her life hadn\u2019t been easy; she\u2019d struggled with drug addiction and had sometimes been homeless. Still, she was lighthearted and quick to kindness, with a wide smile and a warm laugh.\u00a0She often showed up to cheer at Manyfeathers\u2019s\u00a0dance performances.\n\nBut\u00a0Crazybull\u00a0never made it. At about 4 a.m. that July 11, she and a cousin, Kirk\u00a0Steinhauer, were hungry for a snack and popped into a corner store on Calgary\u2019s Red Mile, a strip of restaurants and bars next to Stampede Park. Shortly after the two left the store, a group of young men in a sedan pulled up to the curb, rolled down a window, and asked for directions.\u00a0Crazybull\u00a0walked over to help.\u00a0Steinhauer\u00a0sat on a bus-stop bench and took his eyes off his cousin for only a moment. Then he heard her scream.\n\nThe sedan was peeling away down the street.\u00a0Crazybull\u00a0lay crumpled in pain on the pavement. Steinhauer dashed over and saw that she was alive but bleeding profusely from a stab wound to her stomach. Within minutes, Crazybull stopped\u00a0breathing. She was one of five people attacked that night in Calgary, seemingly at random, by the same men. She was the only aboriginal victim, and the only one who died.\n\nManyfeathers\u00a0heard the news that afternoon while in a trailer preparing for the Grandstand Show. She remembers feeling disbelief. It wasn\u2019t the first time heartbreak had touched her family. In 1991, another sister, Yvonne, had been beaten to death by a relative\u2019s boyfriend. Eight years later, a cousin, Gloria Blackplume, had been found in a Calgary alley, kicked to death by two male acquaintances.\n\nTheir stories are part of a larger tragedy. According to 2011 data, though Canada\u2019s 718,500 indigenous women make up just 4.3 percent of the country\u2019s female population, they represent around five times as many female homicide victims. Canadian police have found that 4.5 out of every 100,000 indigenous women die by homicide \u2014 for women overall, the figure is less than 1 \u2014 and that roughly 1,200 have been slain or have gone missing over the past three decades. Nongovernmental research, however, suggests the real number may top 4,000. How many cases have been solved is another point of dispute: The government claims nearly 90 percent, but some indigenous activists say it\u2019s closer to 50.\n\nOn the advice of tribal elders,\u00a0Manyfeathers\u00a0decided to go ahead with her Stampede performance in her sister\u2019s honor. Dressed in a colorful beaded gown with her hair in two thick braids, she took the stage. Accompanied by a drummer and led by instinct,\u00a0Manyfeathers\u00a0executed fast, intricate jumps and steps while twirling a shawl and spinning. She didn\u2019t register the audience. As if in a trance, she moved only for her sister that night.\n\nAfterward, she went to a nearby bathroom with another sibling, who at\u00a0Manyfeathers\u2019s\u00a0request used a pair of scissors to cut off her braids. In her culture, long hair is a sign of\u00a0well-being. Shearing it is an act of mourning but also creates room for spiritual growth.\n\nA few days later,\u00a0Manyfeathers\u00a0placed the braids, still laced with beads and feathers, on her sister\u2019s casket as it was lowered into the earth. Their First Nation traditions would prove some of\u00a0Manyfeathers\u2019s\u00a0only sources of solace as the hunt for her sister\u2019s killers unfolded \u2014 and then sputtered to a painful halt.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have\u00a0to feel sorry for me,\u201d\u00a0Manyfeathers\u00a0says. \u201cAs harsh as things are for First Nation people, we\u2019ve actually developed a skill to be able to get through things.\u201d It\u2019s the middle of April 2016, and she\u2019s sitting across from me over scrambled eggs at a diner not far from Stampede Park. At 45,\u00a0Manyfeathers\u00a0continues to dance, and she once again wears her hair long.\n\nA cultural educator by trade,\u00a0Manyfeathers\u00a0has the tough disposition of someone who\u2019s spent decades living a national crisis. Among the missing and slain aboriginal women, some have been felled by random crimes. Others have been sex workers strangled by johns, teenage runaways targeted by violent offenders, or victims of abusive boyfriends. Certain regions are more affected than others \u2014 a lonely stretch of mountain road in British Columbia is known as the \u201cHighway of Tears\u201d because dozens of women have died or disappeared there \u2014 but no location is immune.\n\nWhat\u00a0unites\u00a0the cases are the conditions that make native women vulnerable to violence, rooted in a colonial legacy of neglect and humiliation. Until just a few decades ago, the Canadian government tried to erase aboriginal cultures. Among other policies, the state denied natives\u00a0voting rights until 1960, unless they agreed to forgo indigenous status. Canada also forced 150,000 aboriginal children into \u201cresidential schools\u201d \u2014 state-funded boarding institutions where assimilation into white culture was mandatory. Students were beaten if they spoke in their native tongues, and an unknown number of girls\u00a0was\u00a0sterilized. The last of the 130 schools didn\u2019t close until 1996.\n\nToday, Canada\u2019s 1.4 million indigenous people suffer economically \u2014 36 percent of indigenous women live in poverty, for instance, versus 17 percent of their non-indigenous counterparts. One-third of indigenous people between the ages of 25 and 54\u00a0have\u00a0less than a high school education. Substance abuse is a rampant concern; in a 2011 national survey of First Nation adults living on reserves and in northern communities, 83 percent cited it as the biggest threat to aboriginal health. Dawn\u00a0Lavell-Harvard, president of the non-profit Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada (NWAC), says she once heard domestic abuse in aboriginal households called as normal as keeping \u201cketchup in the fridge.\u201d\n\n\u201cCanada has done a very good job of making indigenous people invisible,\u201d\u00a0Lavell-Harvard adds. \u201cRacism against indigenous people is justified, legitimized, accepted, and even ignored.\u201d According to 2016 data from the independent Canadian Institute for Identities and Migration, a quarter of the country holds a negative view of indigenous people. The only populations seen more unfavorably are Muslims (43 percent) and immigrants (28 percent).\n\nThis outlook bleeds into law enforcement, with police often misdirecting blame in cases involving missing or slain women. They claim aboriginal victims probably died of overdoses, committed suicide, or ran away from home. In some instances, they fail to follow up on leads. A recent Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC) survey of more than 110 native families who\u2019ve lost female relatives found that the average performance rating for police, on a scale of one to 10, was a mere 2.8. \u201cI feel like the police are not taking interest in anything that has anything to do with the aboriginal people,\u201d Maria\u00a0Pia\u00a0Benuen, whose best friend disappeared and has never been found, told the CBC.\n\nAs far back as 1991, activists organized a march demanding justice. It would take a full decade and a handful of high-profile killings for the Canadian government to pay even modest attention, in the form of reports and other bureaucratic mechanisms. Little was done, however, to crack existing cases or to prevent future ones. As recently as 2014, then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper rejected calls for a national investigation into the roots of the crisis. \u201cIt isn\u2019t really high on our radar, to be honest,\u201d he told a television interviewer.\n\nFaced with inertia, it has fallen to native women to become protesters, scholars, advocates, and even their own protectors. They have searched for the missing when police have stopped. They have organized rallies and memorials. They have published the best data on killings and disappearances. Whether they have collaborated or worked alone, their experiences are the threads of the same story, crosshatched across Canada\u2019s vast territory. They are the catalysts\u00a0who, this year, spurred a newly elected government to commence a pioneering federal inquiry.\n\nManyfeathers\u00a0is one of these women. She shares her story not so \u201cI can have a pity party,\u201d she says, as her coffee cools in a thick-rimmed mug on the Formica table between us. \u201cI do this so there is awareness.\u201d\n\nCrazybull\u2019s\u00a0killers\u00a0were reckless. There were people at the scene of the crime, including her cousin, and four stabbing victims who survived. (Steinhauer\u00a0did not respond to an interview request sent via his\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page.) Witnesses said the sedan was a light color and that three or four young black men were inside, but no one could identify them.\n\nFour months later, in November 2007, police released surveillance footage from Mac\u2019s Convenience Store, situated across the street from where Crazybull was killed. It showed three young black men shopping just before the stabbing spree. Police stopped short of calling the trio suspects but said they might have more information about the crimes. Still, no one came forward. Nine years later, no one ever has. Manyfeathers says she hasn\u2019t heard an update from law enforcement since 2008.\n\nInspector Don Coleman of Calgary\u2019s major crimes section tells me that authorities interviewed witnesses and believe they know the perpetrators\u2019 identities. Yet they don\u2019t have sufficient evidence to make arrests. \u201cThere are reasons why we can\u2019t move the file forward at this point,\u201d Coleman says, declining to elaborate. He admits that the police could be in closer touch with Crazybull\u2019s\u00a0relatives: \u201cWe probably don\u2019t do as good a job as families or we would like.\u201d\n\nFar bigger cases have stagnated despite far worse evidence. The December after Crazybull\u2019s death, Robert Pickton, a pig farmer in British Columbia, was convicted of murdering six women, five of whom were aboriginal. Police believed that he was probably responsible for as many as 49 homicides between the early 1980s and late 2001, and that about half of his victims were indigenous sex workers. Pickton\u2019s crimes, however, might have been solved much sooner. When prostitutes began disappearing from Vancouver in the 1990s, Lorimer Shenher, a detective, received an anonymous tip suggesting that police investigate Pickton. His superiors were dismissive. \u201cThere were so many biases against these women from police,\u201d Shenher\u00a0says, \u201can attitude of \u2018You get what you paid for.\u2019\u201d\n\nPickton\u00a0was charged with attempted murder in 1997. The woman, a sex worker, had been handcuffed and stabbed multiple times before fighting him off and running away.\u00a0Pickton\u00a0suffered knife wounds and was treated at the same hospital as the woman; in his pocket, doctors found the key to the cuffs still dangling from her arm. Yet\u00a0Pickton\u00a0claimed self-defense, and charges were dismissed on the grounds that the woman, who had a history of petty crime and drug addiction, was not sufficiently credible. Police collected\u00a0Pickton\u2019s\u00a0clothing but stashed it in a storage locker for more than seven years. When they were examined in 2004, after the killer\u2019s other crimes had been exposed, police found the DNA of two missing women.\n\nFailed opportunities mounted. In a book published last year,\u00a0Shenher\u00a0recounts how police twice interviewed a woman who told a friend that she\u2019d helped\u00a0Pickton\u00a0lure a sex worker and later saw him skinning her body on a meat hook in his barn.\u00a0Shenher\u00a0says officers were biased and unprepared in the questioning. As a result, they got no actionable information \u2014 and\u00a0Pickton\u00a0wasn\u2019t arrested for three more years. \u201cIf you were in any other job you\u2019d be fired for the kind of incompetence that I encountered in this investigation every day,\u201d\u00a0Shenher\u00a0tells me. \u201cNobody cared. Literally.\u201d\n\nWatching the news of\u00a0Pickton\u2019s\u00a0trial on television in Ottawa, Maryanne Pearce, then 35, was infuriated. \u201cIt was just so horrific,\u201d the part-Mohawk woman\u00a0recalls. \u201cIt was one of those \u2018I have to do something\u2019 moments.\u201d\n\nPearce enrolled in a doctoral program in law to research missing and murdered women but soon found that \u201cthere was nothing available to the public in terms of data\u201d because police had never published national statistics. So she began a project that would become her thesis. \u201cI decided I [would] just do a database,\u201d she says, \u201cnot having any idea of what I was getting myself into.\u201d\n\nBuilding an archive of media clippings about reported deaths and disappearances dating back as far as she could find, Pearce categorized women according to several factors, including whether they were mothers, worked in the sex trade, and had attended residential schools. The files grew so vast that the boxes holding them spilled from Pearce\u2019s small home office into her dining room.\n\nUnbeknownst to\u00a0Manyfeathers, her sister\u2019s story was included in those boxes. Back in Calgary, Manyfeathers was determined to keep Crazybull\u2019s memory alive. In October 2008, the month of her sister\u2019s birthday and just over a year after her slaying, Manyfeathers organized Justice for Jackie, a march that would become an annual ritual. She gathered\u00a0Crazybull\u2019s\u00a0children, family members, and friends at the city\u2019s Rouleauville\u00a0Square and walked 10 blocks to the corner where her sister had died. They carried a banner with\u00a0Crazybull\u2019s\u00a0picture. Some sang traditional songs. Others prayed out loud for the killers to be caught.\n\nAround that time,\u00a0a new case emerged just over 800 miles east in Manitoba, Canada\u2019s geographic heartland. Claudette Osborne, a 21-year-old mother of four, disappeared from Winnipeg on July 24, 2008. She had a history of sex work and substance abuse. Social services had taken her youngest child, born 15 days before Osborne went missing, and had told her to seek drug treatment. Her last contact with her family was a phone message she left with a sibling saying that she was at Winnipeg\u2019s Lincoln Motor Hotel with a man who made her feel unsafe.\n\nOsborne\u2019s sister, Bernadette Smith, became the lost woman\u2019s staunchest advocate. Smith says police were slow to respond. \u201cShe was reported missing, but it was 10 days before her case was even looked at,\u201d Smith testified before Canada\u2019s Parliament several years later. The Winnipeg Police Department\u2019s policy on missing persons is flexible: A \u201crisk assessment\u201d is conducted, examining factors such as age and lifestyle. Then, \u201cif the assessment dictates, a uniform car will be dispatched to begin the investigation.\u201d Osborne\u2019s background seemingly would have placed her at high risk. Yet Smith claims police took the case less seriously because of it. \u201c[They] told us that they weren\u2019t going to do anything right now, that she\u2019d turn up,\u201d Smith testified. When they did start looking, security-camera footage from the Lincoln Motor Hotel on the day Osborne vanished had already been taped over.\n\nSmith wasn\u2019t a stranger to shoddy police work. It had taken 15 years for authorities to make arrests in the 1971 slaying of her cousin, Helen Betty Osborne, despite informants providing the names of three of the four men involved. (One suspect was later convicted, another was acquitted, and one received immunity for testifying. The fourth was never charged.) In 2003, another 16-year-old relative\u2019s severed arm and leg turned up in Winnipeg\u2019s Red River; that killing was never solved. Frustrated by another case going nowhere fast, Smith organized a concert and candlelight vigil on the first anniversary of her sister\u2019s disappearance, honoring missing and slain women across Manitoba. Relatives of victims leaned on one another, Smith later testified, \u201cbecause there\u2019s not enough support out there.\u201d (She has since developed an online tool kit for victims\u2019 families, including a log to record interactions with police and a customizable missing-persons poster.)\n\nThe month of the memorial concert, a Winnipeg construction crew uncovered the body of\u00a0Cherisse\u00a0Houle, 17. Just seven weeks later, the corpse of her friend, Hillary Angel Wilson, 18, was found along a dirt path. No suspects were identified. The deaths angered many native women. A friend of Wilson\u2019s told the CBC, \u201cThere is a group of us women that are going to get together \u2026 and talk about what can we do \u2026 as a community, as mothers, as sisters, as aboriginal women here, because not enough is being done.\u201d Smith and other advocates demanded that Manitoba create a police task force to investigate unsolved cases. Less than a week after Wilson was found, in late August 2009, Manitoba acquiesced. After a review of dozens of cold cases, police chose to investigate 27 involving female victims.\n\nTo date, Project Devote, as it\u2019s known, has identified just one perpetrator. When Myrna\u00a0Letandre\u00a0went missing in 2006, her family told police that she\u2019d mentioned knowing someone named\u00a0Traigo. Yet authorities didn\u2019t search the rooming house where\u00a0Letandre, unemployed and receiving government disability checks, and a man named\u00a0Traigo\u00a0Andretti had been living. Seven years later, police working for Project Devote found\u00a0Letandre\u2019s\u00a0remains in the house\u2019s basement. The same week, Andretti was charged with killing his wife in British Columbia. After being handed a life sentence for that crime, he was convicted of\u00a0Letandre\u2019s\u00a0murder. In court,\u00a0Letandre\u2019s\u00a0family issued a statement blaming police \u201cfor the loss of another life. We did our best to have this man talked to, investigated, but despite our numerous pleas, nothing \u2014 absolutely nothing \u2014 was done.\u201d\n\nFemale advocates spurred other limited actions by provincial governments. In March 2010, the NWAC announced that it had identified 582 cases of missing and slain women nationwide dating back to 1944. Several trends stood out: The chances of an aboriginal woman being killed either by a partner or by someone she knew were the same, for instance, while she was almost three times more likely than a non-indigenous woman to be killed by a stranger. The largest concentration of cases, 28 percent, was in British Columbia, a figure that demanded a public reckoning on the heels of Robert\u00a0Pickton\u2019s\u00a0shocking trial.\n\nThat fall, British Columbia launched a commission of inquiry led by a former attorney general, yet the investigation was dogged by controversy. Its mandate only encompassed cases and police work from 1997 to 2002 \u2014 Pickton\u2019s\u00a0most active years. This left many women\u2019s stories, namely those who weren\u2019t the serial killer\u2019s victims, beyond the scope. The government also declined to pay for legal representation before the commission, which many aboriginal stakeholders couldn\u2019t afford.\n\nOne lawyer, Robyn\u00a0Gervais, was appointed to represent indigenous interests, but she resigned after six months because she thought the inquiry focused too heavily on police testimony. \u201c[G]iven\u00a0that these hearings are largely about missing and murdered aboriginal women,\u201d\u00a0Gervais, a M\u00e9tis woman, told the commission, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I should fight to have their voices heard.\u201d A month later, a former commission staffer, anonymously describing sexism behind the commission\u2019s scenes, told the\u00a0National Post\u00a0that a senior colleague once referred to a sex worker as \u201cthe fat hooker.\u201d\n\nIn late 2012, the embattled commission released a report with more than 60 policy recommendations, including sensitivity training for police and frequent reviews of cold cases. Many of the items, however, were never implemented. Nearly two years on, an op-ed in the\u00a0Globe and Mail\u00a0argued that the report, titled \u201cForsaken,\u201d might as well have been called \u201cIgnored and\u00a0Forgotten.\u201d In the intervening months, Human Rights Watch (HRW) described how police in British Columbia had \u201cblamed,\u201d \u201cshamed,\u201d and even sexually assaulted some aboriginal women seeking their protection. Law enforcement responded by saying there was little it could do unless\u00a0HRW\u2019s\u00a0anonymous sources came forward with accusations.\n\nMeanwhile, indigenous activists found their work under siege nationwide. Harper\u2019s conservative government eliminated funding previously allocated to the NWAC to research violence against aboriginal women, insisting that more \u201caction\u201d was needed. Yet authorities\u2019 next step was downsizing. Over three years, starting in 2012, aboriginal groups suffered a 59 percent cut in government support, as part of the prime minister\u2019s push to balance the national budget. Moreover, Canada\u2019s department of aboriginal affairs withheld $1 billion in promised spending on social services over five years.\n\nAn agency representative told the CBC that this was \u201csimply due to timing issues.\u201d Activists saw the situation differently. The cuts were evidence of \u201ca larger government attitude that indigenous women just didn\u2019t matter,\u201d says the\u00a0NWAC\u2019s\u00a0Lavell-Harvard, \u201cand indigenous lives didn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nMaryanne Pearce wanted\u00a0to depict the sheer scale of the crisis in a way that couldn\u2019t be ignored. In late 2013, she published her 1,126-page thesis, \u201cAn Awkward Silence.\u201d Pearce had found 824 cases of missing and slain indigenous women spanning three decades; her files filled nine crates in her home. She released her data online in a PDF, including a searchable, 54-page index listing victims\u2019 names and demographics.\n\nThe thesis made news because its count was so much higher than any previously reported \u2014 and because an academic, not the government, had produced it. \u201cFamilies seeking loved ones hope new database will spark fresh action,\u201d the CBC reported. The day after her thesis became public, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) called Pearce and asked for access to her research materials.\n\nIn May 2014, the RCMP released its own findings with the most jarring statistics to date: 1,181 aboriginal women had vanished or had been slain between 1980 and 2012. The government report hit Canada like a cold shock. The media splashed the story across front pages and aired angry critics\u2019 voices. Cameron Alexis, a regional chief with the Assembly of First Nations, lamented \u201ca national shame and\u00a0a national tragedy.\u201d Carolyn Bennett, a liberal member of Parliament, declared, \u201cThis is not an aboriginal issue, it is not a women\u2019s issue, it is an ongoing Canadian tragedy.\u201d The office of the U.N. special\u00a0rapporteur\u00a0on the rights of indigenous peoples, HRW, and other international organizations joined the outcry. To\u00a0Lavell-Harvard, the noise was critical. \u201cThe more we got the average Canadian understanding,\u201d she says, \u201cthe more outraged they were to think this was happening in their backyards.\u201d\n\nThe Harper government said it supported improved policing and\u00a0and\u00a0more funding for protective measures such as women\u2019s shelters. Yet it dismissed calls for a national inquiry into the origins of the crisis. When two more young women were brutalized in Winnipeg later that summer, that refusal seemed all the more galling.\n\nTina Fontaine\u00a0was\u00a0a 15-year-old girl living in foster care. On Aug. 9, 2014, she ran away from the Winnipeg hotel where child services was housing her; until a recent policy change, it was a common practice in Manitoba\u2019s overcrowded foster system for authorities to put charges in hotel rooms. Eight days later, Fontaine\u2019s body was found wrapped in a duvet cover in the Red River. The man charged in her slaying, Raymond Cormier, had more than 90 criminal convictions. Police said he was an early suspect, but that they had \u201cnumerous\u201d others to eliminate first. He was finally arrested in December 2015. (Cormier\u2019s case was still in court at press time.)\n\nThree months after Fontaine\u2019s body was recovered,\u00a0Rinelle\u00a0Harper, 16, was found on the banks of the Assiniboine River. She had been sexually assaulted and thrown into the frigid water \u2014 only to crawl out and be attacked again. Unlike Fontaine, she survived. Not only were her assailants arrested within a matter of days,\u00a0but\u00a0Harper was the rare victim to speak publicly about her experience. (She is not related to Stephen Harper.) In December 2014, the shy teenager appeared before a meeting of First Nation elders and called on the Canadian government to take action. In a trembling voice barely above a whisper, Harper said, \u201cI respectfully challenge you all to call for a national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women.\u201d\n\nNews of her plea spread across social media \u2014 as did the prime minister\u2019s public statement that a killing was a crime, not a \u201csociological phenomenon.\u201d Holly Jarrett, the cousin of a woman slain in Halifax, posted a photo of herself online with the\u00a0hashtag\u00a0#AmINext. Within hours, aboriginal women nationwide were tweeting photos with the same caption. Veteran activist Bernadette Smith helped organize a volunteer group called Drag the Red, which used nets, chains, and hooks to search the Red River for more human remains. \u201cWe know it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d Smith told the\u00a0Globe and Mail, \u201cbut we have to at least try.\u201d Drag the Red has since handed over snagged evidence, including bones and a bloody carpet, to police.\n\nIn March 2015, a U.N. committee declared that Canada had committed grave violations of indigenous women\u2019s rights by not offering them sufficient protection from violence. It, too, recommended a national inquiry.\u00a0Manyfeathers\u00a0agreed with the appeal \u2014 with one stipulation: Aboriginal women would need to be in charge. \u201cWe\u2019re not sitting idle,\u201d she told the CBC.\n\nTiming, for once, was on the activists\u2019 side. Public awareness peaked in an election year. Justin Trudeau, Harper\u2019s liberal rival, whose affinity for native cultures was evident in a shoulder tattoo designed by the\u00a0Haida\u00a0people, blasted the prime minister\u2019s opposition to an inquiry.\u00a0 \u201cIf people think they already know what the problem is, then why haven\u2019t they fixed it?\u201d Trudeau asked\u00a0during a\u00a0town hall meeting in October 2015.\u00a0Lavell-Harvard remarks that missing and murdered women becoming a steady part of campaign dialogue marked the first time \u201cthat people outside of the indigenous community saw indigenous issues as their issues.\u201d\n\nCanadians overwhelmingly elected Trudeau last October. One of his first acts was to announce a national inquiry. \u201cThe victims deserve justice,\u201d he told a gathering of First Nation chiefs in Gatineau, Qu\u00e9bec,\u00a0a\u00a0year after\u00a0Rinelle\u00a0Harper\u2019s speech. \u201cTheir families [deserve] an opportunity to heal and to be heard.\u201d\n\nWhen I meet with Carolyn Bennett, now Canada\u2019s minister of indigenous and northern affairs, on a rainy April morning at a hotel on New York\u2019s Upper West Side, she looks more like an activist than a bureaucrat. She\u2019s wearing a red T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase \u201cNo More Stolen Sisters,\u201d which matches her red-framed glasses and the red heart pin on her sleeve. She is slated to speak that day about Canada\u2019s missing and slain women at the Women in the World conference.\n\nBennett, whom Trudeau tapped to craft an inquiry, is in a reflective mood. She recently wrapped up a two-month road trip in which she and her colleagues \u2014 Patty\u00a0Hajdu, minister on the status of women, and Jody Wilson-Raybould, minister of justice \u2014 traveled from British Columbia to Nova Scotia to meet with indigenous communities and survivors of violence to hear what they want from an inquiry.\n\n\u201cThere were people who ran away from the\u00a0Pickton\u00a0farm,\u201d Bennett recalls. \u201cThere were people who were captured and held in a cabin and ran away and ended up in an ER department with bruises around their neck who were now prepared to tell their stories.\u201d Among participants\u2019 requests for the inquiry were that cold cases be prioritized and \u2014 echoing\u00a0Manyfeathers \u2014 that indigenous women take the lead.\n\nThe listening tour made waves when\u00a0Hajdu\u00a0told the press\u00a0that,\u00a0based on what she\u2019d heard from the NWAC and other groups, the number of missing and slain women might top 4,000. \u201cWhen you actually start to add in disputed cases,\u201d\u00a0Hajdu\u00a0said, \u201cfor example, people that it\u2019s been claimed [committed] suicide or a death due to exposure [when] in fact there are symptoms or signs that maybe it wasn\u2019t, then of course the numbers can jump.\u201d\n\nBennett\u2019s office will release a plan for the inquiry this summer, including details on the timeline and who will take the helm. Yet the ultimate goal lies further down the road. \u201cGirls are still going missing and being murdered in numbers that are inexcusable,\u201d Bennett tells me. \u201cWhat do we need to do to actually put an end to this tragedy?\u201d\n\nStemming the crisis could require a combination of police reform, job creation, educational opportunities, domestic violence prevention, substance abuse treatment, improved public transportation, and anti-racism campaigns. Recommending change is easy enough. As British Columbia\u2019s commission proved, however, implementing it is not.\n\nA March poll showed that 79 percent of Canadians\u00a0support the inquiry \u2014 estimated to cost $40 million \u2014 but 48 percent are\u00a0pessimistic that it will bring about real change. Female activists are cautiously optimistic, yet they fear the government could rehash work they\u2019ve already done. \u201cWhat I would hope is that it won\u2019t just tell us that there\u2019s a problem,\u201d says Melina\u00a0Laboucan-Massimo, whose sister\u00a0plummeted from a 36-story condominium in Toronto in 2013. The death was ruled suspicious after police, according to the victim\u2019s family, failed to secure the scene. \u201cWe know that there\u2019s a problem,\u201d\u00a0Laboucan-Massimo continues. \u201cWe don\u2019t need them to spend millions on that.\u201d\n\nAs the inquiry moves forward, many women are continuing the painstaking grassroots work that pushed the government to act.\u00a0Manyfeathers\u00a0is planning the ninth Justice for Jackie march and has collaborated with a niece, Lauren\u00a0Crazybull, on an audio documentary about violence against indigenous women. It was aired at special events in Calgary, Edmonton, and\u00a0Lethbridge.\n\nAfter breakfast at the diner,\u00a0Manyfeathers\u00a0takes me to her vehicle, a black Equinox. She wants to show me a beaded breastplate she crafted in tribute to her older sister. She wears it when she dances. Standing in the parking lot,\u00a0Manyfeathers\u00a0unfolds the intricately stitched garment and lays it gently on her SUV\u2019s hood. She points to 12 feathers representing\u00a0Crazybull\u2019s\u00a0children. There\u2019s also a butterfly encircled by a medicine wheel set against a black backdrop with pink trim. \u201cThe black represents the way\u00a0that my\u00a0sister was murdered,\u201d\u00a0Manyfeathers\u00a0explains. The butterfly symbolizes the stages of grief.\n\nThere are three spots left\u00a0unbeaded, signaling an unfinished storyline. \u201cNobody has ever been charged in Jackie\u2019s murder,\u201d\u00a0Manyfeathers\u00a0says. \u201c[The perpetrators] continue to live in free society. Canada continues to allow them to do that. I don\u2019t know if they have children now, if they celebrate birthday parties, and Thanksgiving, and Christmas\u2026. But they took my sister\u2019s life, and she doesn\u2019t get to have them.\u201d\n\nIt took\u00a0Manyfeathers\u00a0nine months to make the breastplate. She\u2019s been wearing it for eight years. Lately, though, she\u2019s been thinking about retiring it. It\u2019s not that she\u2019s giving up on finding her sister\u2019s killers or on honoring\u00a0Crazybull\u2019s\u00a0memory. She just feels ready for a change. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d she says.\n\nA version of this article originally appeared in the July/August issue of \u00a0FP\u00a0magazine under the title \u201cThe Sisterhood.\u201d\n\nMarin Cogan is a journalist living in Washington, D.C.

(Colleen Flanagan/The News)\nExpand\n\nThe rain was more like a mist \u2013 at first \u2013 before the larger droplets started falling from the sky.\n\nIt was almost as if tears literally started falling from the heavens for each lap walked and each woman\u2019s story read during Maple Ridge Secondary\u2019s Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women\u2019s walk on Friday, May 5 \u2013 commonly known as Red Dress Day in Canada and the United States.\n\nGrade 10 Maple Ridge Secondary student Nye Holmes, a member of the Circle of Indigenous Youth and Allies, an Indigenous leadership group at MRSS who was hosting the event, explained the event was not only being held to honour missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada, but particularly those who have gone missing along what is called the Highway of Tears \u2013 a 725 kilometre stretch of Highway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert, along which nine young women went missing or were discovered murdered between 1989 to 2006. All but one of the women were Indigenous, according to the Carrier Sekani Family Services\u2019 Highway of Tears governing body, a group dedicated to stopping the violence along the highway.\n\nThe leadership group was hoping that the community would come together to walk the same distance as the Highway of Tears around the track at MRSS. And only an hour into the walk that was set to take place from 9-5 p.m. the group was already half way to their goal with many participants walking, even running, multiple laps of the 400 metre track.\n\nREAD MORE: Maple Ridge students asking community to march for murdered and missing Indigenous women\n\nALSO: \u2018We are in a crisis\u2019: Red Dress Day honoured as leaders say more work to be done\n\nNye explained that many women have gone missing along Highway 16 because there are no cell towers or bus routes.\n\n\u201cA lot of women go missing along this highway because there\u2019s just no way to get from one community to another without walking or hitchhiking,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re trying to get people of our community to walk the same walk that these women did when they went missing,\u201d she said.\n\nEvery 14 kilometres walked was marked with a moccasin sticker on a map of the Highway of Tears, made by MRSS art teacher David Xavier.\n\nThe group invited other schools and community groups to participate, within Maple Ridge and surrounding communities.\n\nKelli Paddon, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity in BC, said that for everyone who holds a red dress as a symbol of sorrow, outrage and action against the murder and harm of Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit and non-binary people on Red Dress Day, that she stands with them as a voice in the government.\n\n\u201cHarm against women, girls, Two-Spirit and non-binary people is preventable. Ending this violence means confronting biases and stereotypes. It means speaking up when someone is being treated badly.

The safe house, which also provided counselling and other services, probably saved that woman\u2019s life, she said.\n\nAddictions services, counselling\n\n\u201cOur goal is the safety of the victims and their families,\u201d said LBN Chief Wilf Adam.\n\nAdam noted that treatment will be available for people with addictions, along with preventative services to keep people from falling into cycles of drug or alcohol abuse.\n\nCSFS said the facility will feature programming specific to the Carrier people. \u201cServices will empower women to live healthy lives and build healthy relationships and circles of support,\u201d according to the CSFS.\n\nSafe houses stigmatized\n\nAdam told the Lakes District News that stigma around people who may occupy safe houses resulted in some resistance to hosting the shelter locally.\n\nBut he said those concerns aren\u2019t warranted, and that similar facilities are \u201cthe safest places around\u201d and often impossible to distinguish from the surrounding homes. He added that the facility will have 24-hour security.\n\nCSFS said in a statement that the facility will have an unlisted address and phone number and will be ringed by fencing with secured access, along with security cameras.\n\nIndigenous-owned and operated\n\nCSFS obtained $1.89 million in federal money from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) for the safe house. LBN will hold the mortgage, which will be gradually paid for by CSFS, said Adam.\n\nUltimately, LBN will hold the assets, making it a First Nations owned and operated facility.

It started in 2010, with the bright dresses often seen hanging in doorways and windows as a visual reminder.\n\nBetween 2001 to 2015, Statistics Canada reports the homicide rate for Indigenous women was nearly six times higher than that of non-Indigenous women.\n\nCaitlin Potts went missing from the Enderby area in February, 2016.\n\nShe has not been heard from since making contact with friends on social media Feb. 26 that year.\n\nThe 27-year-old First Nations woman was reported missing March 1, 2016.\n\nAshley Simpson, 31, disappeared on April 28, 2016. She lived in the Yankee Flats area near Silver Creek.\n\nLife \"changed that day that someone took her, five years of pain and anguish, five years of hope and praying five years of searching for the answers but still nothing,\" her father, John Simpson, posted on Facebook.\n\nOn July 22, 2016, 46-year-old Deanna Mildred Wertz was reported missing from the Enderby area.\n\nShortly after her disappearance, police searched eight square kilometres by land and air, focusing on the Yankee Flats area.\n\nWertz was an experienced hiker, and investigators appealed to anyone who may have been travelling off-road near Yankee Flats on the morning of July 19.\n\nNicole Bell, 31, was reported missing Sept. 7, 2017 from the Sicamous area.\n\nHer mother, Jane Aubertin, travelled from Calgary to join a rally at the Vernon courthouse last month for the missing women.\n\nThe only publicized break in the missing women cases came in October 2017, when the remains of Vernon teen Traci Genereaux were found on a Salmon River Road farm following an extensive police investigation.\n\nGenereaux was last heard from on May 29 that year.\n\nPolice called her death suspicious, but no charges have been filed in the case.\n\nPhoto: Contributed\n\nBack to Homepage\n\nTypos\nNews Tips\nForums\n\nMUST-READ STORIES\n\nGet all the day's most vital news with our newsletter, sent every weekday.\n\n\n\nMore Vernon News\n\n\n\nRECENT STORIES\nHuge majority for Labour?\nUnited Kingdom - 2:46 pm\nMan dies in Lynn Canyon\nNorth Vancouver - 2:29 pm\nWrong way driver arrested\nKelowna - 2:25 pm\nAmbushed in failed hit job\nKamloops - 1:46 pm\nHeat warnings issued\nBC Coast - 1:43 pm\nMore Top Stories >\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal Estate\n667 Burne Ave\n3 bedrooms 2 baths\n$895,000\nmore details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalmon Arm SPCA Featured Pet\n\n\nPiper\nSalmon Arm SPCA >\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBody transformation journeys\nGalleries | July 04, 2024\nVanessa Hudgens gives birth\nShowbiz | July 04, 2024\nBaseball playing pup\nMust Watch | July 04, 2024\nMischievous Beagle caught tearing up the toilet paper\nMust Watch | July 04, 2024\nVintage bathrooms\nGalleries | July 04, 2024\n\n\n\nNorth Okanagan Quick Links\nCity of Vernon\nVernon Discussion Forum\nDistrict of Coldstream\nVillage of Lumby\nCity of Armstrong\nCity of Enderby\nDistrict of Sicamous\nInterior Health\nOkanagan Regional Library\n\u00a9 2024 Castanet.net Make Castanet Your Homepage News Tips Advertising Contact Us"},

He was last seen in Kamloops, B.C.\n\nShe said gathering with the community helps with healing.\n\n\"It helps me to know that the public, the community, are with us remembering our loved ones that are still missing and not found today.\"\n\nOver at Mount Royal University, red dresses were an important symbol for lives lost.\n\nThe final report into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and two-spirit people released in 2019, found that they are 12 times more likely to be murdered or go missing than any other group.\n\nBack at Siksika, leaders say they want the federal government to follow through on the 231 calls for justice \u2013 and to provide more mental health support.\n\n\"We're not done yet,\" said Sleigh.\" We're not done.

The travelling exhibit is in the third year of bringing the powerful reality to communities across the Pembina Valley and to honour the lives of each Manitoban who has never made it home. \u00a0\n\nPembina Valley Red Dress Project (PVRDP) Member Christina Cearns said as an Indigenous woman, who was taken from her reserve and adopted into a non-Indigenous home, it was important for her to join this group.\n\n\"I have joined the Pembina Valley Red Dress Project because it is something dear to my heart, me being an Indigenous woman myself, and understanding the impact it has on the Indigenous community. Along with the children that we have as a montage.\"\u00a0\n\nPVRDP Denise Thiessen and Christina Cearns\n\nAn \"Every Child Matters\" portion of the exhibit had a tree of Orange Shirts with children's shoes leading up to the \"Every Child Matters\" banner in remembrance of the many children who never made it home from Residential Schools and the abuse of those who survived.\n\nEvery Child Matters Display\n\nEcole Morden Middle School students made dresses that hung in a tree with positive words said to indigenous women on one side and negative words on the other.\u00a0\n\nEMMS MMIWG2S Art Project\u00a0\n\nCearns explained why it is important to bring awareness to MMIGW2S.\n\n\"It's a time to grieve. It is a grieving, but it's also an honouring system as well, all in one. With suffering comes compassion. And with that, we can grow as a community on that, by sharing that, and in our history as well.\"\u00a0\n\nOne tree has several red dresses with names embroidered in them, representing families living in the Pembina Valley with a missing or murdered loved one.\u00a0\n\nCearns said she was able to share her own story with people too. \u00a0\n\n\"The impact it has had and then sharing your story with them on the whole aspect of just being adopted out off the reserve to some of the people and then listening to their stories come back. And then, having that time of healing. To cry together, to share that story, listen to what is going on, and then share the perspective of why this is important and why it's becoming a huge thing in our country.\" \u00a0\n\nCearns talks with exhibit guest\n\nExecutive Director for Genesis House Ang Braun explained why the organization took part in the exhibit.\u00a0\n\n\"Indigenous women and girls are at a significantly higher risk than the rest of the population in Canada to experience gender-based violence. And so, the more light we can shed on that whole topic; historically, what has happened and where we are today and what we need to see going forward, it's important that we're present at these events so that people know where they can go for help, but also, we can't hang red dresses every day. And so, when we're not hanging red dresses, what are we each doing in our daily lives that supports ending this tragedy?\" \u00a0\n\nCearns said learning about Indigenous culture was part of the conversations with people who took time to come through the parks. She was able to explain bead making and smudging to the many eager to learn.\u00a0\n\n\"Most of them, when they come and they talk, if they have Indigenous background, it's been the same thing on what their stories were and just not having a voice, and them seeing this and the sad reminder over here. (Pointing to the Red Dresses on display) It is sad, but in a beautiful way, we're calling them back home.\"\u00a0\n\nThe PV Red Dress Project will be in Killarney Park June 3rd and in Morden for Indigenous Day June 24th.

At least 60 people assembled at Annie Pootoogook Park in Ottawa\u2019s Sandy Hill neighbourhood for an afternoon vigil to mark what is more commonly referred to as Red Dress Day. The event was organized by Tungasuvvingat Inuit, and it featured political speakers, drumming and throat singing. Mikka Komaksiutiksak, an organizer of TI\u2019s Arsaniq safe space program for 2SLGBTQIA+ Inuit in Ottawa, echoed what MPs said this week, calling violence against Indigenous women and girls an epidemic that needs to be stopped. \u201cWe come here to honour those people in our\u2026\n\nThis content is for Yearly Subscription, Yearly Subscription \u2013 Corporate, and Print Subscription Only members only.\nLog In Register\nFacebook\nTwitter\nShare\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

Transit has launched an online survey to gauge public support for its proposed scheduling and stops along Highway 16 West.\n\nThe survey is available through bctransit.com/highway16 until Sept. 16.\n\nOpportunities for first-hand looks at the proposed plans will also be available this Saturday at the B.C. Northern Exhibition in Prince George, 4-8 p.m. and at the Nechako Valley Exhibition in Vanderhoof, 9 a.m.-1 p.m.\n\n\"The engagement process will assist us in designing a system that will meet the needs of our customers and the communities along Highway 16,\" said B.C. Transit president and CEO Manuel Achadinha in a statement. \"It is important that we hear from as many people as possible through the engagement process.\"\n\nB.C. Transit is proposing to offer four services along the route - between Prince George and Burns Lake, Burns Lake and Smithers, between Kispiox and Terrace and between Terrace and between Terrace and Prince Rupert - with stops at various communities in between.\n\nThe proposed fare is $5 cash per trip or 10 trips for $45.\n\nRespondents are asked whether they support those routes, which two days they would like to see them run, whether the proposed schedules work for them and whether they support the proposed fares.\n\nThe federal and provincial governments have committed $5 million over three years to an \"action plan\" to improve transportation along the 725-kilometre stretch.\n\nIn addition to bus service along the main route, it includes funding for webcams and bus shelters, a grant program to help outlying First Nations communities to buy shuttle vehicles and to provide driver education to boost the number of Class 4 and 5 drivers in those communities.\n\nB.C. Transit will cover two-thirds of the cost of the bus service and participating communities the remaining one-third. The more typical arrangement sees B.C. Transit cover 55 per cent.\n\nAlso known as the Highway of Tears, 18 women have been murdered or have disappeared along Highway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert and adjacent routes since the 1970s.\n\nB.C. Transit aims to have the first inter-city buses in service by the end of this year with the rest on the road in 2017.\n\nLeave a comment\nHave a story idea?\nReport a mistake\nThis has not been shared.

News\nCanada, Manitoba to develop Red Dress Alert for missing Indigenous women and girls\nThe Canadian Press\nMay 3, 2024 4:45 PM\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nListen to this article\n00:04:50\n\nCanada and Manitoba are partnering to launch an alert system that would inform the public when an Indigenous woman or girl goes missing, they announced Friday in Winnipeg, ahead of a national day to mark the crisis.\n\nThe long-awaited Red Dress Alert system is a bid to prevent deaths and increase safe reunions with loved ones.\n\nStatistics Canada concluded in a report last year that the homicide rate for Indigenous women and girls was six times higher than the rate for their non-Indigenous counterparts.\n\nA national inquiry concluded five years ago that they are 12 times more likely to go missing or murdered.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic moment, and a major step toward ending the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse peoples,\u201d said NDP MP Leah Gazan, who has lead federal advocacy on the alert.\n\n\u201cAnd while we celebrate this historic moment, it is critical to remember that we are not done until a Red Dress Alert is no longer needed.\u201d\n\nThe Manitoba pilot is to be designed with and led by Indigenous Peoples, and is expected to help inform an eventual national alert system.\n\nIt will be funded through moneys set aside in this year\u2019s federal and provincial budgets.\n\nNahanni Fontaine, Manitoba\u2019s minister for women and gender equity, said she has heard from community members who believe the alert system could help reduce risk for Indigenous women and girls.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working inclusively with Indigenous partners in Manitoba to find the best path forward as we build this pilot project.\u201d\n\nCrown-Indigenous Relations Minister Gary Anandasangaree said Winnipeg \u2014 and Manitoba writ large \u2014 is the epicentre of the crisis, and launching the Red Dress Alert there will bring forward solutions that can be implemented across the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the only solution, but it\u2019s a critical starting point for us to address the immediate crisis that exists.\u201d\n\nGazan\u2019s efforts on the file led a House of Commons committee to study the prospect for a national alert system.\n\nHer fellow MPs unanimously backed her motion in the House of Commons last year declaring the deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls a Canada-wide emergency.\n\nThe motion also called on the federal government to fund a new alert system that would operate much like Amber Alerts.\n\nOther North American jurisdictions already have similar alert systems, including Washington state\u2019s Missing Indigenous Person system.\n\nThe national inquiry\u2019s 2019 final report found deliberate rights violations were at the heart of violence against Indigenous women, girls and gender-diverse people.\n\nWith the final report came 231 calls to justice directed toward governments, social service providers, industry and Canadians, but relatively little progress has been made to date.\n\nSheila North, former grand chief of Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak and an ex-journalist, has been a vocal advocate in ending violence against Indigenous women.\n\nShe said that while news of an alert system is welcome, she hopes expectations are kept reasonable \u2014 at least for now.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be bumps in the road \u2014 there\u2019s going to be challenges that maybe none of us see right now,\u201d she said. \u201cInevitably, someone is going to be disappointed.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s the starting point that matters, she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s high time.\u201d\n\nTo those who may not see the value in an alert system for Indigenous women, North said people of that identity have been shut out of many parts of society \u201cfor so long,\u201d and the deaths \u201care a result of it.\u201d\n\nThe House of Commons committee studying the alert has heard testimony from experts who stress any system should be Indigenous-led.\n\nThat\u2019s in part to mitigate the problems of police inaction and bureaucratic red tape, so that members of the public are notified of a disappearance promptly and efficiently.\n\nJennifer Jesty, who serves as the resiliency manager for the Union of Nova Scotia Mi\u2019kmaq, spoke to MPs about her own efforts to get an emergency alert system running for her communities and attempts to minimize police interference.\n\nSince September 2020, Jesty told the committee in late March that she sent out 183 alerts and reunited 67 people with their families as a result \u2014 the vast majority of whom were brought back together with their families within an hour of the alert going out.\n\n\u201cBecause this system was designed by us, for us, we were able to create our own protocols around when, how and why an alert should or shouldn\u2019t be sent,\u201d Jesty said.\n\n\u201cThere has not been one single request for an alert that has been denied, and every single alert has been sent out within minutes of receiving the information.\u201d\n\nHave a

Every year on the fifth day of May, red dresses are hung on display to honour the victims, survivors, and those impacted by the ongoing crisis of gender-based and racialized violence faced by Canada\u2019s Indigenous population.\n\nRed Dress Day was inspired by Winnipeg artist Jaime Black\u2019s The REDress Project, an art installation in which red dresses were hung in public spaces around North America as a visual reminder of the absent women who will never have the chance to wear them.\n\nIn 2014, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) released a report stating that a total of 1,181 Indigenous women and girls were killed or went missing in Canada between 1980 and 2012, based on incidents reported to all police jurisdictions across Canada.\n\nHowever, research conducted by the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada estimated that number is actually closer to 4,000.\n\nJust before Red Dress Day on May 4, the House of Commons passed a motion tabled by NDP critic for women and gender equity, Leah Gazan, declaring the crisis of MMIWG2S a national emergency.\n\nTAGS\nRed dress day\nPrevious article\nPrince Albert business community \u2018punching above its weight class\u2019 says upcoming chamber speaker\nNext article\nWatsonairs seek to lift spirits with annual spring concert\nDaily Herald\nhttps://paherald.sk.ca\nTop Stories\nSask Rivers Community Engagement report highlights SCCs and SRSC\nJuly 1, 2024\nMan airlifted to Saskatoon after accident Friday\nJune 30, 2024\nPredators fall short in Founders Cup play-in\nJuly 1, 2024\nQueen City Road Trip: Predators hoping to punch ticket...\nJune 27, 2024\nPrince Albert Police Association awards Kerrianne Dawn Bergen Memorial...\nJune 28, 2024\nPrince Albert set for Canada Day celebrations\nJune 28, 2024\nPOPULAR CATEGORY\nNews\n10826\nTop Stories\n7159\nSports\n3716\nOpinion\n1495\nRural Roots\n1078\nArts\n1063\nCommunity Voices\n835\nThe Northern Advocate\n401\nPrince Albert Daily Herald\nEmployee-owned and operated, community focused\nFOLLOW US\n\nPrince Albert's Only Locally-Owned Daily Newspaper.\n\nContact us: contactus@paherald.sk.ca\n\n\u00a9 FolioJumpline Publishing Inc.\n\nAbout Us\nAdvertise\nContact Us\nFlyers\nDigital Subscription\nMy account"},

It\u2019s telling serial killers that it\u2019s OK to dispose of women\u2019s bodies in the landfill, and that nobody will search for them. (It) is telling Indigenous women that they are trash.\u201d\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMerrick said, \u201call our women need to be found regardless of where they\u2019re from or regardless of who they are. We just need to find them, and we just need closure for families.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re human beings, and that\u2019s literally all we want to be treated as,\u201d Harris said.\n\nOn Thursday, Harris spoke at a Red Dress Day event at the University of Manitoba, hoping to raise awareness of the MMIWG crisis.\n\n2:02\nRed Dress Day honours memory of MMIWG2S\n\n\u201cThis is something that strikes the heart of our Indigenous people and people across Turtle Island in Canada. This is an ongoing crisis,\u201d she said.\n\nAdele Perry, the director of the University of Manitoba\u2019s Centre of Human Rights, said a combination of systemic issues often contributes to public apathy.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cColonialism, both of the past and of the present, racism, patriarchy, (and) sexism have come together to produce a context where Indigenous women, girls and two-spirited people, have found themselves disproportionately coming to harm,\u201d Perry said.\n\n\u201cWe, as a society, have repeatedly shown ourselves kind of unable and unwilling, and often kind of a combination of both, to address those circumstances and to honour to those women and girls and two-spirited people, and their families,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cWithout our women and without our children, we would simply and disturbingly be non-existent as a society,\u201d Harris said.\n\nA search of the landfill was promised by current Premier Wab Kinew as a part of his election campaign.\n\n2:14\nJustice for families at \u2018top of mind\u2019 for landfill search, Manitoba premier says\n\nIn February, he announced he was confident the search would take place within the year. The province said there has been no updates regarding timelines, but noted it would keep watch over what happens in Saskatoon.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne month later, the provincial and federal governments have committed a collective $40 million to find the remains of the slain women.\n\nMeanwhile, alleged serial killer Jeremy Skibicki awaits a court ruling for the deaths of Morgan Harris, Marcedes Myran, Rebecca Contois and Buffalo Woman.\n\n\u201cThis fight doesn\u2019t just aim to search the landfill. It has inspired and created waves and ripples across Turtle Island, where you will now see a new wave of grassroots advocates speak their own stories,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the whole point.\u201d\n\n1:25\nWinnipeg trial of man accused of killing 4 women starts with bid to toss jury\nJOURNALISTIC STANDARDS\nCOMMENT\nREPORT AN ERROR\n\u00a9 2024 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.\nSponsored content\nMore to Explore\nMORE FROM GLOBAL NEWS\nCanada\u2019s digital services tax is here.

(Jordy Cunningham/Capital News)\nExpand\n\nWarning: This story contains graphic descriptions and images that some may find disturbing\n\nFor Carol Archie, she has lived through the reality of Red Dress Day.\n\nArchie is the niece \u2013 from her mom\u2019s side \u2013 of a murdered Indigenous woman.\n\n\u201cShe was brutally raped and murdered and the individuals that were responsible for her death, two of them were provided small fines and one was able to walk away free, none of them had jail time. This is our reality. We were born and raised with the mindset that we have to be aware of the dangers, not out in the wilderness, in community,\u201d said Archie, who spoke at Kelowna\u2019s Red Dress Day march Friday (May 5).\n\nWhile wearing red and holding signs, the group of hundreds marched from the friendship society on Leon Avenue before eventually ending up at the Kelowna Court House to bring awareness to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) and the ongoing violent epidemic throughout North America against Indigenous women and girls.\n\nWhile Red Dress Day has been commemorated for more than a decade, Friday marked the first time the Ki-Low-Na Friendship Society held an event.\n\nIndigenous people have been targets for years and Archie still sees that today.\n\n\u201cI have the ability to be able to work for an employer that understands where I\u2019m coming from because in this day and age, my youngest daughter was followed from my work to her school,\u201d said Archie, who has two daughters, 19 and 16. \u201cI know to make certain I get to work extra early in the morning and my day ends when her day ends so that way I know I\u2019m the one driving her home and I\u2019m the one picking her up, because we are visitors on the Sylix traditional unceded territory so we don\u2019t have a lot of family here.\u201d\n\nKi-Low-Na Friendship Society executive director Edna Terbasket said it warmed her heart to see the support Friday.\n\n\u201cThe message is getting out there to many, many people,\u201d said Terbasket. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived with it for a long time as Indigenous people and when I see a lot of the folks here that are from the mainstream, I go \u2018Wow, we\u2019re getting our message out there.\u2019\u201d\n\nTerbasket explained red is symbolic because it\u2019s spiritual to Indigenous people. It also stands for the violence behind what\u2019s been happening, at the same time representing love.\n\n\u201cI think families talk more with their children about safety and even lifestyle and taking good care of themselves,\u201d said Terbasket. \u201cIt\u2019s not only Indigenous women and girls, it\u2019s all peoples. I couldn\u2019t imagine if I lost a sister or a niece or a granddaughter and she wasn\u2019t found, I couldn\u2019t imagine that. Is she alive? Is she okay? Has she been brutally assaulted or murdered?\u201d\n\nBoth Terbasket and Archie have seen tremendous growth and awareness, especially since the remains of 215 Indigenous residential school children were found in Kamloops almost two years ago.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing here today, we\u2019re becoming stronger as a people, we are being more aware of who we are as a people and how we contribute to our families, communities, and nation,\u201d said Archie. \u201cHaving this awareness across Canada and North America is huge for us, and it all started with residential school. That ripple effect comes into today and we\u2019re answering back with our own ripple effects and it\u2019s becoming more powerful.\u201d\n\nAnd for more people who want to become aware, learn, and be a part of the solution, Terbasket and Archie say to ask questions and have open conversations.\n\n\u201cWe all have to work together, collaborate together, heal together,\u201d said Terbasket.\n\nREAD MORE: West Kelowna RCMP asking for public\u2019s help in finding missing 13-year-old boy\n\nREAD MORE: From great tips to saving lives, Kelowna Uride drives into Penticton\n\n@cunninghamjordy\njordy.cunningham@kelownacapnews.com\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n\nAbout the Author: Jordy Cunningham\n\nHailing from Ladner, B.C., I have been passionate about sports, especially baseball, since I was young.

The ongoing epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and 2S+ people is a national tragedy that demands urgent action and attention.\n\nWe support the call by MP Leah Gazan and others to implement a public alert system to inform all Canadians when an Indigenous woman, girl, or 2S+ person goes missing. The Government of Canada has a duty to Indigenous peoples and must take a leadership role, financially and otherwise, in implementing an MMIWG2S+ \"Red Dress\" alert system.\n\nAnzeige\nDieser \"Fehler\" enth\u00fcllt Wachstumsaktien \u2013 20% p.a. sind m\u00f6glich.\n\n\"Eine \"falsche\" Einstellung in meiner Analyse-Software entpuppte sich als wahrer Gl\u00fccksgriff: So fand ich Aktien, die j\u00e4hrlich 20% Rendite (oder mehr) bringen.

On Red Dress Day, we honor their lives and commit ourselves to the important work of ensuring that no more Indigenous women, girls, and 2S+ people are lost to violence.\n\nMedia Contact\nFor media interviews please contact:\nHana Sabah, CAP Communications support\nCell: (514) 834-8841\nEmail: hana@impactcanada.com\n\nBackground\n\nThe Congress of Aboriginal Peoples (CAP) is the second-oldest national aboriginal organization in Canada. It was founded in 1971, one year after the AFN. CAP represents the interests of off-reserve status and non-status Indians, M\u00e9tis and Southern Inuit Aboriginal Peoples throughout Canada. CAP is one of five national Indigenous organizations recognized by the federal government, and holds consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council.\n\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/165058\n\n\u00a9\u00a02023\u00a0Newsfile Corp.\nDiesen Artikel auf Deutsch lesen\nMeistgelesene News (24 h)\nLeser\tAktuelle Nachrichten\n3.401\tKrypto Breaking News: Der Markt bricht ein - Das Spiel ist aus\n2.183\tEvotec-Aktie: Das Comeback nimmt Formen an\n2.153\t20.180 im NASDAQ 100, die n\u00e4chste Bestmarke steht!

Even the people at the event don\u2019t know a lot of information on missing and murdered Indigenous women. It\u2019s generally not talked about on campus, or in everyday life,\u201d said Taya Jardine, volunteer director at UBCO\u2019s Women\u2019s Resource Centre. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019 t know how close and how strongly impacted the local community is.\u201d\n\nJardine was referring to the five women who went missing in the North Okanagan in less than two years. The body of one, Traci Genereaux, was found on a property in Salmon Arm in October.\n\nThe tea talks are held monthly on various topics throughout the year. This one featured missing and murdered Aboriginal women and approximately 20 students shared their voices on the subject.\n\n\u201cThe main aim of the tea talks is to really get information out there; to get students involved on campus in a safe space where they can talk about their feelings and opinions on different matters,\u201d said Jardine.\n\n\u201cI feel like bringing the dresses out forces that conversation out of Indigenous communities, into settler communities as well.\u201d\n\nIndigenous women of all ages are being taken and murdered, said Jardine. \u201cSome of the people we were talking about, especially Tina Fontaine, she was 15, just in the child protective system. Other ones are mothers and could be any of us really. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to talk about.\u201d\n\nFontaine was found dead in Winnipeg\u2019s Red River in 2014. The man accused of the murder was found not guilty last week.\n\nIt\u2019s about getting the information to a generation who can make changes, she said.\n\n\u201cOn the university campus people are here to learn and aside from learning terms, it should be an environment of social learning as well.\u201d\n\nThe dress project was held by the Women\u2019s Resource Centre in partnership with the Indigenous Students Association.\n\nTo report a typo, email: edit@kelownacapnews.com.\n\n<>\n\n@carliberry_\ncarli.berry@kelownacapnews.com\nLike us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.\n\nHave a story/tip?\n\t\n Share by Email\n\t\n Share on Facebook\n\t\n Share on X\n\t\n Share on LinkedIn\n\t\n Print\n\t\nTrending\n\t\tB.C.

(Courtesy of Renee Hislop)\n\nOn Friday, May 5, students from Savory and Ruth King elementary schools and Spencer Middle School will hang red dresses across Goldstream Avenue to honour and remember missing and murdered Indigenous women, children and two-spirit people.\n\nOn Red Dress Day and National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People, the three schools will be working alongside Na\u2019tsa\u2019maht Indigenous Education, Hulitan Family and Community Services Society, and Journeys of the Heart, an Indigenous preschool, to take time to pause and reflect.\n\n\u201cWe also want to share and celebrate the strength of Indigenous women and relay how honoured women are in Indigenous culture and communities,\u201d said Renee Hislop, principal of Savory Elementary School.\n\n\u201cIt is important in our work towards Truth and Reconciliation, that we teach this to our young people in a way that tells the story of Indigenous peoples both past and present. It\u2019s really important to us that we share this truth in a way that honours but does not traumatize children. Our children are our future, and they are going to make the difference.\u201d\n\nRed Dress Day started in 2010 after artist Jaime Black\u2019s REDress project inspired the movement to pay respect to the Indigenous victims of racialized and gendered violence in Canada.\n\nSince then, May 5 has been a day to pay respect and raise awareness for the Indigenous women, children, and two-spirit people.\n\nIn 2014, the RCMP identified 1,181 Indigenous women and girls who were murdered or went missing in Canada between 1980 and 2012.\n\nStats Canada also released a report in July 2017 stating that Indigenous women represent 10 per cent of the total population of missing women in Canada while only making up 3% of Canada\u2019s total female population.\n\nALSO READ: Prime minister calls discovery of Indigenous woman in Winnipeg landfill heartbreaking\n\nHislop expresses that this year they want to \u201cbring awareness to strong female Indigenous voices and to share that Indigenous females have not and are not always treated with kindness. We want to, as a community, stand in solidarity wearing red to send a message that this is not OK, and we will work together to change this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn classrooms at Savory Elementary, they have been teaching the themes of connections Indigenous peoples have with generations before and how this is passed down through literacy. Connections between mothers and children, the strength of Indigenous women in family and community, connections to Indigenous identity and Indigenous world views,\u201d said Hislop.\n\nFriday, the community and schools will walk and drum together starting at Ruth King Elementary School at 9:45 a.m. and head to Savory Elementary School as red dresses will be seen on Goldstream Avenue along with red lights the City of Langford will display.\n\nOnce students and the community have arrived at Savory Elementary School, the school will have an assembly where female Indigenous voices Elder Shirley Alphonse, Breanne Bear, Marlene Clifton, Jo-Ina Young, and Doreen Scow share their stories. After the speeches, a tea, coffee and bannock time will commence.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDo you have a story tip?

I never heard anything about us being M\u00e9tis'\n\nAuthor of the article:\nTyler Dawson\nPublished Jul 31, 2023 \u00a0\u2022\u00a0 6 minute read\nJoin the conversation\nManitoba MLA Kevin Klein has speculated that a \"Liberal-NDP-funded government employee\" raised questions about his Indigenous identity in order to harm his reputation ahead of the October provincial election. PHOTO BY KEVIN KING/POSTMEDIA/FILE\nArticle content\n\nManitoba\u2019s environment minister is facing scrutiny over his identification as a \u201cproud M\u00e9tis Canadian,\u201d the latest in a number of prominent Canadians who\u2019ve been accused of claiming Indigenous ancestry without sufficient evidence.\n\nKevin Klein has said he\u2019s a member of the Painted Feather Woodland M\u00e9tis, but his brother and the Manitoba M\u00e9tis Federation have questioned his claims.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nTRENDING\nToo hot \u2014 Windsor Hudson's Bay could open next week after shutting for air conditioning woes\nReport: Officer described 'possible suicide' on scene where Harrow family found dead\nTiny-homes company with Windsor ties wins $1M in Housing Supply Challenge\nStorm alert: Weather watcher warns over \u2018superheated\u2019 Lake Erie\nLong overdue homecoming complete as Windsor native Matwijiw joins Spitfires as goalie coach\nArticle content\n\n\u201cIt saddened me and it brought up a lot of emotions. It brought up a lot of history,\u201d said Klein, when reached Monday morning by National Post.\n\nKlein has been a provincial legislator since 2022, and before that he served on Winnipeg\u2019s city council. At various points in his political career, he has mentioned his Indigenous ancestry \u2014 specifically in relation to his mother, Joanne Winacott, who was murdered by her second husband in 1991.\n\nIn December 2021, Klein spoke in Winnipeg council, during a debate about the police budget. He said, \u201cI have very little to say on this one, but I want to speak from a place that no one else on council can speak from.\u201d\n\nHe went on to speak about police response times.\n\n\u201cMy Indigenous mother was murdered because the police didn\u2019t respond to the initial call. That is on record in, and it\u2019s in the court documents,\u201d Klein said at the time.\n\nKlein referenced his mother\u2019s identity again on May 5, 2022, in an Instagram video for Red Dress Day, also known as the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and Two-Spirit People.\n\nHeadline News\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cMy mother was murdered by her partner, and she was Indigenous,\u201d he said.\n\nI'm not self-identifying, nor am I using it, nor am I mentioning it every time I open my mouth\n\nKlein\u2019s brother, Christopher Rout, has firmly rejected the characterization that his family has Indigenous heritage.\n\n\u201cHe never grew up M\u00e9tis. My grandparents never told us we were M\u00e9tis. I never heard anything about us being M\u00e9tis,\u201d said Rout in an interview with the National Post. \u201cThe net bottom line is we are not Aboriginal at all.\u201d\n\nKlein, who\u2019s a Progressive Conservative MLA, told National Post that he first learned of his purported M\u00e9tis ancestry when speaking with his uncle Dave. They were going through old photo albums, and his uncle asked him if he had his M\u00e9tis card, Klein said.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018No, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m M\u00e9tis,'\u201d Klein recalled. \u201cHe pulled out his card and said \u2018We are. You need to get your M\u00e9tis card because your mom never had the chance to.'\u201d\n\nKlein then applied to the Painted Feather Woodland M\u00e9tis. His understanding was that they did their own research before issuing a card.\n\n\u201cIt excited me because it\u2019s a connection I never knew,\u201d he said. \u201cI went with it because of my uncle, who I loved dearly.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe uncle, said Rout, has since died.\n\nThe allegations against Klein \u2014 that his claims of Indigenous ancestry are disputed \u2014 were first reported by CBC News, which used census records to build Klein\u2019s family tree. It found no evidence of an Indigenous ancestor.\n\nKlein said what he knows of it came from his uncle, and that the Painted Feather Woodland M\u00e9tis did their own genealogical research.\n\n\u201cThere are many Indigenous and non-(Indigenous) who are looking for clarity on their story of origin, their family history,\u201d said Klein. \u201cAnd this is something I will continue to do as a personal journey for as long as I live.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, there have been a number of prominent Canadians who have had their claims to Indigenous identity questioned, including Ellen Turpel-Lafond, who claimed to be the first Cree judge. Her claims to be a \u201cTreaty Indian\u201d have been highly disputed.\n\nThe novelist Joseph Boyden, who\u2019s best known for writing about Indigenous culture, has long claimed Indigenous ancestry, but various news reports have since disputed his claims.\n\nIn the case of Klein, his political biographies have, at various times, identified him as M\u00e9tis, although the term has recently been dropped from some of his social media accounts, CBC reported.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not self-identifying, nor am I using it, nor am I mentioning it every time I open my mouth. It is a family issue for me and a connection to my mother,\u201d Klein told CBC last fall.\n\nManitoba M\u00e9tis Federation President David Chartrand told CBC that Klein does not meet their criteria to identify as M\u00e9tis.\n\n\u201cWe do not recognize the Painted Feather Woodlands M\u00e9tis or any other group that claims M\u00e9tis identity outside our definition. This is no different than any of the other cases where groups or individuals are calling themselves M\u00e9tis when they really mean mixed heritage,\u201d Chartrand said in an email.\n\nOn Monday, Klein told the Post he has dropped the identifier in some places because, \u201cI don\u2019t mean to insult anybody. It really was a proud moment for me to believe that my family had that M\u00e9tis status.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a personal journey. I don\u2019t want to insult anybody, but I am going to follow my personal journey. And that\u2019s how we got here today,\u201d Klein said.\n\n\u201cI got into public life to serve, not to offend. To help people, not degrade them. It was never, has never, was never an attempt to make a false claim.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 6\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nKlein, who was the publisher and CEO of the Winnipeg Sun newspaper between 2007 and 2013, which is now owned by Postmedia Network Inc., speculated that a \u201cLiberal-NDP-funded government employee\u201d raised questions about his identity in order to harm his reputation ahead of the provincial election. Manitobans go to the polls in October.\n\n\u201cI can only assume it was to hurt us, to attempt to hurt us in the election when really all it did was cause more pain and sorrow for my family,\u201d Klein said.\n\nKlein\u2019s official biography, from when he was appointed to Premier Heather Stefanson\u2019s cabinet, said Klein \u201ccontinues to explore, working with Elders in Manitoba to research his connections to Indigenous community. This exploration has heightened his desire to work with Indigenous communities.\u201d\n\nA profile in What\u2019s up Winnipeg, a local magazine, reports that Klein took courses in Cree and M\u00e9tis history at the University of Alberta during COVID-19 to learn more about his roots, which he\u2019d learned about from his mother\u2019s older brother.\n\n\u201cBlond and blue-eyed Indigenous people were not uncommon among certain groups in middle America,\u201d the profile says. \u201cHis family says his roots are evident in his cheekbones, which Kevin says he could never produce a proper beard!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement 7\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nWhen reached by National Post on Monday, Rout also objected to Klein\u2019s use of their mother\u2019s experience with domestic violence, and said Klein wasn\u2019t even living at home when the domestic violence and murder occurred.\n\n\u201cAs a son, you shouldn\u2019t be trying to profit or benefit from your mom\u2019s death,\u201d said Rout.\n\nKlein said he hasn\u2019t spoken to his brother in more than 25 years. He does, however, have a relationship with their other brother, Duane.\n\nIn an email provided to the National Post by Klein\u2019s office, Duane purportedly writes that he can confirm that Klein and their Uncle Dave had a M\u00e9tis card \u2014 although the email does not go so far as to confirm Indigenous ancestry in the family.\n\n\u201cNo one knows the full history of my immediate family. I am not going into any detail because I strongly believe family matters are just that, between family,\u201d the email says. \u201cI pray my mom can Rest In Peace again.\u201d\n\nRECOMMENDED FROM EDITORIAL\nCanada's little-known contributions to the atomic bomb\nPierre Poilievre apologizes for calling $539K Niagara home a 'tiny little shack'\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.
