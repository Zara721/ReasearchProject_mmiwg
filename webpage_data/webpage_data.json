THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes\nRepublished June 15, 2020 - 2:08 PM\nOriginal Publication Date June 15, 2020 - 12:01 PM\n\nTORONTO - When someone broke into her car earlier this month, Meenakshi Mannoe knew the potential consequences of calling police.\n\nThe Vancouver resident weighed several questions: Would she get her belongings back? Was it even worth the hassle? And the tipping point: What good would it ultimately do?\n\nUltimately, Mannoe believed it wasn't a big deal \u2014 she could easily replace her lost portable speaker and first aid kit, and she questioned the impact of calling the cops on someone desperate enough to take them.\n\n\"Is it an inconvenience? Absolutely. But I don't want to contribute to the over-criminalization of folks, or hyper-policing when I know that people are doing things just to get by, just to survive.\"\n\nThe decision was an easy one for Mannoe, well-versed in the myriad systemic forces that underlie day-to-day struggles of many as a campaign staffer with Pivot Legal Society, which examines police accountability, drug policy, homelessness, and sex workers' rights.\n\nBut they're questions she says we're increasingly facing as anger-fuelled protests draw fresh scrutiny over the prevalence of police brutality and systemic racism facing Black and Indigenous people.\n\nThe weekend killing of Rodney Levi near Metepenagiag, N.B., \u2014 the second Indigenous person to die at the hands of an officer in that province in less than a month \u2014 has only intensified calls to defund the police as a part of a holistic approach to re-define public safety and how it's achieved.\n\n\"From Indigenous communities we regularly hear the sentiment that people feel over-policed and under-protected,\" Mannoe said last week, before Levi's death.\n\n\"I think this is a vital moment to really reframe what justice looks like and to heed calls from our courts like the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, or the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (national inquiry) and really look at: How do we create culturally safe and responsive Indigenous-led crisis intervention?\"\n\nThe defund movement doesn't mean abolishing police \u2014 although there are calls for that, too \u2014 but rather is an acknowledgment that law enforcement has ballooned to encompass far-ranging responsibilities it's incapable of addressing, says Toronto city councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam, who will introduce a motion later this month to cut Toronto's police budget by 10 per cent.\n\n\"In some ways, we have set them up to fail,\" says Wong-Tam, noting calls often involve people in the throes of a mental health crisis or substance abuse.\n\n\"Asking police officers to be the social worker that shows up on the doorstep armed with guns and pepper spray, I just don't think that has given us always the best outcome.\"\n\nLevi was killed Friday night after RCMP say they responded to a complaint about an \"unwanted person\" at a home near Metepenagiag, about 30 kilometres west of Miramichi. Officers say they were confronted by a man carrying knives, and tried to subdue him with a stun gun. Levi was ultimately shot by an officer and declared dead in hospital.\n\nSince then, Chief Bill Ward of the Metepenagiag Mi'kmaq Nation has said Levi was an invited guest at the home, where he had planned to seek guidance from a church minister.\n\nThen there are the deaths of Chantel Moore, an Indigenous woman in Edmundston, N.B., who was shot by police who had come to perform a wellness check, and Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a Black woman who fell from her Toronto balcony after family members called police to her home.\n\nThe circumstances around each case have not been disclosed and are being examined by independent police investigation agencies. But experts say they highlight the myriad ways racial bias and mental-health stigma can make any police interaction dangerously fraught.\n\nEspecially for someone who is Black, Indigenous or a person of colour, the very presence of an armed officer could aggravate an already delicate situation, says the James R. Johnston chair in Black Canadian studies at Dalhousie University.\n\n\"When you have experiences, for example, in Toronto where Black men are 20 times more likely to be harmed or killed by police than (white) people, then yes, of course we're going to be anxious,\" says OmiSoore Dryden.\n\n\"And, you know, we don't all teach our children, 'Go to police,' that they will help them if they're lost or whatever,\" said Dryden. \"We know not to do that.\"\n\nDryden says the very inception of policing was rooted in protecting property, which further institutionalized racism by enforcing slavery.\n\n\"It meant in the creation of this country, that those Black people fleeing slavery were captured and returned into slavery and those Black people who were freed were often trafficked into slavery, even though they weren't slaves,\" she says.\n\n\"For many that uniform is a symbol of harm and abuse and fear. It is not a symbol for care and kindness and support.\"\n\nJust like the rest of society, police officers are vulnerable to conscious and unconscious biases that can cloud their judgment, says Jennifer Lavoie, an associate professor in criminology at Wilfrid Laurier University.\n\n\"That becomes problematic when you're a police officer and you have implicit biases that involve perceptions of threat or aggression or violence that are attached to specific populations such as BIPOC populations,\" says Lavoie.\n\n\"When you're approaching and providing services to a person they're more than their mental health crisis. It's important to approach that person holistically.\"\n\nNevertheless, calling 911 is the only option most people have when faced with a public safety crisis, even when someone is clearly in mental distress, Lavoie says.\n\nMost cities have a patchwork of additional services that can respond to some emergency calls, but they are inconsistent and not always 24-hours, she notes.\n\nLavoie would like to see more funding for crisis intervention teams that many police services have across the country.\n\nIn Toronto, they're known as Mobile Crisis Intervention Teams, or MCIT, and involve a mental health nurse and a specially trained police officer. But they respond only if it's clear a weapon is not involved or if first-responding officers deems it safe for a nurse to arrive. Citizens also cannot call MCIT directly.\n\nWong-Tam says they are also overwhelmed by demand, noting the force receives roughly 30,000 calls a year related to mental health but that the MCIT only respond to about 6,000 calls a year.\n\nHamilton's Crisis Outreach and Support Team, known as COAST, includes a mobile team of a mental health professional and a plain-clothes police officer in an unmarked car, but it, too, is not 24-hours.\n\n\"There is a period of time where they're not available, and if they're on call, there's only so many units that are available,\" Lavoie says.\n\nIn Vancouver, Car 87 teams a police constable with a registered nurse or a registered psychiatric nurse to provide on-site assessments. Meanwhile, nurses can also help callers to a crisis line and triage situations to Car 87, ambulance or police.\n\nAs part of her research, Lavoie says she's developed a 40-hour training program being tested with Durham Region police in Ontario that uses scenario-based exercises with actors who portray \"authentic mental health crises.\"\n\n\"That's the only way to really, I think, train officers on how to respond to a person in mental health crisis.\"\n\nFormer Ottawa cop-turned-professor Greg Brown, of Carleton University's department of law & legal studies, says police training includes just a cursory overview of mental health conditions but that more robust education isn't the answer.\n\nHe'd like to see a portion of police funds reallocated to some sort of social services department within the force that could respond to such calls, but he'd also like to see \"more use-of-force training, so they can perform more professionally.\"\n\nHe says most police services dedicate 10 to 12 hours a year towards firearms and hand-to-hand fighting skills.\n\n\"We have police officers that are rusty at use-of-force and then you have an incident where they have to use force and they don't perform properly,\" he says.\n\n\"And then people wonder, 'Why? Why does that officer behave like that? Aren't they trained?' And the answer is, 'Not really.'\"\n\nWong-Tam would like to see funds diverted to affordable housing, career counselling, skills training, recreation youth programs and mental-health crisis support. She says a 10 per cent budget cut in Toronto would yield $122 million.\n\nMannoe agrees that addressing society's myriad inequalities would do more to reduce police interactions to begin with, but so, too, would a broader understanding of systemic forces that affect police and society's ability to hold them accountable.\n\n\"I think people are looking for this kind of big alternative system that's going to replace police but really it's just (about) turning our minds towards compassion for people who are in a bad place.\"\n\n\u2014 With files from Adina Bresge\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 15, 2020.\n\nNote to readers: This is a corrected story. A previous version said Meenakshi Mannoe considered calling the police. In fact, she knew she did not want to call the police.\n\nNews from \u00a9 The Canadian Press, 2020\n\n\nMore News ...\niN RESPONSE: Readers have their say\nFollowing are emailed reader responses to stories or letters to the...\niN VIDEO: Iconic A&W whistle dog returns after fans made enough noise\nThailand's prime minister wants to outlaw cannabis, 2 years after it was decriminalized\n$11 million commercial property for sale near downtown Kelowna\nPopular Penticton News\nAnother BC nurse suspended for snooping on medical records\nMay 19, 2024 6:30 AM\nBC transwoman scores minor human rights victory against Ministry of Health\nMay 19, 2024 7:00 PM\nFiddling with timesheet nets BC nurse $23,000 in pay and a suspension\nMay 20, 2024 6:00 AM\niN PHOTOS: Okanagan's hot rods gathered in West Kelowna for World of Wheels\nMay 19, 2024 4:15 PM\nOne woman\u2019s battle for long-term care in Interior Health for elderly family members\nMay 18, 2024 7:00 AM\nTop News\nCooler, wetter weather reduces wildfire activity in northeast B.C.\nMay 21, 2024 1:08 PM\nDefense rests without ex-President Trump taking the witness stand in his New York hush money trial\nMay 21, 2024 1:04 PM\n'Happy tears' of victim's sister after prison attack on serial killer Robert Pickton\nMay 21, 2024 12:52 PM\nThe Latest | UN food aid collapses in Rafah as Israeli leaders decry war crime accusations\nMay 21, 2024 12:22 PM\niN RESPONSE: Readers have their say\nMay 21, 2024 12:00 PM\nTrending Now\nTRENDING NOW: Gentle kittens don't know how to fight\nKamloops\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nKamloops Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nKelowna\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nKelowna Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nPenticton\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nPenticton Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\nVernon\nHome\nNews\nLocal\nBC\nBusiness\nCanada\nCorrections\nFYI\nTop News\nTrending Now\nWorld\nWeird\nVernon Weather\nThings to Do\nGalleries\nGolf Courses\nMuseums\nParks & Beaches\nSnow Sports\nWineries\nSports\nCFL\nCurling\nFigure Skating\nMLB\nNBA\nNFL\nNHL\nSoccer\nLifestyle\nDiet & Fitness\nFood\nHealth\nHoroscopes\nParenting\nTravel\nEntertainment\nBooks\nCelebrities\nMovies\nMusic\nTV\nEvents\nBusiness Search\nPeople Search\nReverse Lookup\nRestaurants\nGovernment Listings\nPostal Codes\n\u00a9 2024 InfoTel News Ltd\nContact iNFOTEL MULTIMEDIA |\u00a0\nContact iNFOnews |\u00a0\nSubmit News Tips |\u00a0\nPrivacy Policy & Disclaimer |\u00a0\nSitemap |\u00a0\nNewsletter Signup\nView Site in: Desktop | Mobile"

PHOTO BY JASON PAYNE /PNG\nArticle content\n\nCapilano University sits on unceded Squamish and Tsleil Waututh territory on the forested slopes of North Vancouver, the school\u2019s walls and grounds festooned with Coast Salish art, so it\u2019s fitting it now has its first director of Indigenous education and affairs.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nMiranda Huron started her new job last week, returning to B.C. after helping Bill C-91, the Indigenous Languages Act, become federal law last summer in her role with the Assembly of First Nations (AFN).\n\nWith B.C. having just become the first province to implement the UN Declaration of Indigenous Rights (UNDRIP), it\u2019s an exciting time to take up the position, Huron, who is Anishinaabe, said.\n\nArticle content\n\n\u201cTo be working at this institution in this new era is amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity, a great time to be here.\n\n\u201cHaving learned so much from the AFN, having heard from chiefs across the country with their priorities, especially regarding post-secondary, bringing that here and getting to form new relationships with the five nations from Cap U, to have full partnerships and full understanding of what it means to be a good partner going forward.\u201d\n\nCanucks Report\n\nEssential reading for hockey fans who eat, sleep,

content\n\nHuron, 41, said she\u2019ll use the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s calls-to-action, the call to justice in the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls investigation, and UNDRIP as guideposts to navigate the path to developing mutual respect and inclusion on campus.\n\nThat includes curriculum, staffing, more Indigenous students.\n\n\u201cEvery step of the way,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re right on Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh territory, for them to be able to come here \u2026 the student success rate when being able to be closer to home is amazing, so it would be lovely for us to be their first choice and to provide responsive curriculum for their needs.\u201d\n\nIt was a winding path that brought her back to B.C.\n\nA trip to Vancouver as a 13-year-old convinced Huron she wanted to live here, leading to undergraduate and Master\u2019s degrees from UBC.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nShe has two decades experience at post-secondary institutions, including manager of Ch\u2019nook Indigenous business education at UBC\u2019s Sauder School of Business, and stints at Emily Carr and Algonquin College.\n\nHaving moved all over Ontario as a child \u2014 \u201cMy mother was a bit of a hippy\u201d \u2014 Huron herself moved around the globe, surfing in Australia, cycling 6,000 kilometres across Canada, 5,700 kilometres in Russia from Vladivostok to Novosibirsk before her bike broke down, and 10,000 kilometres in Africa from Cairo to Cape Town.\n\nIt helps that she speaks about a dozen languages.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been sort of work-work, travel-travel,\u201d she said.\n\nHer position was created, the president of Cap U said, as an important next step to further deepen the university\u2019s response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s calls-to-action and UNDRIP.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cUniversities have an essential role to play in reconciliation,\u201d Paul Dangerfield said.\n\nCapilano\u2019s First Nations student services centre, K\u00e9xwusm-\u00e1yakn (Squamish for \u201ca place to meet\u201d) opened in 2013.\n\nThe university itself is named after Chief Joe Capilano, also known as Joe Mathias or Sa7plek (Sahp-luk), who stood up for Indigenous rights and culture as a Skwxw\u00fa7mesh (Squamish) leader from 1895 to his death in 1910.\n\nHuron can\u2019t wait to roll up her sleeves, can\u2019t wait to start the process of inclusion for the\u00a0Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh, Musqueam, Lil\u2019wat and Sechelt (sh\u00edsh\u00e1lh) Nations.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m learning is there are a lot of people here who are keen to take this on,\u201d Huron said. \u201cTo really move projects forward that have been waiting in the wings, ideas that have been talked about for a lot of years that need impetus.\u201d\n\ngordmcintyre@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/gordmcintyre\n\nArticle

If you played hockey against a team from a reserve in the 1960s you will know what I mean about reverse racism.\u201d\n\nBrown then goes on to say that governments and Indigenous councils only want to handle problems by throwing money at them, then asks what Indigenous chiefs and councils are doing to improve their people\u2019s economic conditions and address addiction issues.\u00a0\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, for the rest of Canada, we have a prime minister who would rather reconcile (pay them what they want) than make an attempt to change the status quo,\u201d Brown wrote.\n\nThe former mayor, who lost last year\u2019s election, then seems to defend the Sixties Scoop, writing \u201cIt is suggested now that we pay each child who was taken from a bad situation and given to a non-Indigenous family the sum of $40,000. How many of these children would have died if they had been left with their family?\u201d\n\nAfter bringing up how many Indigenous children are born with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and the suicide crisis many Indigenous communities are facing, Brown concludes by saying: \u201cHaving no future is the problem and this is something that needs to be addressed and certainly is more important than building casinos and gas stations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis opinion, written by the former mayor of Rossburn no less, contained nothing but racist stereotyping, false equivalence, ignorance and misinformation,\u201d Chief Clearsky wrote in his response. \u201cI sincerely hope that this opinion does not represent or influence how our neighbours view our people and our community.\u201d\n\nClearsky then recommends that people who share Brown\u2019s opinions read the reports from the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples and the National Inquiry Into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls to understand what he calls the \u201cbroken relationship\u201d between Indigenous peoples and Canada and the impact of the country\u2019s colonial history.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe are not weak.

We survived,\" she said in an interview at the studio she maintains in Ignacio, Colorado.\n\nHudson, who is from Sheep Springs, New Mexico, learned to sew at 9 years old. It is a skill she learned from her mother, who was forced to sew while attending boarding schools operated by the federal government.\n\nHudson is the first Navajo quilter to break into juried Native American arts shows by\u00a0winning first-place prizes in textiles and best-of-show titles.\n\n\"Every time I win a ribbon, I'm representing Sheep Springs. I'm representing Navajo Nation. I'm representing our grandmas,\" said Hudson, who is\u00a0Kinyaa'a\u0301anii (Towering House Clan), born for Deeshchi\u0301i\u0301'nii (Apache People Clan).\n\nHer maternal grandfather clan is Ta\u0301ba\u0328a\u0328ha\u0301 (Water's Edge), and her parental grandfather clan is Naakai dine'e\u0301 (Mexican Clan).\n\nThrough the years, Hudson's style has evolved from star quilts to incorporating her interest in ledger drawings. Ledger art works are representational designs produced by Plains tribes using pencil, ink or watercolor\u00a0on pages of ledger, or accounting books.\n\nThese pictorial quilts can take up to 18 months to complete, including sewing by machine and sewing details and binding by hand.\n\nHudson\u00a0explained the process includes developing the designs. Most are\u00a0based on dreams she has of her ancestors, who tell her\u00a0their experiences and stories.\n\nCarolyn Ducey, curator of collections at the International Quilt Museum in Lincoln, Nebraska, said in the episode that there are 6-10 million quilters in the United States and it is a $3.7 billion industry.\n\n\"People who love to do it, love it with a passion,\" Ducey said in the program.\n\nHudson became involved with \"Craft in America\"\u00a0after Carol Sauvion, the show's executive producer and director, saw her quilt, \"Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Since 1492,\" at the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe in 2018.\n\nA film crew spent three days with Hudson in May. They captured her quilting in Ignacio and in Sheep Springs, where she gathered with relatives and a quilters group from Cove, Arizona.\n\nThe segment featuring Hudson opens with a shot of her quilt entitled, \"29 Warriors,\" which has horses made of various colors of fabric surrounding a star pattern.\n\nThe star's center consists of the colors white, turquoise, yellow and black, which Hudson explained are the colors for Dine\u0301 College, and the quilt is in honor of the 29 original Navajo Code Talkers.\n\nShe acknowledges that some people are puzzled by her sewing star quilts\u00a0\u2013 a pattern adapted and stylized by the Lakota people.\n\nWhen asked what she would like viewers to understand about her art, she said she wants them to realize that she is Navajo but that does not pigeonhole her to art associated with the tribe.\n\n\"That's what I want them to know, that I'm taking pride in being Navajo. That I was chosen to be this. That I was chosen to do this. That door was open for me, and I ran through it,\" she said.\n\n\"Craft in America: Quilts\" will broadcast on New Mexico PBS Channel 5.1 at 9 p.m. on Dec. 27.\n\nNoel Lyn Smith covers the Navajo Nation for The Daily Times.

Subscribe to our daily local news wrap.\nBy Canadian Press\nInuit women in Canada\u2019s North encountering \u2018racialized policing,\u2019 report says\nJan 17, 2020 | 11:10 PM\n\n\n\nOTTAWA \u2014 A national organization representing Inuit women in Canada is calling for a radical shift in the way police work is done in the North.\n\nThe demand comes after\u00a0a new\u00a0report\u00a0released Thursday described \u201csystemic racialized policing\u201d in the Arctic.\n\nPauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada and Elizabeth Comack, a sociology and criminology professor at the University of Manitoba, co-authored the report, which examined how police respond to violence against women in Canada\u2019s traditional Inuit territory, known\u00a0as Inuit Nunangat.\n\nThe report says that interviews with about 45 Inuit women, and nearly as many service providers, revealed many women encounter such high rates of gender-based violence they have come to expect it in their lives.\n\nThe authors home in on actions of police officers\u00a0responding to cases of domestic violence in these regions,\u00a0with women saying they are often not believed when reporting abuse.\n\nSometimes,\u00a0according to the report, the\u00a0women reporting the violence, rather than\u00a0their abusers, are the ones removed from their\u00a0homes.\n\n\u201cRacialized policing persists in Inuit women\u2019s encounters with the justice system and it goes well beyond a few individual officers holding stereotypes about Inuit,\u201d said Rebecca Kudloo, president of Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada.\n\n\u201cPolice can respond more effectively to gendered violence by adopting a \u2018decolonizing framework\u2019 that helps officers move from being an outside force to becoming more integrated with northern communities they serve.\u201d\n\nWomen in Nunavut are the victims of violent crime at a rate more than 13 times higher than women in Canada as a whole and are 12 times more likely to be sexually assaulted than in other provinces and territories, according to data cited by the report.\n\nAlso, in 2016, Nunavut had the highest rate of female victims of police-reported family violence in Canada, with the Northwest Territories coming in second.\n\nInuit women from across Inuit Nunangat \u2014 including Nunavut, the\u00a0Inuvialuit Settlement\u00a0Region\u00a0of the Northwest Territories, Nunavik in northern Quebec and Nunatsiavut of Newfoundland and Labrador\u00a0\u2014 told the study\u2019s authors they\u00a0feel\u00a0victimized by police protocols when they do\u00a0report incidents of abuse.\n\nThe RCMP said in a statement Thursday\u00a0it could not comment directly on the findings in the report because it had just been released.\n\nBut spokeswoman Catherine Fortin did outline steps the national police force is taking to reduce and respond to gender-based violence, including a new online training course, which is\u00a0currently being developed, to teach officers how to deal sensitively with victims of trauma when conducting investigations, especially in cases of gender-based violence.\u00a0\n\nThe course\u00a0will be available to RCMP staff in weeks, Fortin said.\n\nThe report also emphasizes the historical context of the gendered violence that has been experienced by Inuit women over many decades, arguing it has been perpetrated or exacerbated in many cases by RCMP officers. It provides a detailed account of how Mounties were involved in moving Inuit people to permanent settlements and transporting children to residential schools.\n\nThis echoes findings of\u00a0the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, which was highly critical of the RCMP\u2019s overall dealings with Indigenous peoples and communities. The inquiry\u00a0made\u00a0note of many of the same\u00a0concerns\u00a0and gaps in policing\u00a0services for Inuit in the Arctic.\n\nThe federal government has said it will release its national plan to respond to the\u00a0inquiry findings\u00a0by June.\n\nFurther findings in the new study highlight concerns about inadequate dispatching systems in Arctic regions. A panel of women from all four\u00a0Inuit\u00a0regions held in Ottawa Thursday shared their urgent concerns about emergency calls being transferred to regional dispatching offices, slowing responses.\n\n\u2018When a woman is being beaten up and calls the police, how long do they wait?\u201d Kudloo said. \u201cWhen a woman is in danger, she needs somebody right there as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nThe authors of the study found that officers spend limited stints in particular communities. This,\u00a0coupled with many officers\u2019 lack of knowledge of the Inuit language, has created a perception that police\u00a0are outsiders \u2014 fuelling a widespread feeling of distrust.\n\nParticipants did note the challenges faced by police officers in the regions, including having to respond\u00a0to\u00a0high-risk situations of domestic violence with backup sometimes hours away.\n\nNunavut New Democrat MP Mumilaaq Qaqqaq called the report \u201cdamning\u201d and called on the Liberal government to take swift action to address systemic issues in the North that can lead to violence, such as poor housing and mental-health services.\n\n\u201cIt is shameful that the federal government has failed to uphold the basic human rights of the people of Nunavut by refusing them housing and health care that could prevent this violence and often loss of life,\u201d Qaqqaq said.\n\n\u201cWe see a lot more cultural programs for women, but we also need to provide men opportunities for cultural healing to address intergenerational trauma and have healthy outlets to break the cycles of violence. We need to do better. People\u2019s lives count on it.\u201d\n\nThe report comes with 15 recommendations, including calling for a\u00a0cultural shift in policing to adapt to Inuit tradition and history in these regions. That should involve\u00a0police officers becoming more connected and integrated into their communities, the report says.\n\nIt also calls for more female police officers, more Inuit civilian positions in policing to help with healing and translation and for the RCMP to revisit its posting terms\u00a0for northern officers.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 16, 2020.\n\nTeresa Wright, The Canadian Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby Canadian Press\nAround the Web\nCanadians Born 1944-1984 Could Be Eligible for This Benefit\nDollarGuardian\nA Teaspoon on an Empty Stomach Can Remove Parasites!\nParasiteRelief\nExpert Says This Drugstore Wrinkle Cream is Actually Worth It\nNeotonics\nThe Main Cause of Wrinkles on the Face!

Family Photo/Supplied\nArticle content\n\nOTTAWA \u2014 The case of an Ontario trucker acquitted in the death of an Alberta woman referred to at trial as a \u201cNative\u201d and a \u201cprostitute\u201d is to go before the Supreme Court this week in what could set a precedent in Canada\u2019s sexual assault laws.\n\nAdvertisement 2\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nBradley Barton says Cindy Gladue died after a night of consensual, rough sex in an Edmonton motel in June 2011. Her body was found in the bathtub after Barton called 911. She had an 11-centimetre cut in her vagina and had bled to death.\n\nA jury found Barton not guilty of first-degree murder and manslaughter. The Crown appealed following nationwide protests and the Alberta Court of Appeal ordered a new trial.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe Appeal Court ruled serious errors were made in the original trial and in the judge\u2019s charge to the jury about Barton\u2019s conduct and on sexual assault legislation as it pertains to consent.\n\nThe Supreme Court is to hear arguments Thursday on several procedural matters, including the role of interveners, but may also decide for the first time whether an \u201cobjective likelihood of harm\u201d cancels out sexual consent.\n\nCalgary Sun Headline News\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\nSign Up\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nArticle content\nAdvertisement 3\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe Alberta Crown, as well as attorney generals in other provinces, including Ontario, is arguing for such an addition to the law.\n\nBarton\u2019s lawyer, Dino Bottos, says it would be a big deal if the top court agrees. He plans to argue that the Crown brought up the consent versus harm argument on appeal \u2014 not at trial \u2014 and it shouldn\u2019t affect his client\u2019s case.\n\nIt would be akin to double jeopardy, Bottos says. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to hold the line.\u201d\n\nLise Gotell is a gender studies professor at the University of Alberta and chairwoman of the Women\u2019s Legal Education and Action Fund, or LEAF, one of 16 groups intervening in the Barton case. She points out the court has previously ruled that a person killed in a fist fight couldn\u2019t have consented to bodily harm.\n\nAdvertisement 4\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\n\u201cBut the court has never made a ruling on whether or not this rule applies in a sexual context.\u201d\n\nThe Barton case is complicated, says Gotell, who adds that LEAF won\u2019t argue for the new consent provision because it believes Gladue didn\u2019t agree at all.\n\nBarton has testified that he hired Gladue for two nights of sex that included putting his fist in her vagina. When he woke up after the second night, he said, he found her dead in the tub.\n\nA medical examiner testified that the wound to Gladue\u2019s vaginal wall was likely to have been caused by a sharp object and, in a rare move, he used Gladue\u2019s preserved vaginal tissue as an exhibit.\n\nThat was disrespectful and dehumanizing, says Gotell, as were the comments from lawyers who referred to Gladue more than two dozen times before the jury as a native prostitute.\n\nAdvertisement 5\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW\nArticle content\n\nThe 36-year-old Metis woman was a mother of three girls. She struggled with addiction and poverty and deserved better, says a factum filed by lawyers with another intervener \u2014 the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\n\n\u201cWe recall her strength and dignity now, because the trial in relation to her death failed to do so,\u201d it says.\n\nMuriel Stanley Venne, founder of the Institute for the Advancement of Aboriginal Women, a co-intervener with LEAF, says there\u2019s never been a better time, in light of the #MeToo movement, for a case like this to be heard.\n\n\u201cI believe this is the most important case in my lifetime,\u201d says Venne, who is 80. \u201cOur Cindy Gladue is the embodiment and the hero that we are looking for to change the conduct of the court.\u201d\n\nArticle content\nShare this article in your social network\nStop Buying Lottery Tickets & Start Doing This Instead!\nYukon\n|\nSponsored\nClick Here\nSUNshine Girl Kassey\nCalgary Sun\nSUNshine Girl Nicole\nCalgary Sun\nSeniors Say Goodbye To Expensive Car Insurance If You Live In These Postal Codes\nAuto Insurance\n|\nSponsored\nEdmonton: $75,000 Disability Grant for You\nNational Disability Credit Alliance\n|\nSponsored\nApply Now\nCanadians Under Age 84 With No Life Insurance Are Taking Advantage Of This\nCovered For Life\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nPeople Born 1944-1984 Could Apply For This Benefit\nSeniors Choice\n|\nSponsored\nRead More\nCOMMENTS\nYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.\nCreate an Account\nSign in\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION\nSeniors over 70 May Pay Next To Nothing For Life Insurance Because Of This\nCovered For Life\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nStop Buying Lottery Tickets & Start Doing This Instead\nYukon Casino\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nPut Baking Soda in the Toilet, Here's Why\nLifeHackGuru\n|\nSponsored\nAlberta Seniors Are Eligible For A Free Hearing Test (Here's how)\nConnect Hearing\n|\nSponsored\nForget Anti-Ageing Cream, Us\u0435 This Household Item To Fill In Wrinkles\nNeotonics\n|\nSponsored\nTry Now\nMOST POPULAR\nSUNshine Girl Brittany\nCalgary Sun\nMOST POPULAR\nSUNshine Girl Kimberly\nCalgary Sun\nOne Teaspoon Every Night Burns Body Fat Like Never Before, You Will Fit In Your Pants Again!\nBurn Belly Fat\n|\nSponsored\nTRENDING\nSuspected copper theft again cuts internet, phone service for thousands of Calgarians\nLetters May 21, 2024: 'Justin just doesn't get it, we're tired of taxes.'\nSUNshine Girl Danielle\nMan in non-life-threatening condition after suffering multiple gunshot wounds\nGuide to the NHL\u2019s Final Four for Calgary Flames fans\nREAD NEXT\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLATEST NATIONAL STORIES\nTHIS WEEK IN FLYERS"

The column was posted on the popular Canadian news aggregator, National Newswatch, and then it took off from there.\n\nPiers Morgan and Gerald Butts got into a scrap on Twitter. Photograph courtesy of Wikipedia Commons and The Hill Times file photograph\n\nBut Mr. Trudeau later clarified that the remark was a \u201cdumb joke\u201d that appeared to have went over fine at the event but \u201cdidn\u2019t play so well\u201d out of context. It also sounded more like he was teasing the questioner who was telling Mr. Trudeau that she\u2019d like to share the message of \u201cGod the Mother,\u201d and said \u201cmaternal love is the love that\u2019s going to change the future of mankind,\u201d to which Mr. Trudeau said, \u201cWe\u2019d like to say \u2018peoplekind,\u2019 not necessarily mankind, because it\u2019s more inclusive.\u201d\n\nGerald Butts, the PM\u2019s principal secretary, tweeted at Ms. Morgan on Feb. 8: \u201cYou have joined a lovely international club,\u201d copying a previous tweet he posted commenting on a video of the woman who heckled Mr. Trudeau at his town hall in Hamilton being interviewed by controversial alt-right activist Jack Posibiec.\n\nMr. Morgan, who has 6.4 million Twitter followers, didn\u2019t take too kindly to being lumped in with the notorious alt-right, which is often conflated with white nationalism and the neo-Nazi movement, and accused Mr. Butts, who has 40,000 Twitter followers, of being, er, not the brightest lightbulb in the room.\n\n\u201cThe whole world laughed at your boss & his absurdly politically correct, virtue-signalling #peoplekind nonsense,\u201d Mr. Morgan posted on Twitter.\n\n\u201cIf you choose to condemn everyone who did so as being a Nazi, then I politely suggest you\u2019re a complete & utter halfwit.\u201d\n\nMr. Morgan then tweeted: \u201cMr. Butts is what we Brits would call \u2018one sandwich short of a full picnic.\u2019 Incredible that someone so close to your prime minister is able to spout such dangerously inflammatory nonsense on his behalf.\u201d This particular tweet was retweeted 834 times and was favourited by 1,826 people. \u201ca) I\u2019m not a Nazi. b) It wasn\u2019t a joke. c) If you\u2019re one of @JustinTrudeau\u2019s chief advisers, no wonder he\u2019s making so many gaffes.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a good week for Mr. Trudeau. The Toronto Star ran a front-page column on Feb. 7 by entertainment columnist Vinay Menon headlined, \u201cFor the sake of peoplekind, Justin Trudeau needs to shut his mouth,\u201d and The Washington Post\u2019s Molly Roberts wrote a column on Feb. 7 headlined, \u201cForget \u2018peoplekind.\u2019 There\u2019s a lot else wrong with Justin Trudeau,\u201d criticizing not only Mr. Trudeau\u2019s flat town hall performance, but his government\u2019s $233-million deal to sell 16 combat helicopters to the Philippines.\n\nCP\u2019s Kristy Kirkup welcomes baby Hazel, and she already missed her deadline by four days\nCanadian Press\u2019 Kristy Kirkup has given birth to her daughter baby Hazel and she\u2019s super cute.

The Hill Times file photograph\n\nDuff Conacher, co-founder of Democracy Watch, launched a Federal Court challenge on Jan. 19 against former lobbying commissioner Karen Shepherd\u2019s decision that the Aga Khan did not break lobbying rules.\n\nMs. Shepherd\u2019s decision indicated that the Aga Khan did not break lobbying rules when he vacationed with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the Bahamas.\n\nThe CBC reported that Ms. Shepherd had determined that the Aga Khan was not paid by the foundation to lobby, meaning his interactions with Mr. Trudeau were not covered by the Lobbyists Code of Conduct.\n\n\u201cAfter reviewing the information provided to me in the administrative review report, I have come to the conclusion that the Aga Khan receives no payment for his work on behalf of the Aga Khan Foundation Canada and, therefore, does not engage in activities requiring registration as a lobbyist,\u201d Ms. Shepherd wrote in a letter obtained by the CBC.\n\nMr. Conacher, however, argued the ruling was \u201clegally incorrect\u201d and \u201cviolates the spirit and purpose of the Lobbyists\u2019 Code of Conduct.\n\n\u201c[It] opens up a huge loophole that big businesses and other organizations will exploit by having their unregistered board members or staff do favours for, and give gifts to, politicians and government officials they are lobbying as a way of unethically influencing their policy making decisions,\u201d Mr. Conacher said in a statement.\n\nsshekar@hilltimes.com\n\n@shruti_shekar\n\n\u00a0\nSee all stories BY SHRUTI SHEKAR\n \nMORE NEWS\nO\u2019Regan names acting comms head, hires new issues manager\nFEATUREBY LAURA RYCKEWAERT\nLive, from Parliament Hill!

Among other duties, SANE nurses collect evidence after sexual and domestic assaults.\n\nJennifer Cumpsty, Shared Health\u2019s executive director for acute care, said at a news conference Wednesday that a group of physicians and nurse practictioners have come forward to \u2014 for the time being \u2014 cover the program\u2019s gaps so the hospital can continue to provide care for survivors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting in place today the process if there is not a trained nurse on duty, what the steps will be to activate the backup plan to come in and see those patients,\u201d Cumpsty said.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a team working on how we will notify someone who\u2019s the backup.\n\n\u201cSo if there\u2019s a SANE nurse on duty, they would be notified as soon as that patient was medically cleared and ready for the exam, and the process that the team is working on right now is how we will notify the physicians that are going to be the backup.\u201d\n\n1:22\nMore nurses quit Manitoba service for sexual assault victims amid ongoing staffing issues\n\nLast spring, Manitoba Health Minister Audrey Gordon announced $640,000 in provincial funding to hire five full-time forensic nurse examiners for the program, including a provincial co-ordinator.\n\nThe latest health and medical news emailed to you every Sunday.\n\nShared Health says six new permanent positions have been filled, but due to the intensive training needed, they won\u2019t start working until June.\n\nEarlier this year, Global News learned from Shared Health that 14 victims had been turned away from HSC within a nine-month period.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey were told not to shower and to come back later when a nurse was available to examine them.\n\nThe Manitoba Nurses Union has been vocal in its concerns over staffing woes and the impact the lack of support can have on both workers and their patients. The province\u2019s Opposition NDP has called for Gordon\u2019s resignation over the crisis.\n\nOn Thursday, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs expressed what it said is \u201cdeep concern\u201d over the resignations, calling on government to return the program to its full capacity as soon as possible.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAMC pointed out the focus on victims of interpersonal violence in the final report of the National Inquiry Into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, and that First Nations individuals continue to be disproportionately targeted for this type of violence.\n\n\u201cIt is incredibly disheartening to know that an essential program that is supposed to be a safe, supportive, and an affirming option for those victims who has experienced unimaginable trauma, has now become a source of frustration, disappointment and re-victimization,\u201d Grand Chief Cathy Merrick said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the province must intervene immediately to re-examine the ailing health care system, starting with re-assessing the sexual assault nurse examiner program so that those who need it, can confidently be treated with care and compassion and know their assessments will be done efficiently and without inflicting further trauma.\u201d\n\n0:18\nManitoba Nurses Union demands support for sexual assault examiner units\nJOURNALISTIC STANDARDS\nCOMMENT\nREPORT AN ERROR\n\u00a9 2023 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.\nSponsored content\nMore to Explore\nWHAT IS OUTBRAIN\nMORE FROM GLOBAL NEWS\nER visits among seniors rose after cannabis legalization, study finds\nWildfires and air quality: How to check the reading in your area\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe News on CJOB\n3:00 PM - 6:00 PM\nCJOB\nTrending\nSerial killer Robert Pickton attacked in Quebec prison\n24,559\nREAD\nHere\u2019s how to prevent tick bites and safely remove them\n21,741\nREAD\nInflation continues to cool.

Hallikas said both of them felt that in order to convey their thanks for the invites, they would in turn help out with the cooking beforehand.\n\n\u201cWe arrived shortly before noon and spent the next three-and-a-half-hours over a deep fryer cooking potatoes,\u201d Hallikas said.\n\n\u201cAnd I do have to say those potatoes were delicious. But what I really wanted to comment on was this was the 51st annual fish fry put on by Rainy River First Nations. Rainy River First Nations for 51 years gave been feeding friends and neighbours, and the feast was amazing. To me, one of the most generous things anyone can do is to share what they have with others, particularly their food. I\u2019m so deeply grateful to Chief Horton and Council and all the members of Rainy River First Nations for their generous and gracious gesture of friendship to their friends and neighbours. What an example they\u2019re setting for all of us for the past 51 years.\u201d\n\nJoin our Newsletter\n\n\n\n\nSIGN-UP\n\nWhile the mayor did not choose to read his entire report to council aloud, his written report also noted that he has been taking part in many meetings and other community events.\n\nThe mayor attended the Walk for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls held in Rainy River First Nations on May 5, which he said had an impressive turnout as the group made its way from the band office to the powwow grounds.\n\nSenior Games\n\nIn other community events, the mayor also made a showing at some of the Ontario Senior Games that were held here throughout the month of May.\n\n\u201cI was impressed with the number and variety of the games that the seniors could compete in,\u201d Hallikas wrote.\n\n\u201cFor a modest entry fee, seniors could take part in any number of events. Winners, should they choose, can move up and represent Fort Frances at the All\u2010Ontario Senior Games. The games wound up with a banquet on Thursday evening. I would like to compliment and thank the organizers and volunteers for putting on a much needed, exciting, and excellent set of games. Our community has an aging demographic and programming and opportunities such as the senior games provide a much needed and healthy social opportunity for seniors.\u201d\n\nThe mayor noted that he had attended regular meetings of Fort Frances Power Corporation (FFPC), Rainy River District Municipal Association (RRDMA) and Rainy River District Social Services Administration Board (RRDSSAB) since his last update.\n\nPower Corp\n\nAt the FFPC meeting, the mayor said they were given a presentation on transitioning from a local distribution company to a distribution system operator, as well as a detailed financial analysis on the benefits of hiring a billing and finance analyst for the organization.\n\nTourism\n\nThe RRDMA general meeting, held on May 17, was attended by the mayor along with councillors Mike Behan and Wendy Brunetta and featured two guest speakers with talks aimed at life in the region.\n\n\u201cGord Knowles from NOTA spoke of district and regional tourism,\u201d Hallikas wrote.\n\n\u201cOf note is the fact the NOTA will provide financial assistance. This could be used to leverage our MAT money. John Van Der Broek, a ministry biologist, spoke on Elk and Agricultural damage. Councillor Brunetta asked him about the deer problem in Fort Frances and he indicated that the ministry deer expert is in Thunder Bay and would be happy to weigh in on the problem if asked.\u201d\n\nParamedics Week\n\nFinally, the mayor attended the monthly DSSAB meeting, where he said that among other matters, a presentation was given on understanding end of mortgage and changing regulations.\n\n\u201cThe Board reviewed policies on: Computer use, Email use, Internet Use, and Mobile Device use. The Board also reviewed a Naloxone Kit Policy. The Board received the results of its audit; a clean and unqualified report was given by the auditors. DSSAB will be celebrating Paramedics week from May 23 to May 25. The public is invited to visit the ambulance bases on various days for a barbecue. The Fort Frances Paramedic base will be hosting the public on May 26.\u201d\n\nKen Kellar\n\nKen Kellar is a reporter who was born and raised in Fort Frances.

Not yet, anyway.\n\nThe truth about my daughter needed to be heard.\u2013 Val Charlette\n\nThat\u2019s because the federal government hasn\u2019t set up a national task force to look into all unsolved cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, even though this was one of the most important calls for justice in the MMIWG inquiry\u2019s 2019 final report.\n\nAngela Lavallee says, \u201cThere\u2019s almost this story\u2026 of \u2018Don\u2019t tell me how to do my job.\u2019 That needs to stop.\u201d \u201cPolice, policing, and medical examiners need to listen.\u201d\n\nThe call for a national task force was one of 231 calls for justice in the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls\u2019 final report, which came out in June 2019. The calls, which the report calls \u201clegal imperatives,\u201d are instructions that governments and institutions were told to follow to stop violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people.\n\nThe inquiry report said that the national task force should \u201creview and, if necessary, reinvestigate each case of all unresolved files of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people from across Canada.\u201d\n\nA CBC analysis shows, however, that it is one of more than half of the calls for justice that have not been started as of July 2023. The federal government says that to make it happen, it would need the support of many governments, police departments, and Indigenous leaders.\u00a0\n\nSo far, that hasn\u2019t been the case.\n\nIn a written statement to the CBC, a federal government spokesperson said, \u201cThe Government of Canada remains steadfast in its commitment to working closely with all partners on this critical, ongoing priority to address the root causes of violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQI+ people, and to end the ongoing national crisis of MMIWG2S+.\u201d\n\nFamilies of people who have died live with unsolved cases that might never be looked into again.\n\nIn 2015, Zaylynn Emerald Rain, Angela Lavallee\u2019s granddaughter, died when she was only nine months old. Even though Lavallee thought that someone they knew had killed her, her worries were not taken seriously, she says.\n\n\u201cThere was never a full investigation. \u201cHer death was ruled to have no clear cause,\u201d Lavallee says. \u201cI was called \u2018paranoid\u2019 grandmother.\u201d\n\nNo one seems to care about us.\u2013 Destiny Paupanakis\n\nVal Charlette also has to deal with the pain of a case that hasn\u2019t been solved. She thinks she knows what needs to be done to fix it.\n\nTristan Jobb\u2019s body was found on a golf course in Creighton, Saskatchewan, in October 2022. The course was out of the way and a few kilometers from where Tristan was last seen. Her face was cut and bruised, and her hair was tangled and full of dirt.\u00a0\n\nThe coroner\u2019s office said there was nothing strange about her death. Charlette came to a different conclusion, though, when she took part in a traditional cultural ceremony.\n\n\u201cAt that ceremony, I was told that someone had given her a drug with a needle\u2026 They gave her too much medicine by accident, and they had to take her body somewhere. \u201cAnd I know it\u2019s not science,\u201d says Charlette.\n\nThe justice system won\u2019t accept her daughter\u2019s truth, which is what she called it.\n\n\u201cAccording to science, I have to see it to believe it. In our culture, it was important that my daughter\u2019s truth be heard.\u201d\n\nCharlette says that a national task force with Indigenous people on it would listen to that truth.\n\nCharlotte says, \u201cThey know how to look at a scene, they carry sacred bundles to be a part of it, and they can see things we can\u2019t really see.\u201d \u201cSo that the only thing local police would have to do is make sure the scene is safe.\u201d\n\nDestiny Paupanakis says straight out that Call for Justice 9.9 hasn\u2019t moved forward.\n\n\u201cNo one seems to care about us. There\u2019s no justice,\u201d she says.\n\nPaupanakis wonders if an Indigenous-led team of investigators would believe her suspicions that her sister Angel Blue Sky did not kill herself.\n\n\u201cLike she always said, \u2018I\u2019d never kill myself, so if anything ever happens to me, just know that I didn\u2019t kill myself,'\u201d Paupanakis says.\n\nShe says that a justice system run by Indigenous people could stop investigations that are based on racism.\n\n\u201cJustice would mean telling the truth and having our own police force,\u201d he said.\n\nAnyone affected by the details of these cases can get help. If you need help, you can call Medicine Bear Counselling, Support, and Elder Services at 204-594-6500, ext. 102 or 104, in Winnipeg, or 1-888-953-5264 outside of Winnipeg.\n\nThe Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Liaison Unit of Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak can also help.

Merrick would like to see the Winnipeg landfill where two women's remains have been found in less than a year permanently shut down. THE CANADIAN PRESS/John Woods\n\nWINNIPEG \u2014 The leader of a First Nations advocacy group wants to see the Winnipeg landfill where the remains of two Indigenous women were found permanently shut down.\n\n\"I think given the circumstance, that it should be. It's not an isolated issue,\" Grand Chief Cathy Merrick of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs said in a phone interview Wednesday.\n\n\"I know there are lots of (Indigenous women) that have been missing throughout time, and I'm pretty sure that some of those women are in the Brady landfill.\"\n\nThe Winnipeg homicide unit started an investigation after staff at the Brady Road landfill south of the city found the body of 33-year-old Linda Mary Beardy on Monday.\n\nThe cause and time of her death have not been released.\n\nThe landfill has been closed as police investigate. The city said contingency plans for garbage and recycling are in place.\n\nMerrick said the city should look at opening a new landfill that would include measures to help with police investigations when situations like this occur.\u00a0\n\n\"I know it's not going to happen today, but that's something that they need to look at as well.\"\n\nThe assembly has called for the incorporation of new technologies at landfills, including screening and scanning of trucks with serial numbers, dates and times that coincide with the dumping of loads. It said landfills must also track routes and timelines.\n\n\"It's shameful. We have to come out looking in landfills for our women,\" Merrick said.\u00a0\n\nGarbage collection vehicles are equipped with GPS devices that allow for the tracking of specific loads and where materials are being deposited within the landfill, the city said. Staff are also trained to report any suspicious materials to the police.\u00a0\n\nThe City of Winnipeg said in a statement Wednesday night that it is not considering the permanent closure of the Brady Road landfill. It said it is the only municipally-owned and operated landfill in the capital region. It also noted it is the largest in the area.\n\n\u00a0City Coun. Markus Chambers said the discoveries point to the \"upstream work\" the city needs to do to support Indigenous communities.\n\n\"They're ending up at landfills. They're not happening at landfills,\" Chambers said. \"We've got to be able to prevent them or find a way to mitigate against these occurrences happening where they're ending up in the landfill.\"\n\nChambers added there needs to be more support for women and girls who come to the city from Indigenous communities, including educating people about the challenges of living in an urban setting.\u00a0\n\nBeardy was a mother and a member of Lake St. Martin First Nation but lived in Winnipeg at the time of her death. Merrick was told no one had heard from the young mother for about a week before her remains were found.\u00a0\n\nPolice have said they do not believe her case is linked to the killing of Rebecca Contois, whose remains were found in the same landfill last year, or the killings of three other women.\n\nPolice have said they believe the remains of Morgan Harris and Marcedes Myran are in the privately run Prairie Green landfill north of Winnipeg, but their bodies have not been found.\n\nJeremy Skibicki has been charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Contois, Harris and Myran \u2014 all First Nations women, as well as an unidentified woman Indigenous leaders have named Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman. Police have also not located her remains.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau offered his condolences Wednesday to Beardy's family and the larger Indigenous community. He said the federal government needs to do more to end the epidemic of violence that Indigenous women and girls face.\n\nTrudeau said it's heartbreaking that discoveries like these continue to happen.\u00a0\n\n\"My heart goes out to the community in Winnipeg and to the families of the woman who was \u2026 left in this way,\" Trudeau said.\n\n\"We will continue to be there with the community as it grieves, but we will also continue to be there to put an end to this unconscionable violence.\"\n\nThe prime minister added his Liberal government has made significant strides in countering gender-based violence, but there's more it could be doing.\u00a0\n\nFederal NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said the discovery highlights the need to implement the 231 calls for justice from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\u00a0\n\n\"Women are dying, lives are being taken and we have to take it seriously,\" Singh said.\u00a0\n\nCrown-Indigenous Relations Minister Marc Miller has praised workers at the Brady landfill for their \"heightened vigilance\" in finding Beardy's remains.\u00a0\n\nMiller also said a study into the feasibility of searching the Prairie Green landfill for the remains of Harris and Myran should be completed in the coming weeks. The federal government put up $500,000 in February for the study.\n\nAn Indigenous-led committee headed by the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs said it is confident the study will \"deem these search and recovery efforts feasible.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 5, 2023.\n\n\u2014 With files from Steve Lambert in Winnipeg and Mickey Djuric in Ottawa\n\nBrittany Hobson, The Canadian Press\n\nGet your daily Coquitlam news briefing\nEmail\nSign Up\nHave a story idea?\nLetter to the editor\nReport a mistake\nMore National News\n\tSystem failing growing number of seniors who are homeless, need more support: report\n\t'Happy tears' of victim's sister after prison attack on serial killer Robert Pickton\n\tTrudeau making 'Team Canada' charm offensive in visit to Philadelphia\n\nCOMMUNITY POLL\nParticipate in our next community poll.\nWhat is your go-to mode of transportation around the Tri-Cities?\nview related story\n Bus\n SkyTrain\n Bicycle\n Personal vehicle\n Scooter\n Rollerblades\n Hoverboard\n I prefer to walk.\n Other (comment below)\n\nVote Results > Archives >\n\nTRENDING TODAY\n351\t\nPhotos: Colour and music fills Coquitlam's Town Centre Park \n\n348\t\nThis cookie sensation that's conquering North America is coming to Port Coquitlam\n\n186\t\nHe wanted to write about parenthood.

Signs are posted all around \u2013 some read \u201cwe are not garbage\u201d and \u201csearch the landfills.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an effort by Indigenous people to raise concerns and call on officials to search landfills for their missing and murdered relatives. Among the women they want found and brought home are Morgan Harris, 39, and Marcedes Myran, 26.\n\nPolice believe the women are victims of an alleged serial killer and that their remains could be in a landfill. Two camps have been set up to keep pressure on officials and draw awareness to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, Two Spirit, and Gender-Diverse People.\n\nThe issue of missing and murdered people is important to tribal communities on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border. It has been the topic of news reports, podcasts, documentaries \u2013 and protests.\n\nOn a recent morning, Shining Gold Star spoke about Camp Marcedes, named after Myran. He\u2019s been there since the camp was set up in July.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to honor the missing and murdered, especially the landfill, its focus is on: Search the landfill,\u201d Gold Star said.\n\nRed handprints are drawn on sidewalks and benches along walking paths near a river and park. A number of empty red dresses also are displayed, symbolizing the missing and murdered.\n\nAntonia Gonzales\n/\nNational Native News\n\nMore than 30 minutes away is the city-operated Brady landfill, where distress flags fly at Camp Morgan, named after Harris.\n\nRed dresses are positioned around another camp with tents, a wigwam and teepees. Some protestors say they\u2019ve been in the area since December. Others, like Ida Manuelof British Columbia, felt compelled to come this summer.\n\n\u201cMy heart, going out to the families affected and I just had to answer that call. \u2026 How could you be human any other way,\u201d Manuel said.\n\nRemains of Rebecca Contois, 24, were found at the Brady landfill last year.\n\nA blockade at the road leading up to the landfill had been set up, but was dismantled. Now, dumping continues.\n\nAntonia Gonzales\n/\nNational Native News\n\n\u201cFor us to stand and say we are not trash and still not be heard. You know, it really needs to be connected \u2013 Canada\u2019s lack of respect \u2026 with [what] colonialism set out to do to Indigenous [people],\u201d Manuel said.\n\nAnother landfill, Prairie Green, is privately operated outside Winnipeg. The Manitoba government cites costs, as well as health and safety concerns, for not conducting a search at the landfill for Harris and Myran.\n\nAdvocates say they\u2019re prepared to camp through the winter. They also hope new provincial leadership will be elected this fall to offer assistance.\n\nLast year, Jeremy Skibicki was charged for the murder of the three women and a fourth unidentified woman.\n\nTags\nNews Missing and Murdered Indigenous WomenIndigenousMWNB\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nThe Latest From Boise State Public Radio\nWildfire weather, fueled by climate change, is increasing across the Mountain West, study finds\n53 minutes ago\nA new poll says young Latino voters could be a force in the 2024 election\n1 hour ago\nSix Idaho dairy farms have the avian flu.

The $5.2 million commitment will prioritize the well-being of chronic missing people and provide a coordinated inter-agency response across Manitoba.\n\n\"The safety of Manitobans is our top priority, and this increased investment demonstrates our commitment to addressing the issue of missing people in our province,\" says Goertzen. \"By strengthening our police services and enhancing inter-agency collaboration, we aim to leverage all our collective strengths against the threat of violence and improve public safety in Manitoba.\"\n\nThe Manitoba Integrated Missing Persons Response was announced in March with an initial $2.1 million commitment from the Violent Crime Strategy. The $3.1 million in new funding will support the operational plan established by Winnipeg Police Service (WPS) and the RCMP, providing a consistent and streamlined reporting, tracking and investigation approach to missing people from rural communities, municipalities and First Nations across the province.\n\nThe Integrated Missing Persons Response aligns directly with several recommendations outlined in the final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. The need for better-supported, community-based first response and more responsive, transparent and accountable policing are central elements addressed by this initiative.\n\n\"The Manitoba First Nations Police Service embraces this opportunity to work together with the RCMP, WPS and other agencies on this most critical issue. Anytime there is a person missing, whose whereabouts are unknown, there is a concern for their safety and well-being,\" says Chief Doug Palson, Manitoba First Nations Police Service. \"Regardless of the reason for the disappearance, the trauma experienced by family and friends can be tremendous. The draft protocol for missing persons investigations represents a commitment to cooperation between police services to reduce jurisdictional barriers and promote timely and community-responsive approaches, keeping families involved, and treated with compassion and respect.\"\n\nThe Integrated Missing Persons Response unit will provide a consistent intake process for missing person reports across the province and prioritize investigations into suspicious missing persons cases.\n\nRecent statistics provided by the Government of Canada's Missing Persons Fast Fact Sheet highlight the urgency of this issue. In 2021 alone, there were 2,124 missing adults in Manitoba, with 37 per cent classified as runaways or chronic missing people. Manitoba had the second-highest number of missing adults per capita, with 152 reports per 100,000 people, trailing only British Columbia. Additionally, 5,390 missing children were reported in Manitoba in 2021, with 63 per cent of them being runaway girls. Manitoba also had the highest number of missing children per capita, with 375 reports per 100,000 people.\n\nThe minister notes the anticipated outcomes of this increased investment include a decreased number of missing people, timely and adequate investigations of suspicious missing person cases, an increased number of referrals for chronic missing youth/adults to well-being-centred supports and programs, and a decreased demand on police resources to respond to chronic missing person's reports.\n\nGoertzen says the Manitoba government remains committed to providing significant support to police services to collectively address missing people in Manitoba through targeted investments in supporting expanded police resources.\n\nChief Doug Palson (Manitoba First Nations Police Service),\u00a0Insp.

The party also criticized the Canadian high commissioner\u2019s recent interventions in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka and stated in the letter that it wondered whether High Commissioner Walsh intended to contest Sri Lanka\u2019s presidential election due next year.\n\nThis is a modal window.\n\nNo compatible source was found for this media.\n\u00a0 Comments - 12\n\nRuwan Friday, 28 July 2023 01:16 PM\n\nWell quite nornal and to be expected of the NPF a good for nothing bunch of guys.\n\nReply\n\nMartin Friday, 28 July 2023 01:28 PM\n\nWell, RW didn\u2019t fully solved the debt crisis yet. Country is just going on by not paying the interest on debt and so one day people will be back on street again when the creditors squeeze us for their capital or interest or for both.\n\nReply\n\nSri Lankan in Canada Friday, 28 July 2023 01:44 PM\n\nYou NPF, your letter would have gone into the Canadian dustbin.\n\nReply\n\nDiabolical Friday, 28 July 2023 02:13 PM\n\nWell said, genocide of aboriginals\n\nReply\n\nPunchi Friday, 28 July 2023 02:40 PM\n\nThe NPF view is a reflection of poor thinking. The Canadians have conceded there was some sort of inaction with reference to missing indigenous people but the Canadian government didn\u2019t orchestrate or participate in actioning the disappearance. There may have been neglect in applying resources to investigate. Whereas in our paradise all sections of the majoritarian people including government, security establishment and peoples participated in negative actions against our fellow citizens. Also it is immaterial the NPP perspective on this. The Canadians can do more harm to us in international forums etc than we can do to them.\n\nReply\n\nKumara Friday, 28 July 2023 02:45 PM\n\nBut Sri Lanka was not declared guilty or no guilty yet! So we need creditable international independent investigation to clear naming a country as Guilty. So allow and protest for it. No point in pointing a finger at others, clear your name first!\n\nReply\n\nFirst of all, how can you say this is your country? Friday, 28 July 2023 02:58 PM\n\nWe talk for our SELF. We don't care for world opinion.

Had NPF raised valiant points, then the embassy would have forwarded the letter to the appropriate Canadian government agency. They are accusing Canada of promoting separatism and questioning whether the high Commissioner intend to run in the Presidential elections? In my opinion, the letter would have been ripped prior to NPF left the Canadian H.C's gate. Also, readers still commenting negatively about Gary Anandasangaree. Obviously, not aware of his accomplishments and his service to his constituents. Just Google his name or check him in Linked-in to find out his credentials and awards. Cheers!\n\nReply\n\nJeanne Saturday, 29 July 2023 07:42 AM\n\nThe difference is: Canada acknowledged their wrongdoing and was declared guilty of genocide. And that was the end of that. And they have moved on and are making amends by changing their laws etc. Sri Lanka on the other hand are in a 40-year state of shameful denial and justification of their shocking atrocities. So, let's change NPF's call to: Canada has EVERY right here.\n\nReply\n\nAdd comment\nComments will be edited (grammar, spelling and slang) and authorized at the discretion of Daily Mirror online.
