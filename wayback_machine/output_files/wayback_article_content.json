Trudeau replied: \u201cThis matters. Indigenous lives matter. That you even have to say that is frustrating to me.\u201d\nCBC photo\nAiyanna and Trey weren\u2019t the least bit impressed mom had been featured on the CBC National News earlier this week.\n\nInstead, the youngsters were focused on the basics of a mom\u2019s job \u2014 getting breakfast ready and a diaper changed.\nSome day, however, Nikki Fraser\u2019s kids, ages 3 and 5, will know of the 10 minutes the Kamloops woman spent with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, asking questions Fraser hopes will play a role in making the world a safer place for children like hers \u2014 and, specifically, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 for the nation\u2019s daughters.\nFraser was one of 10 people chosen by the CBC to ask Trudeau a question. She chose the topic of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.\nHowever, the youth worker didn\u2019t know initially her question would be posed to the prime minister.\nFraser said she was approached by the CBC and asked to share her story and the reasons why she is an activist in the movement that would see the country confront the reality that more than 1,200 indigenous women have died or disappeared.\nAmong them were Fraser\u2019s aunt Dorothy Spence, who disappeared from Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside in 1995, and her cousin Samantha Paul, whose body was found in the White Lake area near Barnhartvale in 2014, almost a year after she disappeared.\nThe next step was an invitation to Ottawa, where Fraser learned she would take part in the CBC event.\nFilming took place on Jan. 28 and the 10 people taking part remained in the nation\u2019s capital until the live broadcast on Sunday that accompanied the CBC\u2019s Peter Mansbridge introducing the questions and answers \u2014 and the people behind them.\nFraser said she appreciated Trudeau\u2019s answer to her question: With respect to missing murdered indigenous women, what is your plan to stop this from happening?\nBut, she noted he replied like a politician, not providing a concrete response.\nTrudeau pointed to the national inquiry he has launched into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.\n\u201cThere\u2019s Lessons to learn and things to make that we do so we get healing for the families and the loved ones, so we get justice for the victims and, mostly, so we make that your daughter and no one else\u2019s daughter, sister, cousin gets to go through this in the future,\u201d Trudeau replied.\nFraser noted the RCMP has had a \u201chorrible track record\u201d dealing with the issue.\n\u201cWell, there are big changes to make right across the board,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cThe RCMP\u2019s part of it, but the culture of government and politics is a big part of it as well. This matters. Indigenous lives matter. That you even have to say that is frustrating to me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a start,\u201d Fraser said of Trudeau\u2019s response, adding she was most impressed when Trudeau said all indigenous life matters. In Fraser\u2019s mind, those few words carried a large message, one she had not expected to hear.\n\u201cAt the end of the live show, we were all there, shaking hands and mingling and I said to the prime minister \u2018You made history today, Mr. Prime Minister\u2019,\u201d when you said all indigenous life matters.\n\u201cAnd he said, \u2018No, you made history today\u2019.\u201d\nHeading home, Fraser said people recognized her in the airport and\u00a0 thanked her for sharing her story, some crying as they spoke with her.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I did it,\u201d Fraser said, \u201cto get the opportunity to put my aunty\u2019s story out there and put my cousin\u2019s story out there.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose them in the statistics.\u201d\nShe did it for Aiyana, as well, and for all the other young indigenous girls in Canada.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want her to grow up in a country where her life is less valued.\u201d\nFraser, a member of the B.C. Native Women\u2019s Association and the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, praised the recent ruling by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal that found the federal government discriminated against tens of thousands of First Nations children by providing less money for child welfare on reserves.\n\u201cIt was a long time overdue,\u201d she said of the legal battle that took nine years to go from the complaint by social worker Cindy Blackstock to the tribunal\u2019s ruling. \u201cIt was a huge victory.\u201d\nFraser is heading to Manitoba for meetings being held in advance of the planned national inquiry Trudeau announced during the federal election campaign.\nShe will continue sharing stories of her aunt and cousin and talking\u00a0 about her vision for the future of her daughter and son.\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting the conversation going,\u201d Fraser said. \u201cAnd now that we\u2019ve shared our truths, I want justice.\u201d\n\n\nfeatured\n2016-02-02\nDale Bass\n\n\ntweet \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTagged with: featured\n\nPrevious: A kind act at Save-On-Foods saved her more\nNext: Americans knock off visiting Blazers\n\n\n\nAlso in the News...\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBeckett murder trial: Court hears accused\u2019s statement to police after wife\u2019s death\nFebruary 3, 2016\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPerforming-arts advocate left a lasting legacy\nFebruary 3, 2016\n\n\n\n\n \n\nKGHM fires CEO, board members\nFebruary 3, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t7 comments\t\t\t\n \n\n\nScore: 0\n\n\nT'KemlupsTerritory \tFebruary 3, 2016 at 6:11 am\n\n\n\nWell it\u2019s a darn sight better than #mmiw \u201cjust not on our radar\u201d\nWhat a shameful embarrassment the former \u201cprime minister\u201d was for our country.\nEqually embarrassing is the fact that the people of T\u2019Kemluups voted in the conservatives locally.

No woman should go missing and end up murdered, no woman should tossed away like garbage. There is a lot of work to be done here, I hope this government comes up with something that will help everyone. I am not sure if they can prevent any woman from leaving home and ending up dead, but it is a fact that an inquiry needs to be done in depth.\nvoted\n 2\n1\n\nLog in to Reply \n\n\n\n\n\nScore: -1\n\n\nT'KemlupsTerritory \tFebruary 3, 2016 at 2:01 pm\n\n\n\nThe \u201chomes\u201d these women came from were in Canada.

When children are brought up in homes where drugs and alcohol and abuse is prevalent, they miss out on proper childhoods. it does not matter if they are First Nations or not, it is a fact. What happens in a child\u2019s life sets the scene for their later years. Poverty, neglect etc. all play a part. Please remember that it is not only indigenous women who go missing and who are murdered, we need an inquiry into every single missing woman in Canada, our lives matter. I realize that the inquiry is only for indigenous people, but  I believe that every family who is missing a loved one deserves equal time.\n\n 0\n0\n\nLog in to Reply \n\n\n\n\n\nScore: 0\n\n\nSmartask \tFebruary 3, 2016 at 5:54 pm\n\n\n\nEarly in this century, bureaucrats in the Department of Education in Victoria did not think that native children were capable of higher learning, therefore; they moved First Nation education from the initial attempts at integration to assimilation through Residential Schools. This policy, led to culture assassination, which continued in the province well into the twentieth century. \u201cMany of the problems endemic to Aboriginal communities , such as family violence, alcoholism, suicide, and poverty, have their roots in assimilation and colonialism, in which Residential Schools played a major role.\u201d Jan Hare, Jan Hare, \u201cAboriginal Families and Aboriginal Education\nEuropeans saw their education policy of First Nation children as a civilizing process, and in 1920 the Indian Act was amended making school attendance mandatory for First Nation children. With government approval and financial help from Ottawa, the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian and Methodist churches used Residential Schools as an opportunity to acquire new converts. Enrollment in Residential Schools expanded \u201cfrom 878 children in 1918-1919 to 17,173 in 1932\u201d. Conformity, control and separation of children from their families by placing them in Residential Schools was an attempt by Europeans to make hunter gatherer and fisherman family units into  farmers. Since most people learn to parent from their parents and how they were brought up, this policy of segregation deprived many the First Nations children of parenting skill.\nI will not prejudge First Nation children since there are many who are well adjusted loved and nurtured, many are great parents and some in leadership roles. There are many who are like this man that I personally know. \nMr. M. has an interesting history full of stories and events that took place throughout the course of his life. Mr. M was born in 1964 to a young mother whose parents were brought up in a residential school. Because his mother was very young, Mr. M lived with his grandparents, and this is where most of this personal history began. At the young age of three Mr. M. was taken away from his grandparents by what he called \u201cwelfare sweeps\u201d. Welfare sweeps took place into the mid 1970\u2019s when government officials believed that children were neglected in the home they were taken away and placed in foster care. A First Nations friend remembers vividly playing outside her house and seeing a dark car approach her home. The people in the car were government officials. They offered her candy and lured her into the vehicle. She was scooped from her front yard and taken away.\nMr. M.\u2019s family, conditioned by residential schools, did not develop parenting skills and Mr. M did not have a positive role model to follow. As a child of residential school parents, his mother did not know how to love or hug him and his fifteen brothers and sisters. He was raised in Blue River in foster care until the age of 13. He quit school in grade 8 and eventually ended up in Whitehorse. Mr. M moved from foster home to foster home where mental, verbal, sexual and physical abuse that took place. Mr. M eventually did go back to school thanks to the contact he made with teachers in the public and native schools. He now works helping native youth who were like him bounced from one house to the next. \nThe young woman who spoke with the PM had very bad teeth. You need to ask the band and the dental community  why her health  was compromised. The same reason that her troubled life was compromised.\n\n 0\n0\n\nLog in to Reply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScore: 0\n\n\nken sailer \tFebruary 3, 2016 at 4:31 pm\n\n\n\nabsolutely correct Blondie, if their own people spent a little more time helping themselves then a lot of this would never  have  happened.

The trafficking of human beings is an extremely lucrative crime with annual profits estimated at 150 billion USD.1 In Canada, the average annual profits from a single victim of sex trafficking is $280,000. 2 Tragically, this insidious industry continues to operate with relative impunity because of the low risk factors and high financial returns involved. The International Labor Organization estimates that globally there are 4.8 million people trapped in forced sexual exploitation.\n3Pope Francis has denounced the trafficking of human beings as \u201can open wound on the body of contemporary society, a scourge upon the body of Christ.\u201d4\nWHAT IS HUMAN TRAFFICKING?2. In 2003, the Canadian government adopted and ratified the Palermo Protocol,5 which describes three components in the trafficking of human beings:\n\n3. Statistics Canada reports that between 2009 and 2018, a total of 1708 police-reported incidents of human trafficking were reported, with 63% involving prostitution offences. The number and rate of human trafficking incidents have steadily increased since 2010.6 Due to the clandestine nature of the crime and the reluctance of witnesses and victims to come forward to the police, the real numbers are much higher than those reported.\n4. Human trafficking does not require that a victim cross a national border. It happens in Canada, perhaps even in your neighbourhood. In fact, most trafficking in Canada is domestic; the persons being trafficked are primarily Canadians.7\n5. Although there are various types of human trafficking, this pastoral message focuses onthe trafficking of human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation (prostitution). It doesso from the perspective of the Social Teaching of the Catholic Church, as well as our currentCanadian law, the Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act (PCEPA). We willexplain why prostitution cannot be considered a form of \u201cwork\u201d or simply a personal choice,and will then respond to a series of questions:\u2022 Who are the buyers?\u2022 Who are the victims?\u2022 What does legalization/decriminalization mean?\u2022 What do survivors need to exit prostitution?\u2022 What is our responsibility as Catholics following the example of Jesus Christ who modeled compassion for all, especially the most marginalized?\nSurvivor Voices\u201cTo the people of Canada:For nine long, horrible years, I was trafficked in the sex industry. I was no more than \u2018girl number four\u2019, valued only for my outward appearance and ability to please customers. I regularly saw 12-14 men per night. I was punched, slapped, bitten and worse, all in the name of my so called \u2018job\u2019. My customers wanted the porn-star experience, things that they wouldn\u2019t do with someone they loved or respected. My story is not an uncommon one\u2026I can only say that to judge me you truly need to have lived some of my experiences or have some of my vulnerabilities. But what you do need to know is that this abuse is occurring right in your community, and you\u2019re likely not even aware.\u201d8 \u2014 Casandra Diamond, Survivor\nTHE SOCIAL TEACHING OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH\n6. Catholic Social Teaching (CST) includes several foundational principles. The act of buying sexual services violates every one of them, but particularly the following:\n\nTHE LIFE AND DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON\n\nAll humans are created by God and instilled with intrinsic value and worth. They are created by Love and for love. \u201cBuying sexual services from a prostituted person has nothing to do with love; instead, it is a serious offence against human dignity.\u201d9 People are not to be used as a means to an end,10 as occurs in sex trafficking. Prostitution denies and effaces the person\u2019s dignity and does not respect their integrity.\nGiven the inalienable dignity and worth of every human person, it is morally unacceptable that anyone should purchase the body of another person for their own sexual gratification.\n\n THE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE HUMAN PERSON\n\nGiven the fundamental right to life of every person created in God\u2019s image, it follows that the basic requirements for life such as food, clothing, shelter, etc., are also rights. In the hands of traffickers, however, prostituted persons are frequently denied these basic needs. Their freedom is restricted, and their safety is often threatened to ensure compliance.\n\nTHE DIGNITY OF WORK AND THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS\n\nEvery person is entitled to legitimate work. However, prostitution is not \u201cwork\u201d since it respects neither the dignity of the victim nor that of the buyer. No workplace would permit such physical and psychological harm done to an employee. No respectable employer would permit workers to be assaulted and threatened under such inhumane and unacceptable conditions. Treating sex as \u201cwork\u201d masks the physical, psychological and sexual violence inflicted on the prostituted person.11 Prostitution involves selling something that by its nature cannot be bought or sold and is therefore inherently exploitative.\n\nTHE OPTION FOR THE POOR AND VULNERABLE\n\nStatistics indicate that the most marginalized are often pulled into selling sexual services because of poverty, limited options, and gender and educational inequality.\nWHO ARE THE BUYERS?\n\nBuying sex is the most common reason for trafficking human persons. In such transactions, one person provides a tangible item or good (e.g., drugs, money) in exchange for sexual services from another person. The buyer is both directly (by violating the person\u2019s body) and indirectly (by financially supporting the system holding that person in bondage) responsible for the harm done to the prostituted person.\n\n\nBuyers are most often men and come from every race, age group, and profession. They usually are from a higher economic class and possess higher than average educational levels. Many use pornography, which influences them to view persons as objects. Most men purchase sex in off-street venues such as brothels, escort agencies and massage parlors.12\n\nA Polaris report found that in the United States these illicit \u201cmassage parlors\u201d earn around $2.5 billion annually, with the proceeds supporting organized criminal networks.13\nWHO ARE THE VICTIMS?\n\nThe most common factors involved with entry into prostitution include being poor, being female, having experienced violence and/or neglect, and having a low level of education.14\n\nAccording to the Canadian Federal Government\u2019s National Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking 2019-2024, \u201cIndividuals at greatest risk of victimization in Canada generally include women and girls and members of vulnerable or marginalized groups such as: Indigenous women and girls, migrants and new immigrants; LGBTQ2 persons; persons living with disabilities; children in the child welfare system; at risk youth and those who are socially or economically disadvantaged.\u201d15\n\nThe above Strategy also notes that \u201ctestimony from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous women and girls has highlighted that human trafficking is strongly linked to disproportionately high rates of violence against Indigenous women and girls and that the extent of human trafficking and victimization of Indigenous women is grossly under-reported.\u201d16\n\n\nPROSTITUED PERSONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:\n\nIndigenous girls fleeing violence and neglect\nAsian women in brothels (massage parlors, nail salons) with no identification papers and limited English\nImmigrants who have minimal social supports and experience difficulty adapting to a new country\nGirls living in group homes, homeless shelters, foster care and those lured through the internet, from malls and from school grounds\n\n\nThe buyers, pimps and traffickers need to be held accountable for the harm they cause to society\u2019s voiceless and most vulnerable. The trauma inflicted by abusive relationships is extremely destructive. Psychological scars and bruises affect the entire life of the victim. The prostituted person is treated as a commodity or object, thus damaging their sense of worth with internalized shame and guilt. Most suffer from various difficulties, including PTSD, severe depression, damage to their reproductive system, sexually transmitted diseases, and physical harm from beatings and assaults.\n\nHOW CAN PROSTITUTION BE \"WORK\"?\n\nSome people today want to treat prostitution as \u201cwork.\u201d However, many of its victims have no meaningful choice in it.18 Prostitution is not consensual sexual activity. It relies on the lie that one can be entitled to the body of another person and it fosters the idea that human beings\u2014usually, but not always, women\u2014are sexual commodities whose consent can be purchased. The prostituted person complies with the buyer\u2019s demand not for sexual gratification but because they need the money. Compliance is not consent.\n\nAs Shelagh Day, founding president of the Women\u2019s Legal Education and Action Fund, makes clear:\n\u201cThe bargain inherent in prostitution is that women have unwanted sex with men they do not know, and feign enjoyment, in exchange for money. Calling this sex between consenting adults ignores the fundamental inequality in the sexual and human transaction for the woman and the man.\u201d19\u00a0\n\nIn the Criminal Code of Canada,20 it is a criminal offence to engage in sexual activity without consent. There is, then, already an obvious conflict between prostitution as \u201cwork\u201d and the laws of sexual assault. The Supreme Court of Canada describes rape as a serious violation of bodily integrity.21 Yet those protections in the Criminal Code would become meaningless if compelled sexual activity were to be considered \u201cwork.\u201d This is even more so the case when the prostituted person is considered to be an \u201cemployee.\u201d Where the primary obligation of the employee to the employer is to provide sex to a third party, the act of prostitution is in direct conflict with Canadian laws on sexual assault.\nProstitution is also an inherently discriminatory practice since it primarily consists of men seeking to buy sex from women. Men tend to buy sexual services based on physical attributes with a high preference for young women and girls.\nIt is unlawful to require a person to engage in sex as a condition of their employment. Human rights laws uphold the right of workers to be free from sexual harassment.22 This protection applies to a server in a restaurant, a domestic worker, a babysitter or any other form of employment. Prostitution is, as well, a form of sexual harassment.\nIn summary, the very nature of prostitution as a practice of exploitation precludes it from ever becoming lawful \u201cwork.\u201d And from the point of view of Catholic Social Teaching, any sexual act that is not a free gift of self falls short of God\u2019s plan for the flourishing of the human person.\n\nSurvivor Voices\u201cI was at the mercy of the clients who would take advantage of my lack of personal boundaries. I would be left with bruises all over my body from the rough sex; men always wanted to imitate hardcore porn, acting out the sexual violence they were feeding on. The drunker they were, the angrier they would get until they were in hateful rages. Those were the times my vagina would bleed from the trauma. I had no one to tell or to help me as we (the girls) were experiencing the same thing.\u201d 23 \u00a0\u2013Jade\nWHY DECRIMINALIZATION/LEGALIZATION ISN'T THE ANSWER\n\nNew Zealand considers prostitution as \u201cwork\u201d. In 2003, it passed the Prostitution Reform Act, decriminalizing sex buyers, brothels and the prostitution of people over the age of 18. Although it is illegal for minors to be involved in prostitution, there are still \u201cgirls as young as 13 and 14 on the streets selling their bodies.\u201d24\nWhen prostitution is a \u201cbusiness,\u201d brothel owners have total control over their \u201cemployees\u201d and the prostituted women have no access to legal protection. Police in New Zealand note that there is \u201cno systematic intelligence gathering,\u201d25 making it more difficult to uncover exploitation. Abuse, harassment and violence are common, and they are rarely reported to authorities.26\nGermany is another country with legalized prostitution. Since legalization, demand has grown, with 1.2 million men buying sex every day from 400,000 women and girls.27 This demand is being filled by trafficked women from the poorest regions of Europe\u2014particularly Romania and Bulgaria\u2014as well as China, Nigeria and other parts of Africa.28 The red-light district in various cities has become a highly criminal environment in the hands of organized crime.\n\nLegalization/decriminalization is a failed experiment. It only serves to increase demand by promoting and normalizing the social acceptance of sexual exploitation.\nTHE LEGAL MODEL ADOPTED IN CANADA\n\nIn 2014, the Parliament of Canada passed The Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act (PCEPA,) which decriminalizes all those who are prostituted, provides funding for support services to help them exit and makes buying sex from anyone a criminal offence. The Act criminalizes those who purchase sex, while decriminalizing those who sell, holding the buyers accountable for their criminal behaviour. This law is a positive step forward and an example to other countries of how both to protect the victims and to hold the buyers accountable. It puts the focus on the demand for paid sex, which is the underlying cause of trafficking.\nCanada\u2019s legislation recognizes that prostitution is by its nature exploitative and violent, that it objectifies the human body by commodifying sexual activity, and that it has a disproportionately negative effect on women and children.29 This law, sometimes referred to as the Nordic or Equality model, is the way forward. Yet, as a global leader in this area, Canada ought to ensure a more consistent enforcement of the law everywhere in our country. Collaboration between law enforcement and the judicial system in Canada is essential. In some jurisdictions, law enforcement agencies are not regularly prioritizing enforcement due to outdated policy and limited resources.\n\nProstitution is violent and exploitative. Stopping the demand for buying sex is the only way to prevent more crimes and the harm caused to the victims of prostitution.\nWHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT FOR THE PROSTITUDED PERSON TO LEAVE?\n\nExiting prostitution is a complex process that most often takes numerous attempts and several years to achieve. Some women might never get out of prostitution. Research by Melissa Farley revealed that of 854 prostituted persons from 9 countries, including Canada, 89% of the women wanted to escape prostitution but were forced to remain because they had no other option for survival.30 Only a small percentage are fortunate enough to be able to exit.\nThe length of involvement in prostitution as well as severity of the harm suffered determines the possibility of successful exiting. Some catalysts include becoming pregnant or a sudden illness, involvement in the criminal justice system, experiencing a particularly violent event, or finding a new stable relationship.\nExiting is difficult and often very dangerous. For many, the way into prostitution is the way out. For example, if the entry point into prostitution was to obtain money for one\u2019s drug addiction, then the first step to recovery will be involvement in a drug treatment program.\nMany barriers to exiting need to be addressed in the healing process. Some obstacles include lack of safe housing, poor employment histories, physical and mental health issues, low educational levels, financial instability, and age of entry. There is a correlation between the age of entry and the number of barriers experienced in attempting to exit. Those who enter prostitution as children encounter a greater number of barriers than those who entered as adults.31\n\nA key component in any process of exiting is returning the power for decision making back to the survivors, so that they can recover their self-determination.\n\nAs Pope Francis states, it is necessary \u201cto provide victims with welcome, human warmth and the possibility of building a new life.\u201d32 \u201cThe reintegration of human trafficking victims in society is no simple matter given the traumas they have suffered.\u201d33 Healing from the trauma, stigma and social isolation begins with the assistance of professionals trained in dealing with physical, psychological and spiritual suffering. Other basic needs such as housing, food, employment, education, health care, and social supports must also be provided by service agencies specifically designed to help trafficked women and girls.\n\u201cThe Church is committed to raising awareness of the growing need to support victims of these crimes by accompanying them on a path of reintegration into society and the recovery of their human dignity. The Church is grateful for every effort made to bring the balm of God\u2019s mercy to the suffering, for this also represents an essential step in the healing and renewal of society as a whole.\u201d34\n\nSurvivor Voices\u201cI was at the mercy of the clients who would take advantage of my lack of personal boundaries. I would be left with bruises all over my body from the rough sex; men always wanted to imitate hardcore porn, acting out the sexual violence they were feeding on.

I had no one to tell or to help me as we (the girls) were experiencing the same thing.\u201d 23 \u00a0\u2013Jade\nWHY DO WE NEED TO CARE?\n28. Catholics are called to follow the example of Jesus Christ who showed compassion to all, especially those suffering, the marginalized, those on the edges of society and those who conceal their needs through shame.29. In his message for the 2015 World Day of Peace, Pope Francis stated, \u201cwe are facing a global phenomenon that exceeds the competence of any one community or country, and therefore we need a mobilization comparable in size to that of the phenomenon itself.\u201d He calls us as Catholics \u201cto open our eyes, to the misery of those who are completely deprived of their dignity and their freedom and to hear their cry for help.\u201d36 Let\u2019s help them stop by ensuring that our law is enforced consistently across Canada. Buying sex in Canada is and should remain a crime. It is only by stopping the buying that this injustice will end. We therefore call upon governments at all levels, as well as law enforcement bodies, to ensure that the law is upheld in order to halt the continued violations of human dignity in our country.\n\n MOST IMPORTANTLY, LET US PRAY TO END SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING.\n\nAlmighty and merciful Father, help us to see the face of your Son in all those suffering from sexual exploitation and human trafficking in our world today. May your Holy Spirit strengthen the broken hearted and fill them with your love while changing the hearts of the exploiters.Grant us the courage to respond in solidarity with those who suffer and the wisdom to advocate for justice. Guide our civil leaders to work for the common good and to protect the vulnerable.We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.Mary, Mother of all the living, we implore your intercession for graces of healing for those who are exploited and conversion for the perpetrators, that all may live the abundant life of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\u00a0\nCANADA NOW HAS A CANADIAN HUMAN TRAFFICKING HOTLINE\nIf you suspect someone is being sexually trafficked or exploited, please call the 24/7 Canadian Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-833-900-1010 or visit www.canadianhumantraffickinghotline.ca\nLEARN TO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKINGVisit www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/human-trafficking/recognizing-human-trafficking-victims\n\u00a0\nENDNOTES \n1OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe), Office of the Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, \u201cFollowing the Money: Compendium of Resources and Step-by-Step Guide to Financial Investigations Related to Trafficking in Human Beings.\u201d (October 2019), p. 12. \n2 https://joysmithfoundation.com/p/human-trafficking/ \n3 International Labour Office and Walk Free Foundation, Global Estimates of Modern Slavery: Forced Labour and Forced Marriage.

EDMONTON\u2014A case that shocked the country with grisly details of an Indigenous woman found mutilated in an Edmonton motel is headed to the highest court in Canada on Thursday.Protesters hold signs in support of Cindy Gladue outside Edmonton's city hall on April 2, 2015.\u00a0\u00a0(Topher Seguin / The Canadian Press)Protesters show their support for Cindy Gladue during a rally in Edmonton on April 2, 2015.\u00a0\u00a0(Topher Seguin / The Canadian Press)Murial Stanley Venne is a long time Indigenous rights advocate, will be in Ottawa Thursday when the Cindy Gladue case heads to the Supreme Court of Canada.\u00a0\u00a0(StarMetro File)Cindy Gladue was found dead in an Edmonton hotel room in 2011.\u00a0\u00a0(StarMetro file)Cindy Gladue was found dead at the Yellowhead Inn after bleeding out in a bathtub from an 11-centimetre wound to her vaginal wall in 2011. Her accused killer, Bradley Barton, said the wound was inflicted from \u201cconsensual rough sex.\u201d He was found not guilty in a stunning acquittal. The Alberta Court of Appeal ordered a retrial in 2015, a decision Barton is now appealing.Indigenous women, activists and community members from across the country will be watching the hearing closely.Article Continued BelowMuriel Stanley Venne, president and founder of the Institute for the Advancement of Aboriginal Women, is in Ottawa to speak as an intervener at the Supreme Court of Canada hearing. She says the hearing has \u201chuge implications\u201d for the justice system, for Indigenous Peoples and for women in Canada.\u201cWe\u2019ve been struggling for decades to get attention paid to the death of our women,\u201d she said. \u201cIn this case, there\u2019s all the elements of prejudice and discrimination and a cavalier way of dealing with things, with no thought given to the feelings of the community. All of that is in this case and it\u2019s brought out in clear form.\u201d\u201cShe was utterly dehumanized both in the treatment she received from Barton and in the treatment she received from the criminal justice system, the violence the criminal justice system enacted upon her,\u201d said Julie Kaye, adviser for the Institute for the Advancement of Aboriginal Women.Barton, an Ontario trucker who made his living moving furniture across Canada, was first charged with first-degree murder in connection to Gladue\u2019s death on June 23, 2011. He stands six feet one inch tall and weighed 220 pounds.Gladue, 36, a petite woman at five foot five, weighing half as much as Barton, was found dead in a blood-smeared bathtub in Barton\u2019s hotel room one day earlier. Court heard Gladue had a potentially incapacitating level of alcohol in her system.In a rare move, a judge allowed the Crown to bring Gladue\u2019s preserved pelvic tissue into the courtroom as evidence, causing national outrage.At trial, Barton admitted to causing Gladue\u2019s death but argued it was an accident resulting from consensual sex when he thrust his fist into her vagina.Article Continued BelowThe Crown suggested a sharp object may have caused the cut.In either case, Crown prosecutors suggested Barton would still be guilty of manslaughter because he caused Gladue\u2019s death in the course of a sexual assault.However, a jury found Barton not guilty of first-degree murder and acquitted him of manslaughter.A new trial was ordered after Alberta\u2019s Court of Appeal agreed that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury and allowed evidence to be heard about Gladue\u2019s sexual history that opened the door for racist and sexist myths and stereotypes that could have clouded the judgment of the jurors.\u201cThis case has revealed the inescapable need in sexual offences to properly warn jurors to disregard unfair assumptions and to ensure that jury instructions adequately and accurately reflect the current law in Canada,\u201d wrote Chief Justice Catherine Fraser, Justice Jack Watson and Justice Sheila Martin in a decision giving reasons for their call for Barton\u2019s retrial.\u201cThe courts cannot permit this to go on,\u201d the decision concluded. \u201cWe must correct this. And we will.\u201dDuring her trial, Gladue was referred to as a \u201cprostitute\u201d 25 times and as a \u201cnative\u201d 26 times.\u201cRather than referring to her by name, she was referred to as \u2018native girl,\u2019 \u2018native woman,\u2019 as a \u2018prostitute.\u2019 These are very dehumanizing ways to refer to somebody, a person,\u201d said Kaye.To protect women in court proceedings from two stereotypes called the \u201ctwin myths\u201d \u2014 the misconceptions that a victim of sexual assault who consented to sexual activity in the past is likely to have consented to the sexual activity at issue, and that a woman is less worthy of being believed because of her past sexual history \u2014 Section 276 of the Criminal Code outlines that allegations about a person\u2019s sexual past are largely inadmissible in court and otherwise have to be preapproved by a judge out of earshot of the jury.Alberta\u2019s Court of Appeal found this did not happen in Gladue\u2019s case, as all sides repeatedly referred to Gladue as a prostitute said to have agreed to having sex with Barton for $60 and the judge made no effort to explain to the jury that her sexual past should have no bearing on her likelihood of consenting to the sexual acts that killed her.\u201cWe do have legal principles to suggest any sexual activity has to involve consent specifically to the degree of force that\u2019s used within the grounds of that activity,\u201d said Kaye, adding they are looking to the Supreme Court of Canada to ensure those legal standards are upheld.The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments on multiple procedural issues as they decide whether Barton will face a new trial, but some hope this case will see the top court decide whether a person can consent to sexual activity when there is an objective likelihood of serious harm.Alberta\u2019s Court of Appeal brought up case law out of Ontario looking at incidents in which a person died during a consensual fist fight. It was determined consent couldn\u2019t be given for acts in which that kind of harm was intended and caused, but there was little legal direction as to how issues of consent may apply to cases of sexual assault where harm or death is caused.In 1998, Venne received an Alberta Human Rights Award at Edmonton City Hall where she made a point to utter the names of 110 Indigenous women who were murdered without a single person charged. She remembers speaking with a newspaper columnist who covered the awards ceremony and asked how many phone calls they had received about the missing and murdered women.No one called. As Venne sees it, no one cared.Now 20 years later, she says not much has changed.\u201cIn many cases it\u2019s changed for the worse. It hasn\u2019t gotten better. But as I say that \u2026 we always take the attitude that there has to be some good out of even the worst situation,\u201d Venne said from Ottawa.Venne, who has been a human-rights activist for some 40 years, called the Cindy Gladue case a \u201cpinnacle\u201d in her quest for justice.Especially in light of a renewed focus on missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada and the global #MeToo movement, Venne believes the hearing will be precedent setting and a test of how the justice system treats Indigenous women.\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for Canada and the provinces, and every citizen and every woman in this country, to realize that if the Bradley Barton acquittal stands, they are in jeopardy,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an opportunity that was never before given to us, as a country, as the citizens of Canada, to do the right thing.\u201d Report an errorJournalistic Standards About UsRead more about: Edmonton, AlbertaTOP STORIES, DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX.NEW NEWSLETTERHEADLINESSIGN UPMore from The Star & PartnersLOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Her mother was found dead along Highway 16 near Prince Rupert in 1978 at the age of 31. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck\n\n\n\n\nSMITHERS, B.C. \u2014 Mary Jane Hill wasn't there to witness the birth of her grandchildren or to see them graduate from high school. She won't be there when her daughter needs her most, when she's in pain,\u00a0or on her wedding day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the losses Vicki Hill says she's suffered\u00a0because of\u00a0the death of her mother,\u00a0whose naked body was found along British Columbia's Highway of Tears in 1978. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"I never knew her, but to me, in my eyes, she gave me life,\" Hill told the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women on Tuesday. \"Now I have to live without her.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hill was\u00a0the first\u00a0family member\u00a0to testify\u00a0at an inquiry\u00a0hearing in Smithers, B.C.,\u00a0on Tuesday. She spoke softly and slowly, and her 15-year-old daughter, Zoey Hill-Harris, comforted her as tears rolled down her face. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n She said she was only six months old when her mother died and has no memories of her. The murder was never solved and she has struggled to get information and documents from police, she said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hill\u00a0read from a\u00a0coroner's inquest report\u00a0that concluded\u00a0her 31-year-old mother\u00a0died of bronchitis and pneumonia as a result of manslaughter. There was semen on\u00a0her body and her clothes were discovered\u00a0in an alley in\u00a0Prince Rupert,\u00a033 kilometres from where she was found dead,\u00a0she said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dozens of women have died or gone missing along the stretch of Highway 16 between Prince Rupert and Prince George, which has become known as the Highway of Tears. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"I'm not only speaking for my mom, I'm speaking for the rest of the families. I feel their pain, I feel their hurt. I can see it. I'm not afraid,\" she said. \"Things have got to change, no matter what.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Hill called on the commissioners to\u00a0listen to families and bring them justice, adding\u00a0she wants\u00a0to see improved cellphone service and transportation along the Highway of Tears. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n There is no cell service between Prince Rupert and Terrace, or in nearby Moricetown, she said, and she's never seen phone booths or emergency telephones, either. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n A British Columbia inquiry into missing and murdered women recommended bus service along the route, but it took years for the service to arrive, and some\u00a0buses\u00a0have to be caught in the middle of the night, she said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Vivian Tom, chief of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation in Burns Lake, also spoke Tuesday. Her powerful testimony about her 21-year-old daughter Destiny Tom brought several observers to tears. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Tom\u00a0recalled forgiving and hugging her daughter's\u00a0common-law partner and killer, Garrett George, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to just over eight years\u00a0in prison last November. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n She\u00a0also described a vision she had in church soon after her daughter's death. She\u00a0saw her daughter's body, and she\u00a0held her and rocked her in her arms, she said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"I said, 'Destiny, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry for what happened to you!

This figure only applies to cases that have been solved. An RCMP report released last May citing at least 1,181 indigenous women and girls were murdered or went missing between 1980 and 2012 did not include this information. \nNational Chief Bellegarde is sending a letter to the RCMP formally requesting that this information be shared with First Nations. \n\"That the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs is withholding important information and, worse, is using it against First Nations defies logic and the department's fiduciary duty,\" said National Chief Bellegarde. \"Blaming the victim is no longer an option. The federal government must recognize the root causes of poverty and work with us to address the poor conditions and lack of supports that our people endure every day, including action to support men's healing programs. Minister Valcourt committed just over a month ago at the National Roundtable on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, to work with us on coordinated action to prevent and address violence. He cannot in good faith continue withholding information.\" \nThe National Roundtable on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls was held February 27, 2015 with commitments by all jurisdictions on the development of a national prevention and awareness campaign, a National Justice Forum to be hosted in Manitoba and for the group to meet again next year to discuss progress. First Nations continue to call for a National Public Inquiry as a tool to identify and address root causes, including the impacts of colonialism on First Nations. \nFor more information on work toward an action plan to end violence and support for a National Public Inquiry please visit: http://www.afn.ca/index.php/en/policy-areas/i-pledge.-end-violence.\nThe Assembly of First Nations is the national organization representing First Nations citizens in Canada.

Families of lost women face an uphill battle to find their loved ones.On June 21, 2022, human remains were found at the Brady landfill in Winnipeg. Protesters have been blocking access to the waste management facility and have called on all levels of government to search for the remains of missing women and girls.On June 3, 2021, the National Action Plan, 2021 National Action Plan: Ending Violence Against Indigenous Women, Girls, And 2SLGBTQQIA+ People was released. It is in response to the June 2019 release of Reclaiming Power and Place: The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. It contains 231 Calls for Justice, calling on various organizations, governments, civil society actors, and individuals to take action to end the causes of violence against Indigenous women and girls.\u201cThe violence the National Inquiry heard about amounts to a race-based genocide of Indigenous Peoples, including First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis, which especially targets women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people. This genocide has been empowered by colonial structures, evidenced notably by the Indian Act, the Sixties Scoop, residential schools, and breaches of human and Indigenous rights, leading directly to the current increased rates of violence, death, and suicide in Indigenous populations,\u201d states the National Action Plan.In response to the national inquiry's final report, and to supplement the 29 M\u00e9tis-specific Calls for Justice, Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak released its own report on June 29, 2019 titled M\u00e9tis Perspectives of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and LGBTQ2S+ People, which includes 62 Calls for Change or Miskotah\u00e2 (pronounced \"Mis-KO-ta-ha\")\u201cThe process of a national plan begins with recognizing the truth. For non-Indigenous Canadians, this means rethinking commonly held stereotypes, and confronting racism in every context,\u201d according to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Women and Girls.Links to federal government information:\u2022 The 2021 National Action Plan\u2022 The federal pathway\u2022 The federal pathway annual progress report\u2022 Work we did before the release of the National Action Plan\u2022 Crisis Support ResourcesWHAT CAN YOU DO?1.

Canadian police believe the remains of 2 indigenous women who were victims of a serial killer are likely in a landfill.                    \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                 By Elizabeth Wolfe and Paradise Afshar, CNN (CNN) -- Authorities in Canada believe the remains of two indigenous women who died at the hands of an alleged serial killer are likely in a landfill, but police have decided not to conduct a search at the site, citing hazards and ground conditions.The victims -- Morgan Beatrice Harris, 39, and Marcedes Myran, 26 -- are two of four indigenous women who police believe were killed by the same man in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The suspect, Jeremy Anthony Michael Skibicki, 35, has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder in the women's deaths, according to the Winnipeg Police Service.The remains of a third victim, 24-year-old Rebecca Contois, were found by police in a separate landfill in May, but officials said Tuesday that the search conditions were more favorable at that site compared to the Prairie Green landfill where Harris and Myran could be.In a Tuesday news conference, Winnipeg Police Chief Danny Smyth explained the decision not to search the Prairie Green landfill, saying the department's assessment showed there is \"no hope for a successful recovery.\"\"The things we are talking about today are horrific and we know that they can be triggering, particularly to those impacted by missing and murdered indigenous women, girls and two-spirit,\" Smyth said.Police have not been able to narrow their search within the 4-acre landfill, according to police forensics unit Inspector Cam MacKid, who was tasked with assessing the site's search conditions. Investigators believe the two women's remains were brought to the site in the same truck load, he said.Since the time the remains were likely put in the Prairie Green landfill, the site has been covered with about 9,000 tons of wet construction mud that stretches about 40 feet deep, MacKid said. The clay has also become tightly compacted by heavy machinery, he explained.Additionally, about 1,500 tons of animal remains and 250 tons of asbestos were strewn throughout the site, which would make it difficult for investigators to identify human remains and pose a health risk to workers, MacKid said.Based on these conditions, he said, police \"made the very difficult decision as a service that this wasn't operationally feasible to conduct a search of this site.\"At the Brady landfill where police found Contois's remains, MacKid said several factors worked in investigators' favor, including loosely packed waste and a short window between when the remains were delivered and police became aware of the location.The garbage truck that delivered the remains to the site also had a GPS locator and onboard video installed which aided police in narrowing down their search perimeter, he said.Harris and Myran belonged to the Long Plain First Nation and Contois was a member of the Crane River First Nation, according to police. A fourth victim -- believed to be an indigenous woman killed around March 15 -- has also been confirmed but not yet identified, police said. Investigators are referring to her as Buffalo Woman at the request of indigenous community advocates, elders and leadership.Police have still not confirmed the location of Buffalo Woman's remains, MacKid said.Victim's children demand a searchMorgan Harris's daughters decried the police decision not to look for their mother's body and are demanding that a search be conducted.In a news conference Tuesday, Kera and Cambria Harris said police informed them of the choice on Monday before announcing it to the public, according to CBC News.\"They say that they can't search because it's not feasible,\" Cambria Harris said, according to CBC. \"Is human life not feasible?\"\"Time and time again, our Indigenous women and brothers and sisters have to come here, and we have to shout and we have to raise our voices begging for change and begging for justice for our people, and that is wrong,\" she said, according to the report.The sisters mourned the loss of their mother without a proper burial and called on the police to seek help from other agencies, CBC reported.\"How can you even fathom the idea to leave them there? These women are deserving of a proper resting place, not to be left alone in a landfill in the dead of winter,\" Kera Harris said according to CBC.The-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2022 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It\u2019s a day to honour the unique struggles, strengths, and potential of women around the world, far too many of whom face violence, poverty, environmental destruction, disease, and discrimination on a daily basis.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs First Peoples, we believe that a community cannot be healthy if its women are not supported and loved \u2013 strong women lead to strong families, communities, and nations,\u201d said Deputy Grand Chief Denise Stonefish of the Association of Iroquois and Allied Indians (AIAI). \u201cWe have come a long way in terms of equality and respect over the years, in fact, Ontario now has 38 elected women Chiefs serving. But there are still many hurdles to overcome.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe staggeringly high numbers of missing and murdered Indigenous women has drawn world attention. A 2015 United Nations report found that young aboriginal women are five times more likely to die under violent circumstances, as compared with their non-Indigenous counterparts.\n\u00a0\nThe search for Delaine Copenace, the missing 16-year-old girl in Kenora is entering its second week. A vigil is being organized for Tuesday evening in Thunder Bay, Ont., to support the family of the teenager.\n\u00a0\nOn September 9 of 2015, Chiefs of Ontario launched the Who Is She campaign \u2013 a fundraising effort aimed at creating a First Nations-led, community-driven process to eradicate violence against Indigenous women and girls. This campaign started through a Chiefs Resolution that stated \u2018Every Indigenous woman and girl should feel safe every time of every day in every place in Canada. We are looking to achieve truth and tangible solutions through a First Nations driven process to end violence in our communities.\u2019\n\u00a0\n\u201cOur responsibility to our women must be clear and focused toward lifting them to the greatest heights of their potential. As men we must also honour ourselves by honouring our women; taking responsibility for healing from domestic violence and violence against women and girls in our First Nations,\u201d said Regional Chief Day. \u201cMen can best serve the important agenda of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls by extending full unfettered support and equal space to women in all aspects of the justice process of women, seeking to be there for women as protectors and promoters of their safety and wellbeing.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRegional Chief Day said that a big part of eliminating the issues of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, is focusing on ending violence through justice interventions and men\u2019s wellness programs. To mark this day, Regional Chief Day is committing the next year toward First Nations men\u2019s wellness issues in an effort to strengthen the supports for First Nation women.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Chiefs of Ontario is a political forum and a secretariat for collective decision making, action, and advocacy for the 133 First Nation communities located within the boundaries of the province of Ontario, Canada.

PAUL, Minn. (AP) \u2014 Violence against Native American women is drawing the attention of Minnesota lawmakers, with a proposal to study its prevalence and recommend ways to reduce it.Rep. Mary Kunesh-Podein, a Democrat from New Brighton, said her bill aims to shed light on the issue \u2014 and also be \"the beginning of some healing.\" Native American groups have sometimes complained that disappearances of Native American women are an overlooked problem.\"What it'll do is acknowledge their pain and presence in this day and age and the historical pain that communities have had to deal with,\" Kunesh-Podein said.Her bill is moving through committees in the House and being considered for possible inclusion in a broader public safety proposal this year.Putting numbers to the problem is difficult. In Canada, a 2014 study by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police found nearly 1,200 aboriginal women were killed or disappeared between 1980 and 2012, with some officials saying they thought the actual number was higher and more study called for. In Washington state, lawmakers recently directed state police to increase resources for reporting and identifying missing Native American women.A complex web of federal, state and tribal law enforcement jurisdictions doesn't always provide accurate or complete racial and ethnic data, said Liz Richards, the director of the Minnesota Coalition for Battered Women.Tribal prosecutors are limited in their ability to charge suspects when they leave, and the FBI handles felony-level offenses. Local police outside of reservations and tribal areas aren't able to investigate crimes committed on reservations. And sometimes violent crime simply goes unreported.Yet the numbers that are available paint a bleak picture. Homicide rates for Native American women in Minnesota was seven times that of white women between 1990 and 2016, according to the Minnesota Department of Health.\"Clearly there's a disproportionate number of native American women killed,\" Richards said.Kunesh-Podein says her proposal would suggest ways law enforcement can better track violence against indigenous people.Mysti Babineau, a member of the Red Lake Nation, testified for Kunesh-Podein's bill last week before the House Public Safety Committee. Babineau, 32, fought through tears as she described her mother's disappearance when she was just 2; being sexually assaulted herself twice; and her grandmother's fatal stabbing.Her experience isn't unique, Babineau testified.\"Many of my sisters, many of my relations go through this,\" she told lawmakers. \"This problem needs to be addressed.

Just a little over a week after the man charged with second-degree murder in her death was acquitted of that crime, hundreds of people gathered at Nathan Phillips Square in Toronto on Saturday demanding justice for Tina Fontaine and others like her.The rally, which replicated others that have taken place across the country,  came ahead of the 40th International Women\u2019s Day, which takes place March 8. The \u201cJustice For Tina Fontaine\u201d rally was joined this year by the International Women\u2019s Day Toronto March, which is made up of a coalition of groups that organize around women\u2019s issues.A stream of speakers (most Indigenous women) all had a similar refrain: Fontaine, 15, was failed not just by a criminal justice system that did not secure a conviction in her case, but by every other institution she came in contact with in her short life.Read more:Article Continued BelowOpinion | There can be no reconciliation as long as Indigenous lives are expendableEditorial | The law has done its job, but there must be justice for Tina FontaineAcquittal of Raymond Cormier in Tina Fontaine\u2019s death disappoints Winnipeg police chiefBefore she was pulled from Winnipeg\u2019s Red River in the summer of 2014, her body wrapped in a blanket that had been weighed down by rocks, Fontaine was supposed to be in the care of Manitoba\u2019s Child and Family Services. She was put in a hotel room with little monitoring. When she disappeared, social workers did not tell her family back home. During the time she was reported missing, police came across her in a car with an older man and did nothing.\u201cNo more stolen children, no more children are going to leave our community \u2026 and be put in hotel rooms,\u201d Suzanne Smoke of the American Indian Movement told the crowd. Posters and banners in the crowd read \u201cnever again\u201d and \u201cwithout justice there can be no peace of reconciliation.\u201d New Democrat MP Charlie Angus (Timmins), who was also in attendance, called the foster care system\u2019s effect on Indigenous children a conduit for gangs and murdered young women. \u201cIt is a modern day crime,\u201d he said, adding \u201cTina gives us a face to a generation of children who have been taken and abandoned.\u201dIn February, a jury in Winnipeg found Raymond Cormier not guilty of second-degree murder in the 2014 death of Fontaine. Cormier, in undercover police tapes, admitted that he had sex with the teen and was heard saying he bet Fontaine was killed because he found out she was only 15.The defence had argued that the tapes were hard to hear, that the transcriptions could be wrong and that Cormier\u2019s denial to police of any involvement was the real truth.There was no DNA evidence linking him to Fontaine and experts could not determine how she died.\u201cI\u2019ve learned not to expect much of the Canadian justice system, I never have,\u201d said 16-year-old Madyson Arscott at Saturday\u2019s rally. \u201cI was not surprised by the verdict \u2026 . My friends, the system is not broken, it is working exactly as it should be.\u201d Arscott helped to organize Saturday\u2019s rally. Her message to Indigenous youth: \u201cYou are worth the effort.\u201d The decision in Fontaine\u2019s case came just days after a Saskatchewan farmer was acquitted in the murder of 22-year-old Cree man Coulten Boushie. The composition of the jury in the trial came under attack for an apparent lack of Indigenous members and the Boushie family has said they were treated poorly by the RCMP. The federal government\u2019s inquest into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, of which there are thousands, is conducting hearings across the country for people to give testimony. The national inquiry, though, has had its fair share of problems with high staff turnover, communication problems and concerns about caring for people after they have gone through the traumatic experience of testifying about their lost loved ones.The deaths of 11 children who have died in Ontario while in the care of children and youth services is currently under review by the coroner. Seven of the 11 youths in the review, who died between January 2014 and July 2017, were Indigenous.With Star filesDelivered dailyThe Morning Headlines\u00a0NewsletterSubscribeThe Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E\u00a01E6.

The local indigenous community has given her the name Buffalo Woman (Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe).Police believe all four women were killed by Jeremy Skibicki of Winnipeg, who was charged with four counts of first-degree murder. The 35-year-old is now in police custody. His lawyer has told Canadian media that he intends to plead not guilty.The murders have brought renewed attention to Canada's history of disproportionate violence faced by indigenous women, which was called a \"genocide\" by a national public inquiry in 2019.A report by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 2016 estimated that around 1,200 First Nations women had been killed or gone missing between 1980 and 2012.But the National Inquiry into Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls concluded that there is \"no reliable estimate\", and added that the RCMP's figure is narrow in scope.\nRecommended StoriesHuffPostSeveral Indigenous Women\u2019s Remains Are Missing.

For Gauthier, the day was emotional and brought back many memories. \nBut it was also filled with a touch of optimism now that 231 recommendations from the inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls have been put on paper.\n\u201cThey are going to hear what we have to say, first of all,\" she said. \"It is a beginning and I hope it does bring change.\u201d\nSpeaking in the grand hall of the Canadian Museum of History, facing Parliament Hill across the Ottawa River, the inquiry's chief commissioner, Marion Buller, said that nothing short of an absolute paradigm-shift is in order from all levels of government and public institutions to address the issue\u2014one her commission labelled frankly as a genocide. \nThe tragedy, Buller said, is a direct result of a \u201cpersistent and deliberate pattern of systemic racial and gendered human and Indigenous rights violations and abuses, perpetuated historically and maintained today by the Canadian state.\u201d\nThe term has instantly become a flashpoint, the subject of arguments over whether it denotes intentionality in the hundreds of killings and disappearances the inquiry examined, whether it's fair if it does, whether the label matters.\nFor his part, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stopped short of using the term\u2014despite being directly asked to do so in a call from the crowd\u2014when he spoke after accepting the report.\nInstead, Trudeau said violence against Indigenous women and girls is \u201cnot a relic of Canada's past,\u201d but part of its present, and the justice system has failed them.\n\u201cTime and again, we have heard of their disappearance, violence, or even death being labelled low priority or ignored,\u201d he said.\nHe received the report from the commissioners after they performed a traditional ceremony, including coating its pages with medicine.\nIn a speech later in Vancouver to a gender equality conference with numerous political leaders from around the world, Trudeau did use the term.\n\u201cEarlier this morning the national inquiry formally presented their final report in which they found that the tragic violence that Indigenous women and girls have experienced amounts to genocide.\u201d\nThe inquiry report itself uses the term \u201cgenocide\" dozens of times, starting in the first paragraph of Buller's preface: \"This report is about deliberate race, identity and gender-based genocide,\u201d she wrote.\nAfter yesterday's ceremony, Buller said the commission does not need to hear the word \u201cgenocide\u201d out of Trudeau's mouth; it heard the truth from families and survivors.\nThat Indigenous women and girls have been victims of genocide was an \u201cinescapable conclusion\u201d for the commission, she said.\nWhen asked if she agreed with the use of the term, Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett said the Liberal government accepts the findings of the commissioners, adding it has heard for a long time that \u201cracism and sexism kills.\u201d\nThe federal government will leave the discussion of the use of the term \u201cgenocide\u201d to academics and experts, said Justice Minister David Lametti. \nHe said the government has a responsibility to the families and survivors to fix the problem.\nConservative Indigenous-affairs critic Cathy McLeod said the discussion around the term was a distraction from the value of the report's findings and would not say whether she agreed with the use of the word.\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said he thinks genocide is an accurate word to use for what he calls \u201ca complete system failure\u201d for Indigenous women and girls.\nBuller told the crowd she and her three fellow commissioners are holding up a mirror to the country, reflecting what they heard from more than 2,300 people over two years of cross-country public hearings and work to gather evidence.\nCommissioner Qajaq Robinson said the inquiry tested her to her core as a non-Indigenous person, struggling to come to terms with her \u201crole in Canada's genocide.\u201d\n\u201cShame, guilt, denial, that urge to say, 'No, no, no, that's not what this is,' \" she said. \"But it's the truth. It's our truth. It's my truth, it's your truth. The families, survivors, and Indigenous peoples across this country have brought this truth to light.\u201d\n(Robinson was born and raised in Nunavut, speaks Inuktitut and practises Aboriginal law, but her appointment as a member of a commission that had no Inuk member was questioned when the inquiry began.)\nThe report's 231 recommendations\u2014framed as \u201ccalls for justice\u201d\u2014include developing an effective response to human-trafficking cases and sexual exploitation and violence, including in the sex industry.\nThese moves are not optional, but constitute legal imperatives, the report says.\nAdditional calls include establishing a national Indigenous- and human-rights ombudsperson and a national Indigenous- and human-rights tribunal.\nThe report also focuses on a call for people in the justice system and in police services to acknowledge that the historical and current relationship with Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people has been largely defined by colonialism, racism, bias and discrimination.\nMissing and murdered Indigenous women are believed to number in the thousands in Canada, but the report says that despite the commission's best efforts to quantify the extent of the tragedy, \u201cno one knows an exact number.\u201d\nIn 2005, the Native Women's Association of Canada created a database tracking cases and produced a 2010 report documenting 582 missing and murdered Indigenous women. In 2014, the RCMP released a national overview and pegged the number of cases between 1980 and 2012 at nearly 1,200. Other unverified estimates are far higher.\nEvelyne Youngchief, a survivor of violence who works on the front lines on the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, said yesterday the report may offer closure to some, but not her.\nMore and more Indigenous women continue to go missing and be murdered, she said.\n\u201cIt's going to keep happening,\" she said. \"It's not going to end any time soon. When are they going to stop murdering and taking our women?\u201d\nThe full MMIWG Inquiry report is available at www.mmiwg-ffada.ca/\nFree story:\u00a0 \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\nMore National\n\n 'Beer  insiders'  fuelling  criticism:  Fedeli  \n\n MMIW violence not 'relic of our past': PM  \n\n Teen punching protocol: cops  \n\n 'Purple heroin' present  in Montreal, say police  \n\n MMIW 'genocide' everyone's problem: report  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch form\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nPoll\n\n\n\nWhich championship series are you more excited to watch?\n Stanley Cup final\n NBA Finals \n Couldn\u2019t care less \n Choices\n \nVote\n\n\n\n\nOlder polls\nResults\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\nHomeTimes Online PDF\nDaily Headlines\nRSS Feeds\nFacebook\nTwitter\n\nLocalNews\nDistrict\nSports\nBusiness\nHealth & Wellness\nObituaries\nBirths\nEditorials\nColumns\nLetter to the Editor\nPhoto Gallery\nAround Town\nWeekly Poll\nRainy River Record\n\nGlobalNational\nSports\nBusiness\nHealth & Wellness\nScience\nTechnology\nInternational\nPeople\nLife\nRecipes\n\nClassifiedsLocal Classifieds\nJobs & Tenders\nObituaries\nGarage Sales\nPlace a Classified\nSubscribe to the Digital Edition\n\nAbout UsAdvertise\nPrivacy Policy\nSubscriptions\nCreating the Times\nRainy River Record\nTimes Printing\nTimes Web Design\n\nContact UsContact \nDaily Headlines\nCarrier Application\nSubmit a Tip\nSubmissions\n\nSpecial Section100 Years 100 Stories\nCheers & Jeers\nDiscover Magazine\nNorthwestern Ontario Map\nTV Listings\nWho's Online\nfftimes150 Submissions\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a9 2018 Fort Frances Times Ltd.

She was later taken to hospital where she was picked up by social workers.She was put in a downtown hotel but ran away again shortly before she was killed.The trial is scheduled to last for five weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nNational\n\nJustice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nPost a comment as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmoticons \n\n\n[smile]\n[beam]\n[wink]\n[sad]\n[cool]\n[innocent]\n[rolleyes]\n[whistling]\n[lol]\n[huh]\n[tongue]\n[love]\n[sleeping]\n[yawn]\n[unsure]\n[angry]\n[blink]\n[crying]\n[ohmy]\n[scared]\n[sleep]\n[sneaky]\n[tongue_smile]\n[thumbdown]\n[thumbup]\n[censored]\n[happybirthday]\n[ban]\n[spam]\n[offtopic]\n[batman]\n[ninja]\n[pirate]\n[alien]\n\n\n\nComment Text\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\nPost comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nReport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\nReport Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nWatch this discussion.\nStop watching this discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Get an email notification whenever someone contributes to the discussion\n                        \n\n                            Notifications from this discussion will be disabled.\n                        \n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\n\nStart watching\nStop watching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (0) comments \n                            \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the discussion.\n\n\nLog In\n\n\n\nKeep it Clean.

The bodies of the other three have not yet been found.On Tuesday, Winnipeg police said they found another body - that of Ms Beardy - though there is no evidence to suggest she was a victim of the same alleged killer.\"At this time, we have no information to suggest that there are any other victims, or that this investigation is related to any previous incidents,\" Inspector Shawn Pike told reporters.Indigenous women are 12 times more likely to be murdered or missing than other women in Canada, according to a 2019 report by Canada's Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women inquiry.Police said Ms Beardy is from Lake St Martin First Nation and had been living in Winnipeg. She had not been reported as a missing person.Police said they believe her body was transported to the landfill by a garbage truck, likely a few hours before she was found.Her death, which police have deemed suspicious, is now being investigated by the homicide unit.The recovery of Ms Beardy's body comes amid ongoing pressure on Winnipeg police to search landfills in the city for the remains of the other missing women.The bodies of Morgan Beatrice Harris, 39, Marcedes Myran, 26, and a third unidentified victim, whom First Nations elders have named Buffalo Woman, have yet to be found.All three, along with Ms Contois, are believed to have been killed by Jeremy Skibicki, who has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder.Story continuesA feasibility study, funded in part by Canada's federal government, is now under way to determine whether it is possible to search Prairie Green landfill, where the bodies of Ms Harris and Ms Myran are believed to be.Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs Grand Chief Cathy Merrick, head of the feasibility study, has called for both Brady landfill and Prairie Green landfill to be shut down and searched further.\"It's a dumping ground for people that are killing our First Nation women,\" Ms Merrick told Canadian news outlet CTV.Red dresses were hung outside Brady landfill on Tuesday after the body of Ms Beardy was found, in honour of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls in Canada.The National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls found that about 1,200 First Nations women in Canada had been murdered or gone missing between 1980 and 2012. Advocates believe the number is higher.AdvertisementAdvertisementTRENDINGYahoo NewsExonerated Central Park 5 member Yusef Salaam responds to Trump charges with full-page adYahoo News\u00b74 min readINSIDERBrooke Shields says John F.

Some families alleged discrimination or misconduct by police during pre-inquiry consultations.\nMany of the recommendations from families and stakeholders appear to have shaped the mandate of the inquiry.\nBut while the role of police or police conduct was flagged as something that should be\u00a0a priority for examination during\u00a0the inquiry,\u00a0in the draft document, there is no specific directive to look into that.\nThe document also directs commissioners not to interfere with ongoing criminal investigations and discourages them from recommending civil or criminal liability of a person or organization.\nCommissioners are encouraged to give weight to previous studies such as the TRC final report, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, as well as five other reports specifically relating to violence against Indigenous women and girls.\nDetails about the scope and mandate of the national inquiry has been long anticipated by families of victims.\nThe Liberal government announced Phase 1 of a national inquiry shortly after it took office last December.\nIn June, Status of Women Minister Patty Hadju told CBC News the government was \u201cvery close\u201d to making an announcement about Phase 2 of the national inquiry.\n\u201cI think Canadians can be confident that, before the House rises, we\u2019ll have something to tell them about how this is going to look.\u201d\nFive weeks later, families of missing and murdered women are still waiting for official confirmation of next steps of the inquiry.\nOttawa is in ongoing negotiations with the provinces and territories about terms of reference.\nThe federal budget has committed\u00a0$40 million over two years for the inquiry.\n\n\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

At time of publication, the Star\u2019s research had identified 1,129 cases where an indigenous woman or girl was either murdered, died in suspicious circumstances, or is missing. Nearly half didn't know, or barely knew, their killers, analysis shows. (2014 file photo).\n\n\n\n\nnext\nplay/pause\npre\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHamilton Spectator\n\nBy\nDavid Bruser, Jim Rankin, Joanna Smith, Tanya Talaga, Jennifer Wells and Andrew Bailey\n\n\n\n                            In the seemingly ceaseless tragedy of murdered indigenous women, the country has been left with one crystal-clear impression: the overwhelming majority of those women were in some sort of relationship with their killers.\n                        \n\n                            This is not true.\n                        \n\n                            A Toronto Star analysis suggests 44 per cent of the women were victims of acquaintances, strangers and serial killers. This finding is based on a Star review of publicly available information on more than 750 murder cases. Of that number, 224 murders remain unsolved.\n                        \n\n                            There are many public lists of murdered and missing indigenous women in Canada. The Star compiled those lists into a single database then set out to verify as much information as possible. Relying on newspaper clippings and court documents, the Star's database includes 1,129 names, dates and, when a case was solved, some information on the offenders.\n                        \n\n                            Our review found 420 cases where details of the relationship between victim and offender were known. Some of them date to the 1960s. Of those:\n                        \n\n Half of the victims were domestically related to the perpetrator. This includes all types of family and partner connections.\n\n\n 16 per cent of the offenders were acquaintances; 15 per cent were strangers; and 13 per cent serial killers.\n\n\n                            Aboriginal leaders who reviewed the Star's findings say they show that the killers cannot be easily profiled and that reasons why indigenous women make up a disproportionately high percentage of homicide victims are not so neatly diagnosed.\n                        \n\n                            The Star also obtained details through an access-to-information request to suggest the \"solved\" rate is not as clear-cut as the public RCMP report into missing and murdered indigenous women suggests.\n                        \n\n                            In 2014, the RCMP reported that, from 1980 to 2012, in more than 90 per cent of solved homicide cases and those where the police believe they have identified the killers, the victims knew the perpetrators.\n                        \n\n                            In two reports, the Mounties said the \"known-to\" category includes spouses, family members and acquaintances. The latter category can mean \"close friends, neighbours, authority figures, business relationships, criminal relationships and casual acquaintances.\"\n                        \n\n                            What is a casual acquaintance? A friend of a friend or someone met online? In how many cases did the victim know the perpetrator only briefly, meeting them only once?\n                        \n\n                            The RCMP will not say.\n                        \n\n                            From the start, Alberta's Cold Lake First Nation Chief Bernice Martial has not believed most indigenous women knew their killers and that they were mostly indigenous men: \"I want the facts. I want the data. I want to see proof.\" \n                        \n\n                            Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde wants the definition of \"known to\" clarified.\n                        \n\n                            \"It could be the corner store grocery man, or whoever brings milk to the door. It doesn't necessarily mean the boyfriend,\" Bellegarde says.\n                        \n\n                            \"You need to break this down further and define it. The way you looked at it, only 50 per cent are in relationships. If the RCMP said it was 90 per cent \u2014 well, there is a discrepancy already. It is alarming \u2014 the transparency and openness.\" \n                        \n\n                            In April, then aboriginal affairs minister Bernard Valcourt told First Nations chiefs that, in 70 per cent of the cases of murdered and missing aboriginal women, indigenous men had been the perpetrators.\n                        \n\n                            \"The notion of First Nations women only being killed by their boyfriends and spouses is a myth,\" said Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler of Nishnawbe Aski Nation, which represents 49 northern Ontario First Nations.\n                        \n\n                            Carolyn Bennett, the new indigenous and northern affairs minister, said she was \"appalled\" by Valcourt's remarks.\n                        \n\n                            \"It was misleading for him to characterize it that way and I, at the time, was furious,\" Bennett said.\n                        \n\n                            RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson confirmed the number citing their database \u2014 even though the report issued by the Mounties last year had not noted the ethnicity of perpetrators. But Paulson added a caveat.\n                        \n\n                            \"It is not the ethnicity of the offender that is relevant, but rather the relationship between the victim and offender that guides our focus with respect to prevention,\" Paulson wrote to Martial.\n                        \n\n                            Most homicides involving female victims of all ethnicities involve family or intimate partner violence, Paulson added, but the rate is actually lower for aboriginal women \u2014 62 per cent compared to 74 per cent for non-aboriginal women.\n                        \n\n                            In its followup report, the RCMP said in the past couple of years, the offender was known to the victim in every solved homicide of an aboriginal woman in RCMP jurisdictions. \n                        \n\n                            Since the RCMP found that aboriginal women are significantly more likely than other women to be killed by an acquaintance \u2014 17 per cent of the aboriginal female homicides involved casual acquaintances and 7 per cent criminal relationships \u2014 uncertainty surrounds hundreds of cases.\n                        \n\n                             \"You need to break this down further and define it,\" said Bellegarde.\n                        \n\n                            Are police forces working together, asks Bellegarde, by sharing correct information? And are there protocols to improve communications?\n                        \n\n                            \"This all speaks to the bigger realm of why there needs to be an inquiry coupled with an action plan,\" he said.\n                        \n\n                            Bennett, one of the ministers charged with establishing the national inquiry, said cases that involve family violence should be viewed through a wider lens.\n                        \n\n                            \"We've got to go way back upstream to actually look at the effects of colonization and residential schools on the indigenous population in Canada,\" Bennett said. \n                        \n\nSecrecy and the list\n\n\n                            The Star shared its database findings with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police two months ago and on two occasions since to check the accuracy of its research. The Star also asked several questions about how the RCMP arrived at its findings.\n                        \n\n                            In May 2014, the Star made an access to information request for the RCMP's database of murdered and missing indigenous women and girls.\n                        \n\n                            In early October 2015, some 16 months later, the RCMP released 2,000 pages related to work that led to its 2014 report. All names and personal details of the women and girls were redacted.\n                        \n\n                            The RCMP cited several reasons for redacting information, including personal information, law enforcement investigations and information obtained in confidence. Their 2014 report notes that the Mounties were asked to sign an \"Undertaking of Confidentiality\" to obtain data from Statistics Canada and that other police services had to agree that Statistics Canada could share their data.\n                        \n\n                            On Nov. 13, after more questions from the Star, Janice Armstrong, deputy commissioner of RCMP aboriginal policing, welcomed media efforts to investigate, saying the cases of murdered and missing aboriginal women require \"a co-ordinated response that addresses the underlying root causes of violence.\"\n                        \n\n                            Yet none of our questions was answered. The RCMP database \u2014 notwithstanding the RCMP's already published interpretations of it \u2014 remains a secret.\n                        \n\n                            Seeking clarity on a local level presented its own challenges. On Aug. 13, the Star contacted the Winnipeg Police Service requesting an interview with Project Devote, an integrated task force between the RCMP and Winnipeg police charged with the investigation of unsolved homicides and missing persons in Manitoba involving exploited and \"at risk\" persons. Ethnicity and gender are not predetermining factors for inclusion.\n                        \n\n                            Across a period of more than three months, two trips to Winnipeg and repeated communications, including with the RCMP, Winnipeg police denied the request on Nov. 20. On that date, Winnipeg police did send a list of cases under investigation, but would not indicate which cases involved indigenous persons. Of a current case load of 28, including one male, the Star's own research found 22 cases involving missing and murdered indigenous women. The number could be higher. \n                        \n\n                            The lack of co-operation highlights the barriers to capturing accurately the necessary data. Asked how many members of Project Devote are indigenous, Winnipeg police responded via email that the \"heritage of the investigators on the task force is irrelevant.\"\n                        \n\n                            The Ontario Provincial Police were also reluctant to answer questions about the deaths and disappearance of women in northern Ontario.\n                        \n\n                            Police secrecy masks the scope of the problem, said Nishnawbe Aski Nation Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler.\n                        \n\n                            \"What is the scope of the problem?\" asks Fiddler. \"There is really no definitive picture. If there was a collaborative effort we could get an accurate picture. There is no databank somewhere, no central place where you can find some answers. There is no co-ordinated effort. We know the Ontario Provincial Police has numbers, the RCMP has numbers and even the Native Women's Association of Canada has numbers,\" said Fiddler.\n                        \n\n                            No one can answer simple questions: What is the status of these investigations? Which force is handling the investigations \u2014 the RCMP, the OPP or the Thunder Bay Police? Are they actively investigating these cases?\n                        \n\nSolve rates \n\n\n                            As of November, the Star's research had identified 1,129 cases where an indigenous woman or girl was either murdered, died in suspicious circumstances, or is missing. It is by no means a complete list. In some cases, the Star could not verify details. For those reasons, the Star is sharing an aggregate level analysis of the cases.\n                        \n\n                            In 130 cases \u2014 78 of which were from British Columbia \u2014 the Star could not find information to verify the type of case (murdered or missing), nor any information to exclude them. Of the total, 937 cases are from 1980 to 2015. Looking at the solve rates of homicides, the annual ratio of unsolved to solved cases was higher during the 1980s and 1990s, and is gradually decreasing. \n                        \n\n\n\n\n                            Overall, there are 768 murder cases with 20 identified as murder-suicides. Two hundred and twenty-four are unsolved and, of those, 186 involve killings since 1980.\n                        \n\n                            The Star can't verify the RCMP's claim that 88 per cent of all aboriginal female homicide cases have been solved. The Star's analysis suggests a solve rate of 70 per cent.\n                        \n\n                            The Star analysis also identified 180 unsolved cases between 1980 and 2012; the RCMP cited 120 cases.\n                        \n\n                            The Mounties provided no explanations for the discrepancies.\n                        \n\n                            The RCMP data came from police-reported figures from more than 300 different agencies. The Star analysis is based largely on media reports.\n                        \n\n                            In her letter to the Star, Janice Armstrong, deputy commissioner of RCMP aboriginal policing, said commenting on the discrepancies would be \"inappropriate,\" citing differences in methodology and data sets.\n                        \n\n                            A possible explanation can be found in the fine print of the 2014 RCMP report, which says solved cases include those where the suspect was \"chargeable\" but not charged. In other words, the police recommended the prosecutor lay charges but a charge may not have been laid.\n                        \n\n                            How many homicide cases stalled with no one charged, tried or sent to jail? The RCMP will not say.\n                        \n\n                            The phrase \"suspect chargeable\" appeared throughout the heavily censored 2,000-page document the Star obtained from the RCMP.\n                        \n\n                            Should police lump such cases into the same category as those that came with convictions and certainty for the families of victims?\n                        \n\n                            \"When you take that strict interpretation of solved \u2014 that becomes an issue unto itself. This does not bring any peace to the family, if they are charged and not convicted. Basically, when they do that, there is no justice or healing or closure for the family. The family's pain and hurt is still ongoing ... That has to be reviewed,\" said Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde.\n                        \n\nBehind the numbers\n\n\n                            There are many public lists of murdered and missing indigenous women in Canada, some more detailed than others. The Star compiled a single database from those lists and then went about verifying as much of the information as possible.\n                        \n\n                            Five Star journalists and two Star librarians searched and read through thousands of news stories, obituaries and online legal documents to check the status of cases.\n                        \n\n                            New cases were added and some were removed after the research revealed, for example, that a missing woman had been found or that a murdered woman was not indigenous.\n                        \n\n                            At time of publication, the Star's research had identified 1,129 cases where an indigenous woman or girl was either murdered, died in suspicious circumstances, or is missing.\n                        \n\n                            It is by no means a complete list. In some cases, the Star could not verify details. For those reasons, the Star is choosing to share an aggregate level analysis of the cases.\n                        \n\n                            Star reporters David Bruser, Jim Rankin, Joanna Smith, Tanya Talaga and Jennifer Wells; librarians Astrid Lange and Rick Sznajder; database specialist Andrew Bailey; and demographic experts Hidy Ng and Matthew Cole were involved in the research and analysis.\n                        \n\nCaveats, data at a glance\n\n\n                            In 130 cases \u2014 78 of which were from British Columbia \u2014 the Star could not find information to verify the type of case (murdered vs. missing), nor could the Star find any information to exclude them.\n                        \n\n                            Of the 1,129 cases, 937 are from 1980 to 2015. Looking at solve rates for homicides, the ratio of unsolved to solved cases, by year, was higher in the 80s and 90s, and is decreasing gradually.\n                        \n\n                            Overall, there are 768 murder cases, of which 20 were identified as murder/suicides. Of the murders, 224 are unsolved, with 186 of those cases involving killings since 1980.\n                        \n\n                            Solved totals in the Star analysis do not include cases where an accused was acquitted, but they do count cases where an arrest has been made and a trial is pending, or in instances where an accused has died. The Star also included as solved cases where the outcome was unclear, such as a case where there was a trial but the outcome could not be determined.\n                        \n\n                            There are 171 missing women and girls in the Star database, which is nearly identical to RCMP figures from 2014, which tallied 164 missing cases, dating back to the 50s.\n                        \n\n                            Between 1980 and 2012, the solved rate in the cases of murdered indigenous women compiled by the Star is 70 per cent, which is much lower than the 88 per cent solve rate the RCMP reported in its groundbreaking 2014 report for the same time frame. The RCMP report cited a solve rate for non-aboriginal female homicides to be 89 per cent, based on an analysis of Canada-wide homicides from 1980 to 2012.\n                        \n\n                            The ratio of unsolved to solved murders is decreasing. Murders of aboriginal women and girls peaked in 2005.\n                        \n\n                            Another difference between the Star research and RCMP findings is the number of unsolved cases. The Star analysis identified 180 cases between 1980 and 2012. The RCMP cited 120 cases for that same period.\n                        \n\n                            It is unclear why there are such large differences. The RCMP data came from police-reported figures from more than 300 agencies. The Star analysis is based largely on media reports.\n                        \n\n                            The Star shared a findings package with the RCMP and flagged the differences in letters to Commissioner Bob Paulson.\n                        \n\n                            In a letter to the Star, RCMP Deputy Commissioner Janice Armstrong cited the differences in source material as a factor and wrote that it would therefore be \"inappropriate\" to comment on the differences.\n                        \n\n                            The RCMP did not answer a long list of questions posed by the Star.\n                        \n\n                            Armstrong, in her letter to the Star, said the RCMP welcomes \"actions that result in positive outcomes in the lives of Aboriginal women and girls\" and expressed appreciation that the Star conducted an independent investigation that can \"further raise awareness among the public as to the reality of this tragedy. We commend your efforts in this endeavour.\"\n                        \n\n                            Unless stated otherwise, figures for murdered and missing indigenous women in Gone are for all years.\n                        \n\nMurdered and missing indigenous women in Canada 2015\n\n\n\n\n\nToronto Star\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Read\n\n\n\nSEE MORE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            UPDATE: Snowfall warning ends, Hamilton and Halton schools open\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Convicted murderer suing police, says he can't get a job\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Left at the altar, this bride had a wedding party anyway\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Eight-hour standoff with police on Hess Street ends peacefully\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Village Restaurant owners reflect on 40 \u2018crazy\u2019 years\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHamilton Local Ads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Loading... \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Name\naddress\n    Location, ST | website.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Bars & Restaurants\nLocal Beauty Salons\nLocal Entertainment\nLocal Doctors & Medical Specialists\nLocal Contractors & Construction\nLocal Education\nLocal Lawn Services\nLocal Lawyers\nLocal Shopping\nLocal Travel\nLocal Tanning\nLocal Used Cars\nLocal Wedding Services\n\n\u25bc\n\n\n\nAdd your business here +\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Your Neighbourhood Today\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Know the risks of getting a tattoo and how to play it safe at Good Point Tattoos in Oakville, ON\n                        \n\nWhile tattoos are popular and safe when done by an experienced tattoo artist, Good Point Tattoos in...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Stefan Ptaszek: Profiles in leadership\n                        \n\nBy David Grossman\n\n\nStefan Ptaszek began to see a pattern of coaching leadership that influenced...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Legal Matters: Do non-competition and non-solicitation agreements work?\n                        \n\nQuestion:\n\n\nAs an employer, can I protect my business by having my employees sign non-competition...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Business use of social media: minimizing the risks and complications of marketing online\n                        \n\nWhile the explosion of social media use opens up lavish opportunities for businesses to market...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Happy 85th birthday East Hamilton Radio\n                        \n\nIn the world of retail, independent retailers are facing a very competitive market from big box...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            HEART HEALTH: Do you know what to do in the event of a heart attack?\n                        \n\nThe first step in heart attack prevention is identifying and reducing risk factors such as...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Converting basements into extra living spaces pays off\n                        \n\nUnfinished basements too often become a place for the extra belongings you don't really have room...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Terrapure Environmental\n                        \n\nTerrapure Environmental\u2019s Stoney Creek Facility has been a fixture in the community of upper Stoney...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            How to get the best value for your real estate dollars\n                        \n\nWhen shopping for great properties, it's not just about the price \u2013 Judy Marsales Real Estate Ltd.,...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Why properly insulating your home is a must\n                        \n\nBarlow Insulation is Hamilton\u2019s and Brantford\u2019s full-service insulation contractor.

Both the Liberals and New Democrats have promised to call a public inquiry if they win the Oct. 19 election.\"It's a wonderful time to get the message out there, don't you think,\" Day said of the federal election.

Women\u2019s suffrage in Canada was not granted until 1918.\n\n\n\nThe North American headdress was earned, each feather representing an act of bravery. \n\n\n\nThere are over 600 different tribes in Canada each with their own culture and belief system.\n\n\n\n\nThe High King of France commissioned Giovanni da Verrazzano to reach Asia by sailing around North America in 1523. He described the coastline as densely populated and full of bonfire smoke, saying it could be smelt from hundreds of miles away at sea. Some academics place the American Aboriginal population at 50 million while some argue it to have been 100 million. Today\u2019s First Nations population of Canada falls around 1.4 million.\n\n\n\nDuring the early days of colonization, Britain saw Aboriginal people as essential to protecting their colonies and considered them powerful allies who helped battle the French during the Seven Year War and fought off American invasion during the War of 1812. \n\n\n\nFirst Nations people played a major role during the fur trade between the 17th and 19th centuries, which attracted merchants from around the world.\n\n\n\nArchaeology tells us that aboriginal people have lived in the Maritimes provinces of Canada for at least 11,000 years.\n\n\n\nAfter the decline of the fur trade and the end of the War of 1812, more settlers came to Canada, creating a large enough population to protect their own borders. First Nations were seen as impeding on economic development and were sent to live on isolated reserves, while more land was set aside to accommodate new settlers. \n\n\n\nAboriginal people have the youngest demographic in Canada, with a median age of 28, while the median age for non-aboriginal Canadians is 41.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ue002 Share\n\n\n\ue003 Tweet\n\n\n\ue004\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2716\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this\n\u2716 close\n\n\n\n Current Slide\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore:\n\n\nCanadian Women\n\n\nMmiw\n\n\nMmaw\n\n\nOntario Aboriginal Women\n\n\nOntario First Nations\n\n\nOntario First Nations Mmiw\n\n\nOntario First Nations Women\n\n\nOntario First Nations Mmiw Inquiry\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggest a correction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAround the Web\n Ontario First Nations to begin fundraising for inquiry Canada's First Nations must vote, to save their sovereignty Ontario government signs political accord with First Nations chiefs Teach for Canada recruits 31 teachers for 7 northern Ontario First Nations Ontario First Nations say coroners don't visit sites of unexpected deaths \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nClick here to view Conversations\n\n\nConversations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested For You\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOLLOW HUFFPOST\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nEmail Address\n\n\n\n\nPlease check the checkbox to indicate your consent\n\nOptions\n\n\nHuffPost Daily Brief\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\n\n                                        Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..\n                                      \n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nHuffPost\n\n\n\n \nPolitics\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nHuffPost\n\nFollow\n\n\nPolitics\n\nFollow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Plus\n\n\n\nHuffPost\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRSS\n\n\n\nThe Huffington Post\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\nAll RSS / Feeds\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone\n\n\n\nAvailable on the App Store\n\n\nAndroid App on Google Play\n\n\nGet it at Blackberry App World\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch The Huffington Post\nEnter Search Terms\n\nSubmit Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadvertise\n\n\nlog in\n\n\nmake HuffPost your home page\n\n\nRSS\n\n\ncareers\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\n\nuser agreement\n\n\nprivacy policy\n\n\ncomment policy\n\n\nabout us\n\n\nabout our ads\n\n\ncontact us\n\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a92015 TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.\n \"The Huffington Post\" is a registered trademark of TheHuffingtonPost.com, Inc.

But as time passed, tragedy would strike the close-knit group over and over again.\nIn\u00a02007, the body of 17-year-old Fonessa Bruyere was found on the outskirts of Winnipeg. Her murder is still unsolved.\nIn\u00a02011, 15-year-old Clark Stevenson was stabbed to death by another youth.\nFour years ago, Tina's 72-pound body, wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down by rocks, was pulled from the Red River. In February, a jury acquitted Raymond Cormier in the 15-year-old's death. That sparked rallies across the country.\nAnother\u00a0murder left the small group of family and friends utterly devastated.\nLast year, 29-year-old Jeanenne Fontaine, Tina's cousin and a mother of three, was shot dead. Her body was found in her home which had been set ablaze. Three men have been charged.\n\"When you hear the statistics, you don't really put two and two together \u2026 but a personal story like that, where four out of a dozen kids (are killed), look at the statistics on that,\" Stevenson said.\n\"Four of a dozen kids will not make it given the way things are right now \u2014 the racism, the foster-care system, all of the systems that are continuing to fail.\"\nOn the first anniversary of Jeanenne Fontaine's murder, two of the children who have grown into adults, Angel and Rose Fontaine, wanted to hold a smudge. Five members from the childhood friendship group gathered\u00a0at the centre where they used to spend their carefree summer days.\nThey prayed, shared food, drummed and supported each other.\n\"It turned into a spontaneous sharing circle and then, after that sharing circle, we decided to do another one and another one and another one,\" Stevenson said.\nThe group has picked up a few other members. Some are family but others are people from the community who also need to heal. No one is turned away.\nAs it came closer to August and the fourth anniversary of the discovery of Tina's body, they decided to host a special potluck.\nIn a post on Facebook, Katie Fontaine said everything is done in cycles of four to honour the four directions. The anniversary marked \"a time to usher in healing for our family.\"\n\"A feast brings community together so they can help you heal.\"\nStevenson isn't sure what the future is for\u00a0Tina's surviving relatives. For now, they will continue to meet every month to offer each other support.\u00a0\nShe hopes it will grow into a larger movement like the Bear Clan Patrol, a neighbourhood watch group that started after the girl's death.\n\"It's nothing special \u2014\u00a0just showing support to each other, being there, using your time and your skills, being a good helper. I'm doing things that an auntie would do, checking on people, making sure they are OK,\" Stevenson said.\n\"We can't wait around for someone to help us. We just have to use the tools that we know\u00a0\u2014 smudging, drumming, sharing, sharing a meal.\"\n\nKelly Geraldine Malone, The Canadian Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore regional stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                Thousands attend funeral service for officers killed in Fredericton shooting\n                            \n\nUpdated 44 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                Manafort judge says he fears for jurors' safety\n                            \n\nUpdated 10 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                Saudi Arabia prepares for the annual Muslim hajj pilgrimage\n                            \n\nUpdated 3 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                The Latest: Emotional funeral for slain Fredericton officers wraps up\n                            \n\nUpdated 1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                Italy's leader demands safe roads;

        "body": "BBCWinnipeg: A daughter's quest to find her mother's remainsJuly 27, 2023 at 4:28 PM\u00b78 min readCambria has been leading the search for her mother's remains at the landfillPolice believe the remains of four indigenous women murdered by a serial killer were dumped in a landfill. But officials have yet to recover their bodies, leaving it up to the victims' family members to keep the search alive, reports Brandi Morin.A makeshift barricade of tyres and scraps of white-painted fence lays across a paved road leading to the Brady Landfill on the outskirts of the Canadian city of Winnipeg.Mohawk warrior flags, which feature the face of an indigenous man superimposed on a yellow sunburst on a red background, wave in the wind. Indigenous blockaders dressed in camouflage gear stand guard nearby, keeping people from entering.They have been standing sentry for weeks, in protest, after police announced they believe the bodies of indigenous women murdered by a serial killer may be buried there.Behind their barrier is 22-year-old Cambria Harris. And she will stop at nothing to find her mother's body.Last December, Winnipeg police told Cambria and other family members that her mother Morgan Harris, 39, of Long Plain First Nation had allegedly been murdered by a man they accuse of being a serial killer.Police claim Jeremy Skibicki killed four women, including Harris, and dumped their bodies in two different landfills over a three-month span in the spring of 2022.All the women were indigenous. None of their bodies have been recovered.He is charged with first degree murder in the deaths of Harris; Marcedes Myran, 26, also of Long Plain First Nation; Rebecca Contois, 24, of O-Chi-Chak-Ko-Sipi First Nation; and an unknown woman who was given the ceremonial name of Buffalo Woman by indigenous elders.In the months before hearing the devastating news of her mother's death, Cambria was on another desperate search - looking for her missing mother on the streets, homeless shelters and other places where Morgan would hang out.The moment she learned of her mother's fate on a December day at police headquarters, was \"heartbreaking\", she said.Her mother's cousin Kirstin Witwicki grew up with Morgan Harris on the north side of Winnipeg but the cousins drifted apart when Morgan became addicted to drugs.\"Addictions are just people trying to turn off the pain,\" she told the BBC. But still, Harris was \"fearless, someone who spoke her mind\".\"She was tiny but tough. And I think whatever this man did to her, she must have fought. She did not go down without a fight. I know that in my soul. But that's the hard part, I try not to think about what she was thinking.\"That toughness has been passed onto Cambria, who has been fighting to have her mother's body and the bodies of other victims recovered from the landfills where they were buried.Cambria Harris holds a beaded red dress someone made for her. Red dresses have come to symbolize the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women and girlsWhen police told Cambria that they had no plans to search the Prairie Green Landfill where the remains of her and Marcedes Myran are believed to be, Cambria said she \"screamed right at the homicide investigators\", she told the BBC from her home in Winnipeg in May.\"What if your mother or your loved one ended up in a landfill and you were told that they would not search for your loved one and that they're going to be there for time immemorial? There's a chance that my mother's bones are still there,\" she said.Police told her too much time had passed and a search was \"unfeasible\".After police initially declined to search the landfill, and under pressure from the families and their supporters, the federal government funded a study to determine if a search would indeed be possible. It concluded that a search could take up to three years, cost up to C$184 million ($134m, \u00a3109m), and workers would be exposed to hazardous chemicalsEarlier this month, the premier of the province of Manitoba, Heather Stefanson, met with relatives of the victims, including Cambria, and told them the province wouldn't support a landfill search.It would put workers in danger with no assurances of a result, she said.The decision was met with anger by the families, supporters and indigenous leaders.\"Why aren't we looking and what does it come down to? To a price tag and not the price of indigenous women's lives being stolen,\" Cambria said.Beyond the pain felt by the families of the murdered women, the issue has touched a raw nerve in the city and beyond.Canada has long faced a crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. According to the RCMP, indigenous women make up 10% of the population of missing women in Canada, and 16% of female homicides. Indigenous women make up about 4% of the female population in Canada.While the issue is nationwide, it has touched Winnipeg - a city of some one million in the heart of the Canadian prairies - deeply.The city gets its name from the Cree words \"Win,\" (muddy) and \"nipee,\" water, and the Red River winds its way through it.In 2014, the body of 15-year-old Tina Fontaine, of Saugeen First Nation, was pulled from the river near the Alexander Docks adjacent to the city's centre.On the trail of the murdered and the missingGiving a voice to missing and murdered womenThe murder of the young teenager was a tipping point in Canada, leading to calls that eventually helped launch a national inquiry into violence against indigenous women and girls.Cambria was one of thousands who took to the streets in protest. She was 14 at the time.In 2019, the national inquiry concluded these women were victims of a \"Canadian genocide\" driven by \"state actions and inactions rooted in colonialism and colonial ideologies\".Nahanni Fontaine, of Saugeen First Nation, and a provincial politician with the left-leaning New Democratic Party, says the killings of the four women and the fight over the search for their bodies is another cultural turning point.\"In a perfect world, they would've started immediately and just gave it their all,\" said Fontaine, who is not related to Tina Fontaine.Cambria says generational trauma contributed to her mother's addictionCambria was born and raised in Winnipeg where she lived with her mother - who was \"always there\" and three younger siblings, \"always being surrounded by family\", until she was six.Then, one weekend, her world dramatically shifted.She came home from a sleepover and found it surrounded by police, with her belongings, and those of one of her sisters, in garbage bags.The siblings were taken away by child services.Cambria doesn't know why they were taken, she was never given a specific reason, but thinks it was most likely due to her mother's growing drug addiction. She was scared that day and not allowed to see her mother.\"You're being told to stay in the car and that you're going for a long sleepover, which ends up being 10 plus years and lasting all the way until you're 18.\"Cambria was placed in the care of her maternal aunt, Crystal, along with her sister. Cambria and her siblings kept in regular contact with their mother until she ended up on the streets.Like many indigenous families, Cambria says the pain that afflicted her family took hold generations ago.Her great-grandparents left the Long Plain First Nation in the late 1800s due to insufficient food rations provided by the federal authorities and ended up living in the Macgregor landfill north of Winnipeg in a rundown shack.Now, her own mother's body lays somewhere in another landfill.Her grandmother was sent to a residential school - institutions where many suffered physical, emotional and sexual abuse and children were often housed in poorly built, poorly heated, and unsanitary facilities.The family trauma was handed down through generations, says Cambria, including to her mother.In her teenage years, Cambria herself struggled.\"I was really angry for a long time, I won't lie, I wasn't the greatest kid either,\" she said. \"But I got sick of running away from my problems and I started facing them head on.\"At 18 Cambria gave birth to her daughter Willow, now three, and went on to graduate high school.Now, she has turned her attention to finding justice for her mother and the other three women, and bringing them home.\"I turned my grief and my anger into something beautiful,\" she said.Find out more\"We are not trash!\" A daughter's fight to bury her mother - listen now on BBC OutlookThe fight is not over.The federal government told the BBC that they are still considering whether they will fund a search.A blockade erected in support of a search outside one city landfill was torn down 18 July, after a court granted Winnipeg an injunction to remove the barricade over safety concerns.Another camp has since gone up outside the city's Museum for Human Rights.For Cambria, there is no question about keeping pressure on authorities to search for her mother's and the other victims' remains.\"They're telling me that my mother's dead, but where? Well, if she has been murdered, she needs to be retrieved,\" she said.\"And so does Marcedes Myran because this landfill is essentially a giant burial site, an unmarked grave at that.\"Yahoo!USPoliticsWorldCOVID-19Climate ChangeHealthScienceOriginalsContact UsTerms and Privacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardHelpShare your feedbackAbout UsAbout Our AdsSite mapFollow us ontwitterfacebookinstagramDownload our app\u00a9 2023 Yahoo.

We demand answers now.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Status of Women Minister Kellie Leitch\u2019s office released to the media a letter written by RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson and addressed to Martial. In the letter, Paulson said \u201cconsolidated data\u201d from about 300 police agencies produced the 70 per cent statistic.\nPaulson was responding to a letter from Martial who wrote the top Mountie asking for data to back up Valcourt\u2019s claim. Valcourt mentioned the 70 per cent statistic during a closed-door meeting in Calgary last month which Martial attended.\nThe RCMP initially refused to back Valcourt saying its \u201cbias-free policing policy\u201d prevented the federal force from releasing ethnically-based information on perpetrators. Paulson\u2019s decision to confirm the statistic runs counter to the policy.\nAPTN asked the RCMP to explain the decision to release that statistic. The RCMP did not respond.\n\u201cWhy did the RCMP, when for two weeks it stated that they have a bias-free policing policy\u2026all of a sudden change their policy within this time frame?\u201d said Martial.\nAssembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde on Friday added his voice to the ongoing controversy and called on the RCMP and Valcourt to share all its information on murdered and missing Indigenous women with First Nations.\n\u201cIt is absolutely unacceptable that important information on a priority issue is being withheld from First Nations,\u201d said Bellegarde, in a statement. \u201cThe federal government and the RCMP must immediately release all the information they have to First Nations so we can better understand the current situation and work together toward solutions.\u201d\nBellegarde said he would be writing the RCMP to formally request the information.\nThe national chief also took aim at Valcourt for his initial decision to use the statistic to counter public inquiry calls from chiefs during the March Calgary meeting.\n\u201cBlaming the victim is no longer an option,\u201d said Bellegarde.\nMartial has called for Valcourt\u2019s resignation.\nIt seems unlikely the RCMP would be willing to release all the information it gathered as part of its project on murdered and missing Indigenous women. While the RCMP released a report last spring and plans to release a second report in May, Paulson said in the letter existing agreements prevented it from releasing all its raw data.\nPaulson said the RCMP obtained data from Statistics Canada and individual police agencies across the country through signed agreements it would not be disclosing the raw information publicly.\nAs part of its massive project to get a statistical handle on the high number of murdered and missing Indigenous women across the country, the RCMP obtained Statistic Canada\u2019s annual homicide surveys ranging from1980 and 2012. In order to receive the information, the RCMP signed a confidentiality agreement with Stats Can. The RCMP also signed agreements with police departments across the country to obtain their information.\nStats Can\u2019s information, however, did not have completely accurate data on whether perpetrators were Aboriginal or not. The RCMP filled in the gaps found in the data by going back to individual police departments and manually reviewing the files.\n\u201cThe RCMP is currently the source of the most complete information on the Aboriginal identity of the accused,\u201d said Stats Can in a statement.\nFor the first time this coming December, Stats Can\u2019s annual homicide survey will include the \u201cAboriginal identity\u201d of victims and perpetrators.\nUniversity of Ottawa criminology professor Ronald Melchers said the 70 per cent statistic that is causing so much controversy is likely accurate.\n\u201cIt is very consistent with everything I know,\u201d said Melchers, who has extensive experience studying the intersection between criminal justice statistics and public policy. \u201cA lot of people are saying we don\u2019t know this, or we don\u2019t know that, but we do know this very well.\u201d\nMelchers said the RCMP was put in a complicated spot when Valcourt\u2019s musings leaked into the public domain.\n\u201cThey did not want to do it, it violates their internal policy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they were forced into it\u2026they did an assessment of what was the public interest, and the public interest was to release the information.\u201d\njbarrera@aptn.ca\n@JorgeBarrera\n\n\nTags: Aboriginal Affairs Minister Bernard Valcourt, AFN National Chief Perry Bellegarde, Murdered and Missing Indigenous women, RCMP, RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson, Treaty 6 Grand Chief Bernice Martial\n\n\n\nJorge Barrera\n\t\t\t\t\tOttawa Bureau\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tView all posts by Jorge Barrera \u2192 \n\n\n\n\nThe Motion \u2013 Preview\nFood For Thought\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbertaRob\n\n\n\nThe RCMP is the independent investigator.

Smyth spoke about the verdict in the Raymond Cormier trial Friday morning at a Winnipeg police board meeting. THE CANADIAN PRESS/John WoodsWINNIPEG - The chief of police in Winnipeg says the force did its best to investigate the death of a 15-year-old girl whose body was pulled from the Red River.Danny Smyth told the city's police services board Friday that he was disappointed a jury last week acquitted the man accused of killing Tina Fontaine in 2014.\"Frankly, we did our best on this one,\" Smyth said.Raymond Cormier was found not guilty of second-degree murder in Tina's death. Her body was wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down with rocks when it was found in the Red River days after she was reported missing.Smyth told the board he \"certainly had hoped for a different outcome\" but added that it was clear the jury didn't find enough evidence to convict.\"I wish we could have brought forward additional or more compelling evidence,\" he said.Smyth commended the officers who he said worked hard on the case and thanked prosecutors for taking it to trial.\"If not anything else, this trial provided transparency,\" Smyth said. \"The community was able to learn about the investigation. They were able to see evidence and learn about the circumstances that led up to Tina's death.\"He suggested that one positive outcome prompted by Tina's death is that Manitoba no longer uses hotels to house children in care.Tina was raised by her great-aunt, Thelma Favel, on the Sagkeeng First Nation, 120 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg. She left to visit her mother in Winnipeg at the end of June 2014 and became an exploited youth.Favel called Child and Family Services with concerns about Tina, who ran away repeatedly from a youth shelter and hotels where she was placed.She was last seen leaving a downtown hotel, where she told a private contract worker employed by child welfare that she was going to a shopping centre to meet friends.It's not known how Tina died. A pathologist testified at the trial that the girl's death was suspicious because of the manner in which her body was found.(CJOB, CTV Winnipeg, The Canadian Press)\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAdvertise With Us\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Error\nSubmit a Tip\nRefundRefund\n\n\n\nThe Brandon Sun is not accepting comments on this story.\nWhy aren't comments accepted on this story?

(Aaron Vincent Elkaim/THE CANADIAN PRESS)\nTORONTO - First Nations Chiefs in Ontario launched a fundraising campaign Wednesday to help pay for  their own public inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women.\nOntario regional Chief Isadore Day said the chiefs don't want to wait any longer for the federal  government to agree to a public inquiry, and noted the online campaign will help focus on the need for  a national probe.\nThe Assembly of First Nations, the United Nations and several provinces have all called for a national  inquiry into the missing and murdered women, but nothing is being done, added Day.\n\"We're not prepared or willing any further to wait for the federal government or wait for a national  organization to begin this process,\" he said. \"We have support across the country, but somebody had to  step forward and do it.\"\nThe RCMP reported there were more than 1,200 First Nations' women across Canada who were  murdered or disappeared between 1980 and 2014, with many victims being killed by men they lived  with or knew.\nAboriginal leaders know they must act now to protect women in their communities, who can no  longer be treated as \"disposable\" and be \"tossed away\" by society, said Deputy Grand Chief Denise Stonefish.\n\"First Nations families cannot wait for Ottawa to stop indigenous women and girls from disappearing,\"  said Stonefish. \"So First Nations leadership knows it must take action to address the violence, and the  most effective way of stemming this systemic issue is to engage in a First Nations-driven inquiry  process.\"\nThere is no dollar figure set for the fundraising campaign, and Day acknowledged that public inquiries  can be very expensive, but said that wasn't the Chiefs' main concern at this point.\n\"The urgency of this matter is one that has prompted us to not look at the total cost of an inquiry,\" he  said. \"What we're proposing here is we're going to do whatever we can, within our might, with the  goodwill of our partners, to establish the beginning phases of that inquiry.\"\nThe process started by the Ontario Chiefs will help the families of the missing and murdered  aboriginal women prepare for a national inquiry, said Day.\n\"It really is about mobilizing the people, getting the message out there and creating the dialogue,\" he  said. \"We've got a meagre start to the beginning of this inquiry process (but) we're going to keep  going.\"\nPremier Kathleen Wynne applauded the Ontario Chiefs for starting the \"Who Is She\" campaign, which  will feature photos of missing aboriginal women and messages from their families, along with an online donation mechanism.\n\"I think that it is laudable that they are going to be doing a campaign here in Ontario,\" said Wynne. \"I  will continue to raise my voice in the call for a national inquiry.\"\nThe Conservative government has consistently refused to call a public inquiry into the missing and  murdered women, saying more study isn't needed because over 80 per cent of the killings are solved by  police. Both the Liberals and New Democrats have promised to call a public inquiry if they win the Oct.  19 election.\n\"It's a wonderful time to get the message out there, don't you think,\" Day said of the federal election.  \"If we were to wait until the election campaign was over we would be remiss, we would have missed a  good opportunity.\"\n\nNews Archives\n\nYour source for aboriginal information.\n          Subscribe to our other publications as well.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Hiring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW Aboriginal Health Lead\n          The South West Local Health Integration Network (LHIN)\n          London, ON \nApply Sept. 10, 2015\n\n\nNEW Promotions and Marketing Executive, Sales and Marketing Executives (3), and Digital Sales Executive\n          Turtle Island News Multi Media Publishing Company\n          Ohsweken, ON \nApply NOW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetters to the Editor\n\n\n\n\n\nMERX Tender Information is available by clicking on the logo \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from Turtle Island News communications, simply send an e-mail to: dailynews@theturtleislandnews.com with the phrase \"Unsubscribe from Turtle Island News Communications\" in the subject line of your email.\n\u00a9 Copyright 2015 Turtle Island News.

Subjects were divided into age groups spanning 10 years, so the database represents an average in the various groups.\nIt was about a dozen years ago, while doing research on forensic facial construction, that Peckmann first learned no tissue-depth database existed for aboriginal people in North America.\n\u201cThere were these databases for Hispanic populations, for African-American populations, for white European populations, but I was astounded to find out there was nothing for First Nations communities or aboriginal populations anywhere in North America.\u201d\nWhen unidentified human remains are found, Peckmann, a consultant to the Nova Scotia Medical Examiner Service, examines the bones and creates a biological profile that includes information on age, gender, ancestry, stature and whether there was disease or trauma.\nRCMP then put that profile into missing-person databases to see if it matches anyone.\n\u201cIt may not match any of the missing people, or it may match more than one.\n\u201cYou can get a DNA sample (from the remains), but it doesn\u2019t mean anything if you can\u2019t compare it. \u2026 If you don\u2019t know who this person is related to, that (DNA) profile means nothing.\n\u201cThe next step would be to put a face on that person, on the skull, and in order to do that you need what is called tissue-depth measurements.\u201d\nTissue depth at various points greatly affect the appearance of the face and vary between males and females, and people of different ages and ancestries.\n\u201cWe showed in our research that the tissue depths vary substantially between Mi\u2019kmaq populations and the white European population,\u201d Peckmann said.\nBefore the existence of the database, if the skull of an unidentified person of Mi\u2019kmaq ancestry was discovered, \u201cyou would put a face on this unknown skull, but it wouldn\u2019t be representative of who that person was during life so the person would still be unidentified.\u201d\nPeckmann and her collaborators had originally hoped to collect similar measurements for all major aboriginal groups across the country.\n\u201cBut it has taken us 10 years just to get the data for this community, and part of the reason is the lack of funding.

Raymond Cormier was charged more than a year later.\nRaymond Cormier was charged with second-degree murder in the death of Tina Fontaine. (WINNIPEG POLICE DEPARTMENT)\nThe jury deliberated for 11 hours before coming to its decision.\nThere were gasps from Tina\u2019s family and their supporters as the verdict was read. Her great-aunt, Thelma Favel, who raised the girl wept.\n\u201cDo you really think you\u2019re going to get away with it?\u201d yelled one woman who was escorted out of court.\nThe Crown had argued that Cormier convicted himself with his own admissions on secret police recordings, but the defence said numerous forensic holes in the prosecution\u2019s case had left reasonable doubt.\nTina was being sexually exploited after coming to Winnipeg from her home on the Sagkeeng First Nation. Her death prompted renewed calls for an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women.\nThere was no DNA evidence linking Cormier to the teen and doctors who were called to testify said they could not definitively say how Tina died.\nCourt of Queen\u2019s Bench Justice Glenn Joyal had told jurors that if they weren\u2019t satisfied that Tina\u2019s death was caused by an unlawful act, such as being smothered or dumped in the water while unconscious, then they had to find Cormier not guilty.\nIf they decided her death was unlawful, then jurors were to determine if Cormier was responsible.\nOver three weeks of testimony, the jury heard how Tina\u2019s relatively stable upbringing spiralled out of control when her father was murdered. Her mother came back into her life and Tina had gone to visit her in Winnipeg, where the girl descended into life on the streets.\nShe and her boyfriend met the much-older Cormier in the summer of 2014. The jury heard Cormier gave the couple a place to stay, gave Tina drugs and had sex with her.\nWitnesses remember Tina and Cormier fighting in the street over a stolen truck and Tina accusing him of selling her bike for drugs.\nTina went so far as to report a stolen truck to police.\nShe was in the care of social services and was staying at a Winnipeg hotel hotel when she disappeared.\nHer body was found wrapped in a Costco duvet cover that several witnesses said was similar to one Cormier owned. Experts testified the river had washed away any DNA on the cover.\nInvestigators went undercover and offered Cormier an apartment.\nAudio bugs captured what formed the heart of the Crown\u2019s case.\nCormier was recorded telling a woman that he would make a bet that Tina was killed because he had had sex with her and then \u201cI found out she was 15 years old.\u201d\nIn another recording, Cormier was heard arguing with a woman and saying that there was a little girl in a \u201cgrave someplace screaming at the top of her lungs for me to finish the job. And guess what? I finished the job.\u201d\nThe defence took issue with the quality of the recordings and argued that without DNA evidence and no cause of death, the Crown couldn\u2019t prove that Tina didn\u2019t die from a drug overdose or naturally in what Cormier\u2019s lawyer called the \u201cunderbelly of the city.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTina Fontaine\u2019s death and Raymond Cormier\u2019s trial: What the jury heard\nWINNIPEG -Jurors sat through three weeks of evidence in the trial of Raymond Cormier, 56, who on Thursday was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the slaying of 15-year-old Tina Fontaine.\nTina\u2019s body, wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down by rocks, was pulled from the Red River in Winnipeg several days after she disappeared in August 2014. The case reignited calls for a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women.\n\u00a0\nHere is what the jury heard:\nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TINA AND CORMIER\nCourt heard Tina had a happy childhood raised by a great-aunt on the Sagkeeng First Nation, but the girl began to spiral downward when her father was murdered in October 2011.\u00a0 Tina\u2019s mother, who had not been part of her life, re-emerged and Tina started going to Winnipeg to visit her. The girl ended up on the street and was being sexually exploited. Tina\u2019s boyfriend Cody Mason, who was 18 at the time, testified the pair first met Cormier earlier in the summer of\n2014 and told him they didn\u2019t have a place to stay. Cormier, who court heard was a methamphetamine and crack user, took them to a house with a basement. Known to some as Sebastian and to others as Frenchy, Cormier supplied Tina with the prescription drug gabapentin, said Mason, who added he and Tina would also drink and take marijuana and cocaine. Tina told a social worker that Cormier was a much older man who was going to get her a bike. Cormier told friends he had had sex with the 15-year-old. One witness, Sarah Holland, testified she once saw Cormier grope Tina while asking her to \u201cjust do me.\u201d\n\u2014\nTHE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE\nThe cause of Tina\u2019s death was undetermined. Dr. Dennis Rhee testified that he found no definitive injuries on her body or to her internal organs. He said there was no evidence of a sexual assault, no signs of a stabbing or major blunt force trauma. It was estimated her body was in the river for three to seven days. There was no evidence that she drowned, but it couldn\u2019t be ruled out. Christopher Keddy, who works at the RCMP forensics lab, testified that tests showed Tina\u2019s body had a level of alcohol slightly above the legal limit for driving. Keddy also said there was a relatively high level of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. There was no indication of gabapentin, but Keddy said the test the RCMP lab ran might not detect low levels of the drug. Under cross-examination, the defence suggested it couldn\u2019t be ruled out that gabapentin was in Tina\u2019s system at a potentially lethal level in combination with other drugs. There was no DNA evidence linking Cormier to Fontaine.\n\u2014\nTHE DUVET COVER\nThree people connected to Cormier told police he owned the same type of duvet cover that was wrapped around Tina\u2019s body. DNA testing found no traces linking Cormier to the cover. Court heard police tried to find the source of the duvet cover. It was sold by Costco Canada and 864 had been shipped to the three Costco stores in Winnipeg. Police tracked down 100 people who had purchased covers with the same design to ask them whether they still had them. Under cross-examination, investigators acknowledged Costco had given away some of the unsold duvet covers, and police could not rule out whether similar ones had been purchased elsewhere and brought to Winnipeg.\n\u2014\nTHE ARGUMENT ON THE STREET\nOn Aug. 6, about two weeks before Tina\u2019s body was found and three days before she was reported missing, witnesses saw her arguing with Cormier in the street and heard Cormier mention something about a river. Holland testified that she heard Tina tell Cormier she was going to call the cops. The Crown argued that Cormier was worried that Tina was going to report that he had stolen a truck. Court heard an audio recording of Tina calling 911 to report a stolen truck. Witnesses also testified that Tina was angry that Cormier had sold her bike for drugs. Cormier acknowledged the argument in an interview with police and said he followed her down the street before turning in the other direction. He said that is the last time he saw her. He also suggested the suspect police should really be looking for was a man who looked like singer Robert Plant who was walking in the same direction as Tina that night. \u201cDon\u2019t focus on me,\u201d he told police.\n\u2014\nERNIE DeWOLFE\nDeWolfe met Cormier in prison and they stayed at the same halfway house for a time.\u00a0 DeWolfe testified he talked to Cormier on Aug. 15 and Cormier said he had met with Tina the previous day to ensure she was not going to call the police.\u00a0 \u201cHe just said that he had talked to her and he straightened it all out and took care of it,\u201d DeWolfe testified. \u201cI just presumed that he talked to her and \u2026 sorted it out.\u201d Tina\u2019s body was found in the river on Aug. 17. In cross-examination, the defence suggested DeWolfe made the whole story up because he and Cormier had had an argument over money.\n\u2014\nTHE UNDERCOVER TAPES\nPolice launched a six-month undercover operation against Cormier called Project Styx. Cormier was placed in a bugged apartment for free and an undercover officer moved into a suite on the same floor.\nCormier was recorded saying he\u2019d bet the girl was killed because he found out she was only 15 years old. \u201cI drew the line and that\u2019s why she got killed,\u201d he said. Cormier also told a woman that when he last talked to Tina, he told her to go jump off a bridge. At another point, he asked a woman if she had ever been \u201chaunted by something\u201d before he started to talk about Tina and boast that he beat two murders. During another recording, Cormier said during an argument with a woman that there was a little girl in a \u201cgrave someplace screaming at the top of her lungs for me to finish the job. And guess what? I finished the job.\u201d Court also heard Cormier in a recording warning people in his apartment not to overdose or they would end up wrapped in a carpet and thrown in the river.\u00a0 In conversations with the undercover officer, Cormier said there were \u201cthree rules to crime: deny, deny deny.\u201d\n\u2014\nTHE ARGUMENTS\n\u00a0\nCrown prosecutors contended that Cormier killed Tina, either by suffocation or drowning, because he found out she was only 15 and that would make him a pedophile. They said Cormier\u2019s own words on the undercover tapes should be enough to convict him. The defence said that with no DNA evidence and no cause of death, there were too many holes in the case. It argued that Cormier felt guilt after learning that Tina was only 15 and he wanted to find the real killer.\n\u2014\n\u00a0\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

Then it was justified; now it is not. Then it accurately described the actions of the state; now it seems designed to provoke Canadians rather than prod them to address a serious matter.In 2015, with the release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s landmark report, then Supreme Court chief justice\u00a0Beverley\u00a0McLachlin said that Canada attempted to commit \u201ccultural genocide\u201d against Aboriginal peoples. Since the arrival of settlers, she said,\u00a0Canada developed an \u201cethos of exclusion and cultural annihilation.\u201dCommission chair Murray Sinclair agreed, particularly as it applied to \u201cforcibly removing children from their families and placing them within\u00a0institutions\u00a0(residential schools) that were cultural indoctrination centres.\u201d\"I think as commissioners\u00a0we have concluded that cultural genocide is probably the best description of what went on here,\u201d Sinclair said.\u00a0\u201cBut more importantly, if anybody tried to do this today, they would easily be subject to prosecution\u201d under the 1948 United Nations Convention on Genocide, which defined it as \u201cacts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\u201dAre we trying to do this today? Is Canada committing genocide against its Indigenous population? \u00a0The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls thinks so, repeatedly using the term genocide in its final report released Monday. It is a brutal read, particularly the emotional testimony of family members who lost mothers and daughters in the many cases that remain unsolved, preventing the sense of closure so necessary in any culture.According to the report there exists \u201ca race-based genocide of Indigenous Peoples . . . empowered by colonial structures . . . leading directly to the current increased rates of violence, death, and suicide in Indigenous populations.\u201dWhile it is true that, in the case of MMIWG, some police in the past did not treat some cases seriously, and some Canadians didn\u2019t much care, the tide has certainly changed. There has been an explosion of public concern about the state of many Indigenous populations based on a new level of understanding of their situations. The rising number of Indigenous stories in the news media alone tells us that Canadians are taking their collective responsibility seriously and, in their comments, seeking and approving measures to make things better.For example, if there is one thing that riles people it is the persistence of unclean drinking water on First Nations. The federal government has committed to end all such advisories by 2021, a pledge for which it receives not enough credit and too much uninformed criticism.For the record, 85 long-term drinking water advisories have been lifted since the pledge was made in 2015 with 58 remaining.Unfortunately, many such improvements are temporary. Earlier this year, all 11 advisories at Slate Falls First Nation\u2019s pump houses were lifted in what was deemed a major success. Seventeen days later an advisory was back on. A memo to then Indigenous Services minister Jane Philpott obtained through access-to-information legislation showed that Slate Falls\u2019 water operators weren\u2019t testing the water in the weeks after the plant opened, and there was little oversight to ensure the water was being monitored properly.The department acknowledged that (despite the federal commitment and the inherent employment opportunities) \u201cmany First Nations across Canada experience challenges monitoring, operating and maintaining water systems.\u201dThis is the crux of much of what still ails relations between First Nations, that demand autonomy, and governments, that provide resources and then respectfully step back.In the case of MMIWG, it is a step too far \u2013 by far \u2013 to accuse Canada and Canadians of collective responsibility \u2013 of genocide -- in what is certainly a national tragedy.\u201cWe cannot pretend to be a country that cares about human rights, that has a positive impact on the world, if we do not end this situation once and for all,\u201d\u00a0said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, speaking for most Canadians. Unfortunately, after initially avoiding it, he agreed the matter amounts to genocide.\n\n\n\n\nThough the murder or disappearance of at least 1,200 Indigenous women and girls is horrible, the crimes were not \u201ccommitted with intent to destroy, in whole or in part\u201d a particular racial or ethnic group by the state or by Canadians collectively.Instead we have another brutal truth, one that was essentially ignored by the inquiry: the murder of Aboriginal females is largely confined to the Indigenous community.As outlined by\u00a0Hymie Rubenstein, retired professor of anthropology at the University of Manitoba\u00a0in the National Post this week,\u00a0RCMP and other statistics reveal that 90 per cent of these murders are committed by Indigenous men who knew their victims; 72 per cent of Aboriginal women are murdered mainly in their homes; very few women involved in the sex trade, whether Indigenous or not, are murdered by their clients; and there is no significant difference between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal homicide victims in the sex trade.But Marion Buller, the inquiry\u2019s chief commissioner, insists that these cases amount to an ongoing \u201cdeliberate, race, identity and gender-based genocide\u201d in and by Canada.If the commissioners\u2019 goal was to gain headlines, mission accomplished. If the intent was to provoke, to \u201cstimulate or incite (someone) to do or feel something, especially by arousing anger in them,\u201d they\u2019ve succeeded.But what has this hyperbole done except divert attention from the important goal of ending danger to Indigenous women and girls, not to mention \u2013 and they didn\u2019t \u2013 Indigenous men who\u00a0represent at least 70 per cent of murdered or missing Aboriginal persons?Since mitigating the crime is indeed the goal accepted by most Canadians, why did the commissioners ignore most guilty parties \u2013 Indigenous men -- and instead lay the blame on the Canadian people as a whole?It would be another national tragedy if the commission\u2019s misplaced priorities served to hurt the important tasks ahead, beginning with increased police presence at what is so often the scene of the crime \u2013 Canada\u2019s First Nations.Ian Pattison is retired as editorial page editor of The Chronicle-Journal, but still shares his thoughts on current affairs.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nGenocide\n \nCanada\n \nMurder\n \nCrime\n \nCriminal Law\n \nPolice\n \nCanadian\n \nInquiry\n \n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                Recommended for you\n                \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                Submit a Letter to the Editor\n                \n                    \n\n\nIf you're interested in submitting a Letter to the Editor, click here.\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                Submit Your News\n                \n                    \n\n\nWe're always interested in hearing about news in our community.

Valcourt said during the meeting that the statistic came from the RCMP, but it had not been made public.\nTreaty 6 Grand Chief Bernice Martial demanded Valcourt release the source of his information.\nWhen asked by APTN where Valcourt obtained his information, RCMP spokesperson Sgt. Harold Pfleiderer suggested the minister\u2019s office was best positioned to answer that question.\n\u201cI invite you to contact Minister Valcourt\u2019s office,\u201d said Pfleiderer.\nThe minister\u2019s office did not return a request for comment as of this article\u2019s posting.\nNDP Aboriginal affairs critic Niki Ashton pressed Valcourt to release the source of his information during question period Wednesday, but the minister avoided providing a direct answer.\nThe RCMP statement said the main focus of its public release last May was the \u201cAboriginal origin of female victims of homicides.\u201d\nThe statement said the RCMP was more interested in the \u201cvictim-perpetrator relationship.\u201d Its review found that in 62 per cent of Indigenous women murders, the perpetrators were either a spouse, 29 per cent, a family member, 23 per cent, or an intimate partner, 10 per cent. Thirty per cent of the murders were committed by an acquaintance and eight per cent of murders were committed by a stranger.\nThe RCMP reviewed cases of murdered and missing Indigenous women which were held by about 200 police departments across the country dating back to 1980. The RCMP released some information from the review in a report last year that said there were 1,181 murdered and missing Indigenous women cases across the country.\n\u201cThese statistics have enabled focused prevention/intervention efforts, guiding and informing future crime prevention and reduction efforts as it relates to family violence in vulnerable communities across the country,\u201d said the statement.\nDuring the Nation to Nation taping of the political panel, Ashton said the Conservatives were \u201crace baiting\u201d with the 70 per cent statistic.\n\u201cThey are absolving themselves from any blame or any responsibility on this issue,\u201d said Ashton.\nLabrador Liberal MP Yvonne Jones said Valcourt should have publicly released the information before raising it during a private meeting.\n\u201cWho the perpetrator is does not change the fact that the government has a responsibility to do an inquiry and get to the bottom of it,\u201d said Jones, during the Nation to Nation political panel.\nSaskatchewan Senator Lillian Dyck issued a statement saying Valcourt \u201cmust show us this unreported data because they contradict other reported facts.\u201d\nDyck said the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada\u2019s (NWAC) own research found that only 36 per cent of cases were linked to Indigenous men. She said NWAC\u2019s numbers showed that in 41 per cent of cases the racial identity of the perpetrator was unknown.\njbarrera@aptn.ca\n@JorgeBarrera\n\n\nTags: Aboriginal Affairs Minister Bernard Valcourt, Conservative MP Rob Clarke, Featured, Liberal MP Yvonne Jones, MMWI, Murdered and Missing Indigenous women, NDP MP Niki Ashton, RCMP\n\n\n\nJorge Barrera\n\t\t\t\t\tOttawa Bureau\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tView all posts by Jorge Barrera \u2192 \n\n\n\n\n\u2018I never hit him upstairs, I didn\u2019t hit him\u2019\nInFocus: stopping suicide in Maskwacis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChet Lund\n\n\n\nSo political correctness wins over the truth and evidence again ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmayow\n\n\n\nHe was asked for some truth and evidence, he couldn\u2019t provide it\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDean Cromarty\n\n\n\nTo me, murder is murder.

A special gathering of chiefs hosted by the Assembly of First Nations approved a resolution calling for the federal government to reset the inquiry by replacing the chief commissioner, Marion Buller. It also suggested a new head should be named through a process of full engagement with Indigenous survivors and families.

Information was also provided by B.C.\u2019s integrated homicide investigation team, which includes members from the RCMP and municipal forces.\nIn addition, the RCMP\u2019s sensitive and specialized investigative services reported 642 hours \u2014 about 16 weeks \u2014 spent supporting investigations into missing Indigenous child and adult females. It did not include a dollar amount. \nThe divisions that did provide a cost summary only included additional expenses, such as travel and overtime, but not regular salaries, which are not tracked, many divisions noted. \n\u201cAs indicated, this is not indicative of the total number of person hours dedicated to these investigations,\u201d an email from Alberta RCMP\u2019s serious crimes branch said. \u201cThis is not information which is tracked.\u201d\nNo information was provided by RCMP divisions in Ontario and Quebec, which also have their own provincial police forces. \nIn addition, divisions in the Northwest Territories, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, provinces that rely on RCMP for provincial policing, did not provide a response. \nThe divisions that did respond showed expenses that ranged from just over $65,000 in the Yukon to $1.25 million in Alberta for things like \u201covertime, travel, covert investigations, and assistance from other police forces.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nNunavut declined to provide a cost estimate at all.  \n\u201cWe have no way of tracking the exact costs of these files and there is no system that I am aware of that monitors this either,\u201d Cpl. Erik Lieng said in his response to the RCMP\u2019s access to information and privacy branch. \n\u201cI can say that during that time period we had two files meeting the below request,\u201d Lieng added. \nMost divisions that provided a response showed similar case numbers. \nBoth the Yukon and Newfoundland and Labrador said they had investigated two cases during the time period; Saskatchewan reported six; the combined total for B.C.\u2019s major crimes unit and integrated homicide investigations team was six; Nova Scotia revealed one case under investigation during the time period, a homicide.\nManitoba and Alberta revealed significantly higher case numbers, at 36 and 23 cases, respectively. \nLorraine Whitman, president of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada,\u00a0said those numbers don\u2019t mesh with the hundreds of families who shared their stories during the national inquiry and hundreds more who felt too traumatized to testify. \n\u201cThere\u2019s hundreds, and even into the thousands. We do not have a proper database that\u2019s been given to us,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHow many have been moved on to cold files? We don\u2019t know.\u201d\nIn a 2015 update, the RCMP reported 204 unsolved homicides and missing persons cases amongst Indigenous women in Canada. \nWhitman, who is based in Nova Scotia, said that province\u2019s single case is likely Cassidy Bernard, a young mother from the\u00a0We'koqma'q First Nation who was found dead in her home in October 2018. The high-profile nature of the case and pressure from the community resulted in an arrest in 2019, she said. \nManitoba and Alberta, provinces that stood out as reporting higher-than-average case numbers, both have RCMP units dedicated to murdered and missing persons. \nGordon said the discrepancy is \u201cprobably a counting issue\u201d between distinct divisions. \n\u201cIn the absence of national co-ordination, there are going to be errors, and they can be fatal to any attempt to come up with a national picture,\u201d he said. \nGordon said lack of a co-ordinated approach and national data limits police effectiveness in dealing with the cases. He pointed to the investigation into the disappearance of women from Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside two decades ago as a case study in how multi-jurisdictional policing can hamper investigations.\nIn 2001, the RCMP established Project Evenhanded to oversee investigations into the disappearances, which overlapped RCMP and Vancouver Police Department jurisdictions. Robert Pickton was arrested \u2014 and later convicted \u2014 in the deaths of six women the following year. He had been killing women for at least five years by then.\n\u201cThere was no co-ordination of effort until they realized that there was a serial killer at work,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cThen they decided that they should have been a more co-ordinated investigation.\u201d\nProject Evenhanded has since been disbanded, but a 2012 inquiry outlined \u201ccritical police failures\u201d during the Downtown Eastside disappearances, including \u201cfailure to address cross-jurisdictional issues and ineffective co-ordination between police forces and agencies.\u201d In the report, commissioner Wally Oppal credited Project Evenhanded with improving communication between multiple branches of the RCMP and the Vancouver Police Department. \nThe report notes that criminal activity can be obscured by jurisdictional boundaries, which create gaps in law enforcement and investigations. \n\u201cThere is no question that this was true in the missing women investigations, and the challenge to apprehend was exacerbated by poor communication and co-ordination between police forces and agencies involved in the investigations,\u201d the report states. \n\u201cThe missing women investigations failed, in large part, because the approach was always one of multiple investigations. No one was in charge of the case as a whole.\u201d \nIn an emailed response to The Tyee, the RCMP\u2019s national headquarters said the force has begun to make changes to policies, procedures and training to address the issue of murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls. \nIt pointed to $9.6 million received over five years, beginning in 2019, to support the National Office of Investigative Standards and Practices, which \u201cacts as an internal RCMP centre of expertise and provides national oversight for high profile/major case investigations.\u201d\u00a0\nThe national unit will not be specific to murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls, it said, but will provide \u201cadvice, guidance and national oversight\u201d to investigations, including those related to violence against Indigenous women. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Does the RCMP Spend on Investigating Missing Indigenous Women? A Tyee Inquiry Remains Unanswered\n\tread more \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBy setting national standards and providing advanced investigative training, the NOISP will benefit all major case investigations \u2014 including cases of missing or murdered Indigenous women and girls,\u201d the email said. \n\u201cAs Indigenous females and other vulnerable persons are overrepresented as victims of high profile and major crimes, a significant proportion of the investigative support work of the NOISP will focus on cases involving Indigenous and vulnerable victims of crime in RCMP jurisdictions.\u201d\nAn email from the office of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness also pointed to NOISP as \u201can integral tool in the governance, oversight, co-ordination and application of sound major case management principles to high-risk investigations\u201d involving missing and murdered Indigenous women. \n\u201cReconciliation is a crucial priority for our government and we are working tirelessly to renew our relationship with Indigenous peoples based on the recognition of rights, respect and co-operation,\u201d press secretary\u00a0Mary-Liz Power said.  \n\u201cWe know that there is work left to do, and that we need to do better.\u201d\nIn addition, the RCMP is contributing to the federal government\u2019s National Action Plan, which it said is aimed at addressing violence against Indigenous women, girls, Two Spirit and LGBTQQIA+ people. \nAn email from the office of the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations said the National Action Plan is a priority for the federal government. It will include contributions from all levels of government, including provincial, territorial, municipal and Indigenous, with the first part released by the Yukon government in December. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Army\u2019 of RCMP to Protect Pipeline, but No Answers on Indigenous Woman\u2019s Death\n\tread more \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe resulting distinctions-based National Action Plan will be rooted in, and will address the unique needs, experiences, and cultural contexts of, Indigenous peoples and communities,\u201d the email said. \nIt did not provide an estimated completion date for the plan. \nGordon said that while it\u2019s easy to identify the crisis in hindsight, national institutions like the RCMP take some time to pivot toward a response. \n\u201cI think what it does is to amplify the problems involved with the organization of police in this country,\u201d he said, adding that Canada\u2019s national police force also takes on contracts that range from municipal to international policing. \u201cThis complicates the picture beyond belief.\u201d\nWhitman added that the disappearance of unknown numbers of missing and murdered Indigenous women constitutes more than a crisis. \n\u201cIt\u2019s genocide,\u201d she said.  \nGovernments and institutions need to recognize that, she added. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to change until we acknowledge the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all know it exists.

The inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women says Poitras has resigned as a commissioner. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Fred Chartrand\n\nCOMMISSIONER QUITS INDIGENOUS WOMEN INQUIRY: A commissioner on the inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women has announced she will resign at the end of this week \u2014 a departure that raises new questions among advocates about how much faith they can put in the much-anticipated process. Marilyn Poitras, one of five commissioners named by the Liberal government last summer to examine the root causes of violence against Indigenous women and girls, explained her decision in a letter to Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. \"It is clear to me that I am unable to perform my duties as a commissioner with the process designed in its current structure,\" the letter said, noting she will step aside as of July 15. Poitras' resignation comes shortly after the departure of the commission's executive director, Michele Moreau, and is further evidence \"the whole inquiry is in jeopardy,\" said Sheila North Wilson, a grand chief of an organization representing First Nations in northern Manitoba.\u2014\u2014\u2014TRUMP JR. TOLD IN EMAIL OF RUSSIAN EFFORT TO AID CAMPAIGN: Donald Trump Jr. eagerly accepted help from what was described to him as a Russian government effort to aid his father's campaign with damaging information about Hillary Clinton, emails he released publicly Tuesday say. The email exchange posted to Twitter by Donald Trump's eldest son represents the clearest sign to date that members of the president's inner circle were willing to meet during the campaign with Russians who wanted Trump to prevail. U.S. intelligence agencies have said the Russian government meddled in the election through hacking to aid Trump. The emails show Trump Jr. conversing with a music publicist who wanted him to meet with a lawyer from Moscow. The publicist describes the lawyer as a \"Russian government attorney\" who has dirt on Clinton as \"part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump.\" In one response, Trump Jr. says, \"I love it.\" The messages were the latest disclosure to roil the ongoing investigation into Russia's interference in the election and potential collusion with Trump's campaign.\u2014\u2014\u2014EX-GITMO DETAINEE PRAISES CANADA'S KHADR DEAL: A British man compensated by the U.K. government for his torture and years of detention at Guantanamo Bay expressed dismay Tuesday at the public and political furor in Canada over Ottawa's settlement with Omar Khadr. Speaking from his home in Birmingham in the U.K., Moazzam Begg said Canadians instead should be proud of the federal government for the payment and apology to Khadr for breaching his rights. \"The nation shouldn't be upset about issuing an apology for something that's right,\" Begg told The Canadian Press. \"If people are getting upset about that, I think they need to revisit what their morals and values are about.\" Begg is one of 16 former Guantanamo detainees who settled lawsuits against the British government in 2010. The deal, while decried by some, aroused little of the anger seen in Canada over the Khadr settlement, announced last week, which sources said was worth $10.5 million. Now 49, Begg was kidnapped in Pakistan where he was living in early 2002, and turned over to American forces. They imprisoned him at Bagram in Afghanistan, where a horribly wounded 15-year-old Khadr was taken after U.S. soldiers captured him in July of that year.\u2014\u2014\u2014WILDFIRE SITUATION DETERIORATING, B.C. OFFICIAL SAYS: British Columbia officials are bracing for a lengthy wildfire season as hundreds of blazes burn across the province with no reprieve in sight. About 14,000 people have been displaced by more than 200 wildfires and Bob Turner of Emergency Management B.C. said the situation is still deteriorating. The Cariboo Regional District expanded an evacuation order on Monday night to cover the Alexis Creek and West Fraser areas in addition to the Kleena Kleene region. An evacuation alert \u2014 which puts residents on notice that they may have to leave with little warning \u2014 was issued for the more than 10,000 residents of Williams Lake Monday night. Municipal officials warned that wind and lightning forecast for Wednesday could push fires toward the city at a \"rapid pace.\" The Tsilhqot'in Nation, which encompasses six communities near Williams Lake, said four of its communities are threatened. The fires, which have scorched about 400 square kilometres of land, are being fought by some 1,000 B.C. firefighters, with about 300 colleagues and support staff arriving from Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and New Brunswick.\u2014\u2014\u2014FISHERMAN DIES AFTER FREEING ENTANGLED WHALE: A lobster fisherman with a passion for freeing whales from deadly fishing line was killed soon after he cut the last piece of rope from a massive whale in the waters off eastern New Brunswick, friends and colleagues confirmed Tuesday. They say Joe Howlett had helped rescue about two dozen whales over the last 15 years. Mackie Green of the Campobello Whale Rescue Team said Howlett had boarded a federal Fisheries Department vessel off Shippagan on Monday to help a North Atlantic right whale that had become entangled in a heavy snarl of rope. Green was not on the boat, but said he was told the 59-year-old veteran fisherman was hit by the whale just after it was cut free and started swimming away. \"They got the whale totally disentangled and then some kind of freak thing happened and the whale made a big flip,\" said Green, who started the rescue team with Howlett in 2002 and had worked closely with him ever since.\u2014\u2014\u2014BIBEAU TO PRESS U.S. TO PRESERVE AID BUDGET: International Development Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau says she will try to persuade her counterpart in the Trump administration not to slash billions in foreign aid as the president has proposed. Bibeau she will make the case for continued spending, including for family planning and abortion, when the new head of the U.S. Agency for International Development is finally hired. The USAID chief is one of many vacant Trump administration positions, but former Tanzanian ambassador Mark Green has been nominated. U.S. President Donald Trump has said he will cut the State Department and USAID budgets by 31 per cent in 2018. Trump has also reinstated a ban on funding abortion-related activities by foreign aid that was first started by the Reagan Republicans in 1984. Bibeau says the government is steadfastly committed to funding family planning as she announced how $241 million of a previous $650 million commitment would be spent.\u2014\u2014\u2014FIRST FEMALE JAG SAYS ARRIVAL SENDS A MESSAGE: The new head of Canada's military justice system says her appointment shows the Forces are serious about accepting and valuing women in uniform. Commodore Genevieve Bernatchez is the Canadian Armed Forces' first female judge advocate general, or JAG. She takes over as senior leaders have been pushing for the military to add more women in uniform and within the senior ranks. The military justice system is also in the midst of its first full review in decades, in part due to complaints about how the system has handled sexual misconduct in the ranks. Bernatchez says there's no denying she will bring a different perspective and approach to military justice than her male predecessors. But she says she's reserving judgment on exactly what needs to change until the review is completed later this summer.\u2014\u2014\u2014CLOSE CALL FOR AIR CANADA PLANE IN SAN FRANCISCO: Investigators looking into what caused an apparent close call involving an Air Canada flight at San Francisco International Airport are expected to examine whether human error or controller procedures played a role in the incident, an aviation expert said Tuesday. The state of the aircraft's and controller's equipment, and the design of the air space will also be under review as officials try to determine how a flight from Toronto came to line up with a taxiway rather than the runway as it prepared to land, said Barry Wiszniowski, president of Aviation Safety Management Experts. An Air Canada Airbus A320 was cleared to land on one of the runways at the San Francisco airport just before midnight on Friday when the pilot \"inadvertently\" lined up with the taxiway, which runs parallel to the runway, the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority said. There were four aircraft lined up on the taxiway waiting for departure when the incident occurred, the FAA said in a statement. The Air Canada plane eventually made another approach and landed without incident, it said. Air Canada said 135 passengers and five crew members were aboard its plane, but gave little other information, citing its own ongoing investigation.\u2014\u2014\u2014HALIFAX MAYOR URGES CALM ON CORNWALLIS STATUE: The mayor of Halifax is speaking out against a plan circulating on social media to forcibly remove a statue of Edward Cornwallis from a downtown park that bears the name of the city's contentious founder. Mike Savage issued a statement Tuesday saying any action to remove the statue is not condoned by the Nova Scotia Assembly of Mi'kmaq Chiefs. The mayor says he understand that many Indigenous people and others disagree with the continued presence of Cornwallis on a pedestal in a public park. Cornwallis and his military council issued an infamous scalping proclamation in 1749 promising a bounty for the scalp of every Mi'kmaq. Savage says he is committed to a resolution of the polarizing situation and notes that city council has asked a panel to make recommendations, including potentially removing the statue and renaming the park. A Facebook event called \"Removing Cornwallis\" invites people to a protest Saturday, and to \"peacefully remove\" the statue.\u2014\u2014\u2014RESCUE DOG FOUND AFTER ESCAPE AT AIRPORT: The new owner of a rescue dog that went missing after being let out of a crate at Canada's busiest airport said he's relieved his pet was found before any harm came to the animal. Jordan Wong said he and his family were anxious throughout the hours-long hunt for Emily, a 4.5-kilogram dog that had been brought to Canada from Greece as part of a rescue effort. Emily had been on Canadian soil for barely an hour when customs officials allegedly opened her crate to give her a walk on Monday. At that point, Emily bolted and raced across the highway near Toronto's Pearson International Airport, according to Stray Paws from Greece, the rescue group that co-ordinated her adoption. Wong said he and his family waited at the airport for eight hours while searchers scoured the area for Emily, but eventually had to go home without the pet they'd been eagerly awaiting for the past three weeks. On Tuesday morning, however, a Toronto woman found the dog and brought her to a local veterinary clinic where the pup was eventually identified. Stray Paws could not immediately be reached for comment but alleged in a Facebook post that Emily was lost while being processed through customs in Toronto.\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAdvertise With Us\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Error\nSubmit a Tip\nRefundRefund\n\n\n\nThe Brandon Sun is not accepting comments on this story.\nWhy aren't comments accepted on this story?

Chip in to keep stories like these coming.\nThe Walking With Our Sisters art installation is currently in Ottawa and will visit numerous other communities through to March 2019.\nAs noted on their website, \"Walking With Our Sisters is by all accounts a massive commemorative art installation comprised of 1,763+ pairs of moccasin vamps (tops) plus 108 pairs of children's vamps created and donated by hundreds of caring and concerned individuals to draw attention to [the injustice of missing and murdered Indigenous women and residential schools]. ...The work exists as a floor installation made up of beaded vamps arranged in a winding path formation on fabric and includes cedar boughs. Viewers remove their shoes to walk on a path of cloth alongside the vamps.\"\n\"Each pair of vamps (or 'uppers' as they are also called) represents one missing or murdered Indigenous woman. The unfinished moccasins represent the unfinished lives of the women whose lives were cut short. The children's vamps are dedicated to children who never returned home from residential schools. Together the installation represents all these women; paying respect to their lives and existence on this earth. They are not forgotten. They are sisters, mothers, aunties, daughters, cousins, grandmothers, wives and partners. They have been cared for, they have been loved, they are missing and they are not forgotten.\"\nIn terms of the story behind this project, the Globe and Mail has reported, \"In July, 2012, Christi Belcourt, a Michif (M\u00e9tis) artist who lives near Sudbury, made a Facebook appeal for help with a year-long collaborative art project called Walking With Our Sisters... She hoped to assemble a show of 600 pairs of hand-made moccasin vamps (uppers) -- but by year's end had received 1,723 pairs, from artists and craftspeople all over North America and beyond. Sixty-five new beading circles sprang up around the project, and many people learned traditional crafts to participate -- 'a beautiful side-effect', says Ms. Belcourt.\"\nThe art installation will be at Carleton University in Ottawa through to October 16. It then goes to Akwesasne Mohawk Territory (November 6-26). In 2016, the exhibit will be in North Battleford, Saskatchewan (January 15-February 7), The Pas, Manitoba (March 1-11), Mt. Pleasant, Michigan (April 23-June 3), Almonte, Ontario (August 10-September 17), Manitowaning, Ontario (October-November), and Halifax (December 5-February 5, 2017). For a complete listing of where it will be between 2017 and 2019 before it concludes in Kenora, Ontario, please click here. The Council of Canadians has repeatedly called on the Harper government to support a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women. Indigenous women make up 4.3 per cent of the Canadian population, but they account for 16 per cent of murdered women and 11.3 per cent of missing women in Canada. Over the past 30 years, 1,026 Indigenous women have been murdered and 160 are missing. We also support the recommendations made by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to address the damage inflicted on Indigenous peoples by the Indian Residential School System. It has been estimated that about 150,000 children were forced into these schools and that up to 6,000 of them died there. \n\n\n\nThe Walking With Our Sisters art installation is a poignant reminder of the need for an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women as well as the full implementation of all 94 recommendations made by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. If the Walking With Our Sisters art installation comes to your community, please be sure to visit it.\nLike this article? rabble is reader-supported journalism.

How the U.S. is moving to address itMoves by the United States Justice Department follow years of headlines in Canada.By Jamin MikeStaff ReporterSat., July 1, 2023timer3 min. readThe U.S. Justice Department is launching a program to  respond to the missing and murdered Indigenous persons crisis \u2014 an issue that\u2019s been getting attention south of the border, following years of headlines in Canada.Five assistant U.S. attorneys and five co-ordinators will be given the mandate to support United States attorneys\u2019 offices in addressing the issue. The personnel will be situated in 10 states covering five regions across the country.\u201cThe five AUSAs will have the same authorities as other AUSAs and will partner with federal (Bureau of Indian Affairs Missing and Murdered Unit and FBI), tribal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to assist in investigating unresolved cases,\u201d a U.S. Justice Department spokesperson said.In August 2017, when the body of a missing and pregnant 22-year-old Indigenous woman, Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, was found in duct tape and plastic in the Red River, the Native American community of North Dakota was shaken. It was the same river, though divided by an international border, where 15-year-old Tina Fontaine was found dead in Winnipeg in 2014.After pressure and advocacy with the hope of preventing similar tragedies, Savanna\u2019s Act was signed, among a number of measures introduced by the U.S. government, directing the Department of Justice to review protocols regarding missing or murdered Native Americans.In November 2021, President Joe Biden signed the Executive Order on Improving Public Safety and Criminal Justice for Native Americans and Addressing the Crisis of Missing or Murdered Indigenous People. The order instructs varying levels of government departments to collaborate on making Native Americans feel safer, assist in getting them justice, and to find solutions to the crisis.Last July, deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco directed U.S. attorneys and law enforcement \u201cto update and develop new plans for promoting public safety in Indian country.\u201d The directive includes co-ordinating with law enforcement officers and federal agencies, supporting victims and others impacted in a \u201cvictim-centred and culturally appropriate manner,\u201d as well as addressing active and unresolved cases involving missing or murdered Indigenous people.This new Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons Outreach Program is an attempt to align with Monaco\u2019s directive to dedicate new personnel to the issue.Natalie Bullion, executive director of MMIW USA, said she\u2019s pleased to hear of the new program and that someone is taking on the work. But she remains cautious.\u201cMy expectations are not actually super-high, and we are very used to some of this stuff not actually making a tangible difference,\u201d she told the Star.Bullion worries Native Americans who are not federally recognized may fall through the cracks of the new outreach program. \u201cIf someone is legally Native American, the jurisdiction over their case and the resources available in their case from law enforcement and other sources are going to be different from those who are not legally Native American, regardless of whether they are Indigenous or not.\u201dShe wants to see more people working to educate others on missing and murdered Indigenous people, and in a way the program is doing just that. But she also wants \u201cnew eyes\u201d looking over old cases, and new attorneys looking at cases failed by the criminal justice system.RELATED STORIESCanadaWhat\u2019s Blue Jean Jacket Day?

Here\u2019s what gave this chief hopeApr. 21, 2023Despite her criticism, Bullion said the program can still help. \u201cThe courts and criminal justice system in this nation are the means by which we will be able to get justice, so attorneys dedicated to this issue certainly will play a role in that.\u201dIn Canada, the final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, was released in 2019 and delivered 231 individual calls for justice.\u201cObtaining the national inquiry and the movement that gained so much momentum to get to that point is what built the movement,\u201d Bullion said, adding that the term Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women was coined by \u201cwomen warriors\u201d in the north.U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement that \u201cThis new program mobilizes the Justice Department\u2019s resources to combat the crisis of Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons, which has shattered the lives of victims, their families, and entire Tribal communities.\u201dJamin Mike is a Toronto-based staff reporter for the Star.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO - Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench *MANDATORY CREDIT*WINNIPEG - The trial of a man accused of killing a 15-year-old Indigenous girl in Winnipeg has heard more testimony about a duvet cover that was wrapped around the girl when she was found.Raymond Cormier has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder in the death of Tina Fontaine, whose body was pulled from the Red River in August 2014.The trial heard from two women last week who said the duvet cover looked the same as one that Cormier used while living in a tent in their backyard.One of the women said she had seen two cigarette burn marks in the cover Cormier had.The trial heard today from Winnipeg police Const. Garrett Carrette, who brought the duvet cover Tina's body was discovered in to court and showed the jury two holes in it.Under cross-examination, Carrette agreed with Cormier's lawyer that the holes looked like rips or tears in the fabric.Tina died shortly after moving from the Sagkeeng First Nation to Winnipeg to visit her mother.She became a sexually exploited youth and was missing for days before her body was found.\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAdvertise With Us\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Error\nSubmit a Tip\nRefundRefund\n\n\n\nThe Brandon Sun is not accepting comments on this story.\nWhy aren't comments accepted on this story?

than five decades ago.Tootsie Jimmy-Charlie, a 26-year-old Kaska member of the Liard First Nation and a mother of four, went missing in 1967.Several weeks after loved ones expected her to return home from Whitehorse, RCMP informed them that her body had been discovered at a dump in the city.On Friday, Yukon RCMP apologized to friends and relatives of Jimmy-Charlie at the Kwanlin Dun Cultural Centre in Whitehorse for failing to properly investigate her death.Jimmy-Charlie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s younger sister Anne Maje Raider, who attended the apology, said her family had mixed emotions, including relief and anger that it had taken so long.Maje Raider said she is hopeful the RCMP's commitment to change and improve its relationship with Indigenous people means something like this won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen again.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all that we can pray for now \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that Indigenous women aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t treated with racism and the RCMP respond immediately and do the search immediately,\" said Maje Raider, who was 16 when her sister died.Maje Raider said she remembers her sister, who was one of 14 children, as a loving mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe was very compassionate and caring and she adored her children,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe was always very slow putting on her makeup. One thing we always joke about was how she loves to put on makeup and take her time.\u00e2\u0080\u009dChief Supt. Scott Sheppard, commanding officer for the Yukon RCMP, said it was the police force's job to complete a thorough investigation \"and that was not done\"\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour experience was not up to the standards of our policies and procedures today, and we were not the police service you needed and deserved.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement ahead of the apology, Jimmy-Charlie's family said the police investigation into her death was inadequate and the coroner's report displayed prejudice against Indigenous people.That report described the discovery of her remains as \"uneventful\" and determined her death was the result of \"misadventure\" with alcohol and exposure playing a prominent role. The family is asking that the \"racism embedded in the report\" be removed.\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo this day, the dump in Whitehorse remains far from everything. Their report makes it sound like she just walked there herself and died on a pile of garbage. No one does that. No one,\" Jimmy-Charlie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter, Darlene Jimmy, wrote in the statement.The RCMP apology comes after several members of Jimmy-Charlie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family publicly spoke about her death and how it was handled by police during the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in 2017 and 2018.The RCMP said it reviewed the case after a public complaint in 2019, and determined they had failed to conduct a thorough investigation, to keep the family informed or to advise them of the cause of Jimmy-Charlie's death.Police said their investigation remains open and they are asking the public for any information.In addition to the RCMP apology, Maje Raider said her family wants an apology for the coroner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s report, and from the federal government for policies they believe led to Jimmy-Charlie's death.Under the Indian Act at the time, it was illegal for Indigenous people to purchase or consume alcohol and they weren't allowed to hire legal representation.Jimmy-Charlie's family said she was taken to a jail in Whitehorse for either consuming or possessing alcohol.They said her family expected her to return home by bus when she was released, but she never arrived.This report by The Canadian Press was first published on Aug. 10, 2022This story was produced with the financial assistance of the Meta and Canadian Press News Fellowship.\n\n\nThe Canadian Press.

A note of gratitude from our team.\n\n\n\n In the weeks since the Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc First Nation announced it had found the remains of 215 children at what was once Canada\u2019s largest residential school in Kamloops, an opportunity to reconcile a painful past, a troubling present and a hopeful future might be emerging.\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission had previously confirmed 51 deaths at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, but the Tk\u2019eml\u00faps te Secw\u00e9pemc community had long believed there were many more former students buried in unmarked graves.\nThe discovery of 215 children\u2019s remains using ground-penetrating radar confirmed the horrific truth, and the ensuing grief among Indigenous peoples was public and palpable.\nIn addition to the shock and outrage, and in spite of this deep sorrow, First Nations have courageously responded with compassion and solidarity. Since the grim revelation on May 27, people have travelled from hundreds of kilometres away to Kamloops to support one another and pay homage to the lost children. Honour songs have been sung, prayers said, burnings and smudges offered, tears shed and community connections reaffirmed.\n\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0Tyee\u00a0is\u00a0supported by\u00a0readers\u00a0like\u00a0you\n\n\n\n\n\n Join us and grow independent\u00a0media in\u00a0Canada\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFor non-Indigenous people, something \u2014 finally \u2014 seems to be shifting as well.\nTo a degree that surpasses the public response to the TRC\u2019s work, which wrapped up in December 2015, and the final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, which was presented to the public in June 2019, the story of the 215 children is galvanizing settler society in support of Indigenous peoples as never before.\nMemorials featuring 215 sets of little shoes, candlelight multi-faith prayer gatherings, drumming circles, outpourings of emotion, purchases of orange T-shirts and calls for action are taking place around the world.\nWe now have the opportunity to turn this momentum into transformative action that goes beyond acknowledging these schools were cruel institutions for children removed from the love of their families and subjected to horrific abuse that in any age we would define as criminal. We must recognize that residential schools were designed to contribute to the overarching strategy of alienating Indigenous peoples from their lands and their systems of self-governance.\nThe 215 children in Kamloops \u2014 and the more than 4,100 children who died in residential schools across the country, as identified by the TRC\u2019s Missing Children project \u2014 represent not only the tragedy of kinship loss, but the weight of an economic and political system of colonialism that continues to cause harm to this day.\nUnder Canadian colonialism, Indigenous peoples were \u201ca problem,\u201d because they obstructed settler access to lands and resources. Under British/Canadian law, Indigenous peoples held title and rights to the land. Residential schools became central to settler society\u2019s solution to the \u201cIndian problem\u201d as, in theory, the schools would transform Indigenous rights holders into assimilated ethnic minorities.\nAs this process unfolded and Indigenous peoples were isolated onto reserves, and their ability to manage and control resources were severely curtailed, they came to be stigmatized as a culture defined by social ills: unemployment, poverty, addiction, etc. The circle of colonialism was complete, with the effects of abusive settler policies serving to justify the continued subjugation of Indigenous lands and people.\nActs of resistance\nIt didn\u2019t have to be this way. In the past, Indigenous peoples, along with a few settler allies, did their best to promote alternatives to residential schools, as well as less-colonial ways for settlers and Indigenous peoples to interact.\nWhen B.C. was still a colony of Britain and before Canada\u2019s founding, some Coast Salish leaders decided it would be useful for their children to obtain a western-style education. They wanted to better understand (and resist) the settlers\u2019 efforts to control their land and resources. Most importantly, they sought to create equitable and respectful relationships with the newcomers to their territories \u2014 newcomers they recognized were there to stay.  \nIn the early 1860s, for example, Chief Alexis of Xwch\u00edy\u00f2:m (near Chilliwack) sent one of his daughters to St. Mary\u2019s residential school in Mission, B.C. Two years later, she established a school in her home community where she was the teacher.\nAs far as I know, this was the first Indigenous-run and operated school in B.C. But the government never supported or funded that school. In fact, it worked to undermine the Xwch\u00edy\u00f2:m school when a few years later, government coffers began channeling funding exclusively to residential schools.\nA little more than a decade later, in 1879, both the Nlaka\u2019pamux and St\u00f3:l\u014d leadership along the lower Fraser and Thompson River systems proposed forms of self-governance that included self-funded and/or co-funded day schools. The Chiefs were clear that these schools would be designed to teach their children a western curriculum, but they would also operate on the principle of Indigenous control of Indigenous education. They would supplement studies with traditional land-based learning and activities, and they would allow students to return home each evening. Of course, the federal government rejected these proposals.\n\n\n\n\nBy the 1920s, under the Indian Act, Canadian police were empowered to enforce residential school attendance on Indigenous families who resisted the system. But even then, other options were available and some boldly followed them. In this era a few Indigenous communities established day schools, and in the face of bold requests from Indigenous mothers, a few compassionate teachers and administrators in the provincial system created ways to admit a small number of Indigenous children despite a lack of federal financial support.\nAbuse not limited to residential schools\nIn terms of being on the frontlines of settler colonialism, Indigenous children have always been, and continue to be, the most vulnerable. \nIn the 1790s, would-be Spanish colonists took Nuu-chah-nulth and Coast Salish children to Mexico and placed them in a residential school in Acapulco. Their fates remain unknown.\nIn 1858, during the Fraser River Gold Rush, American miners kidnapped many St\u00f3:l\u014d and Nlaka\u2019pamux boys and brought them to California, where they were exploited for free labour. Miraculously, at least two of them found their way home 30 years later.\nIn 1884, a 14-year-old St\u00f3:l\u014d boy named Louie Sam from the Sema:th (Sumas) community near Abbotsford was framed and arrested for a crime he did not commit  and then lynched by a mob of Americans \u2014 with complicit assistance from Canadians \u2014 on Canadian soil. Justice was never served, and St\u00f3:l\u014d people lived in fear of settler violence when travelling off of their reserves.\nIn more recent times, what is known as the '60s Scoop saw social workers sweep in and apprehend Indigenous youth deemed \u201cat risk,\u201d placing them in non-Indigenous foster and adoptive homes. Many argue the modern-day child welfare system perpetuates these damaging practices.\nAnd the tragic legacy of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people is not limited to the past 40 or 50 years. Indigenous females were the victims of atrocious crimes perpetrated by the earliest miners and some pioneer settlers, and they continue to be preyed upon to this day.\nMany methods of oppression\nWhile Indigenous youth were being housed in residential schools in Canada \u2014 in operation between the 1860s and 1990s \u2014 the parents of Indigenous children were having their land rights denied, their economic opportunities curtailed, and their political voices eclipsed.\nBy the mid-19th century in B.C., then-governor James Douglas (1858-1864) \u2014 together with Indigenous peoples \u2014 had created large Indian reserves in the Fraser Valley and in parts of the B.C. Interior that were designed to accommodate First Nations\u2019 anticipated future commercial agricultural and ranching needs. Some lands in the Fraser canyon were additionally set aside to specifically enable and protect Indigenous people\u2019s ability to participate in commercial mining activities.\nHowever, three years after Douglas\u2019s retirement, his successors reduced the reserves by more than 90 per cent \u2014 without Indigenous consent. The reductions were justified in part with the argument that Indigenous peoples were traditionally fishers, not farmers, ranchers or miners, and therefore would do just fine in the emerging colonial society without large land bases \u2014 as long as they had their fishery.\nThen, in 1886, the government passed legislation making it illegal for Indigenous peoples to sell fish caught in non-tidal waters. The vast majority of First Nations suddenly found themselves with no way to engage in the emerging economy while simultaneously being denied the ability to continue their traditional economy. Hunting and gathering rights were similarly restricted through non-consultative provincial legislation.\nAlso in 1886, the federal government passed a law making Indigenous self-governance (the potlatch) and spirituality (the Tamanawas winter dance) illegal. Poverty, powerlessness and despair became normalized.\nDenied their own governance, Indigenous peoples were also barred from the political system the settlers had established for themselves. First Nations did not secure the right to participate in Canadian democracy until 1960, by which time they were a small minority which could no longer easily influence settler politics.\nGenuine reconciliation key to a better future\nThis is the larger history of which residential school abuse and intergenerational trauma are an integral part. It is an important context to consider with regard to the 215 children\u2019s remains in unmarked graves at the former Kamloops residential school. \nThis is also why reconciliation is not yet complete, and why it is so urgent that all people of goodwill come together to help contribute to the building of genuine reconciliation. \nThe building process will be complicated. It will necessarily involve restoring to Indigenous peoples a meaningful voice in decision-making relating to their ancestral lands. It will also involve adapting Canadian federalism so that the right to self-governance guaranteed in our constitution becomes operationalized in ways First Nations identify as authentic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018We Seek to Find our Loved Ones, and We Seek to Find Justice\u2019\n\tread more \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese steps must not be characterized as simply \u201cgiving\u201d something to Indigenous peoples. Rather, they are living up to the obligations we set in our own Canadian constitutional and common laws.\nLearning about \u2014 and more importantly, acknowledging \u2014 the history of the system that resulted in the deaths of 215 innocent children in Kamloops and thousands across the country is a step in the right direction. So is recognizing that alternatives not only existed then, but are also here now. \nOur challenge today is to work with First Nations to determine what tangible actions we can take as a society and as individuals to transform the empathy people feel over the tragedy of the 215 children into action that creates a real structural shift \u2014 effecting change that will make Canada a better place for Indigenous and non-Indigenous people alike. \n Read more: Indigenous, Rights + Justice, Politics  \n\n\n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Share on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Share on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Forward by Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nShare article via email\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend this article to:\n\n\n\nYour email address:\n\n\n\nYour message:\n\n\n\nWould you like to receive The Tyee's headlines free by email?\n\n\n\n                                    Yes, every day.\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Yes, once a week.\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Yes, once a week, national news only.\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    I already subscribe.\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    No, thanks.\n                                \n\n\n\nSubmit\n\nShow form again \u00bb\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0Tyee\u00a0is\u00a0supported by\u00a0readers\u00a0like\u00a0you\n\n\n\n\n\n Join us and grow independent\u00a0media in\u00a0Canada\n\n\n\n\nFacts matter.

Prince Albert Daily Herald    HomeNewsCivic AffairsSportsArtsCommunityNorthern AdvocateOpinionFlyersObituaries Home  Opinion  Finding a new path forward driven by Indigenous peopleOpinionFinding a new path forward driven by Indigenous peopleBy Daily Herald Contributor - July 9, 2021\nFacebook Twitter  By Ken CoatesMunk senior fellowMacdonald-Laurier InstituteTroy MediaPeople are mad. Finally! And sadly, belatedly.The discovery of the locations where hundreds of children were buried around abandoned residential school grounds has touched the country in ways that perhaps even the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission did not. People are responding to this revelation with sustained emotion and genuine anger. But this anger must for once be translated into action.Put aside the fact that the broad contours of students\u2019 death at residential schools were already widely known. The country\u2019s reaction to the first major revelations of the deaths of students in the state\u2019s care (revelations from decades ago at this point) was muted compared to the current response to radar-identified graves.For many years, extensive Indigenous testimony and writing have described the deaths of children at residential schools. First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis people have spoken publicly about these tragedies thousands of times, and they have for decades overshadowed life in Indigenous communities. The scale of the current revelations and the heartbreak of thinking about young children, away from family and community, dying alone in institutions characterized by a lack of essential humanity, again highlights this shared intergenerational trauma.While political parties at various levels may differ in their specific approaches, it seems that there is a shared sense of horror and disgust about the children\u2019s deaths. Unfortunately, as more remains will be found \u2013 Indigenous testimony and other evidence are clear on this vital point \u2013 public reaction will likely decline in intensity as people become numb to these horrors.We must therefore seize this moment. Surely children\u2019s graves are enough to finally force a dramatic change as opposed to the social engineering and minor tinkering that has characterized policy for generations.Government policy, far from being the solution to the issues facing Indigenous peoples, has been one of the primary sources of the problem, alongside ages-old patterns of racial discrimination and state-supported assimilation. The many faces of federal paternalism have brought and continue to bring great pain and suffering to First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit across the country.Canada must first recognize Indigenous autonomy, self-government, and sovereignty over their lands and affairs \u2013 a move that the United States led on in the 19th century. The Indian Act, reserves and all the other vestiges of 19th- and 20th-century colonization must be replaced, under terms and conditions determined primarily by Indigenous peoples. To replace these colonial structures is a tremendous legal and political task. To accomplish this effort will take time, and will require the federal government to provide funding, civil service support, the initial scoping, and then simply to get out of the way, as was done when setting up the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.Facilitating a dramatic change in how Canada manages its relationships with First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit peoples must be undergirded by an overhaul of how these communities are funded. At present, the funding due to Indigenous peoples arising from their unique place in Canadian history, and their constitutional, legal and treaty rights, is caught up in a bureaucratic web. In this web, far too much funding is determined by a system in which Ottawa makes priorities for communities, and communities with few personnel resources navigate a myriad of applications and program requirements simply trying to get the support they need.This system needs to be completely altered. Funding should instead go directly to Indigenous governments, either at a large scale (like Nunavut, M\u00e9tis Nation of Saskatchewan, or the James Bay Cree), more localized groups (like the Prince Albert Tribal Council or the Treaty 8 First Nations), or specific nations or communities (like the Carcross-Tagish First Nation or the Membertou First Nation). These communities are well equipped to manage their own priorities, and Indigenous peoples are fully capable of holding their own governments to account.Once again, the task is not a simple one, as the challenges facing Indigenous communities vary dramatically. Ottawa needs to nonetheless expand the co-production of policy at all levels, establish clear avenues for ensuring shared financial priority setting, and establish better funding equivalencies between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities. Funding allocation needs to shift away from program spending, which ebbs and flows from government to government, and move toward long-term block funding that is reliable, predictable, and fungible. There can be no autonomy for these Nations without autonomous financial decision-making, and thus these moves need to be a key part of the process.Moreover, Indigenous communities should be empowered to engage (or not engage) in the natural resource economy. They must be able to access the types of own-source revenue that non-Indigenous people take for granted, just as they should be able to exercise the right to protect their own environments as they see fit, free of interference. And, Ottawa must ensure that communities have clear access to the full range of financial tools and services that others in Canada already do, including access to capital.Ultimately, Ottawa must step back \u2013 way back \u2013 permitting the re-empowerment of Indigenous peoples and ensuring the systematic and rapid dismantling of state-driven control over Indigenous lives. This theme can carry to all elements of policy-making, whether that be education, resource development, health care, housing, and more. Negotiate modern self-governance agreements in good faith, then get out of the way.In short: greater self-governance would put Indigenous communities in a position to better determine and protect their own needs and destinies.It is impossible not to be profoundly moved by the realization that hundreds of children died in the care of the state while at residential schools in this country. This legacy will not be honoured by partisan political action, a new program or two, and the allocation of a few million dollars in additional funding.If these graves symbolize anything, it is the abject failure of decades of government policy. Find a new path forward driven by Indigenous people. Do it now. Instead of letting the memories of what happened to those Indigenous children haunt the country for years to come, let the discovery of the hundreds of bodies be the launching point.Ken S.

Darryl Dyck, The Canadian Press \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you listening?\nWhile human instinct is often to turn away from stories of violence, loss and pain, in the case of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, people should lean in.\n\n\n\"When little children reported abuse, they were not believed. When teenagers were on the streets, they were forced into sexual acts rather than asked if they needed help.\" #MMIWI #Indigenous #Women @TracySherlock \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, the B.C. government and citizens of this country should take a close look. Not only at these women, but also at themselves.\nB.C. was home to serial killer Robert Pickton, who was found guilty of killing six women, but who may have murdered many more, many of whom were Indigenous. B.C. is home to the Highway of Tears, a stretch of road in Northern B.C. where several women, many of them Indigenous, have disappeared. And today, B.C. is home to an alarming over-representation of foster children who are Indigenous, an issue that has been likened to a modern-day residential school system.\n\n\n\n\nAnd yet, when the national inquiry came to Metro Vancouver in early April, it was as though we all turned away, that it was too painful to read about, and we were too sad to witness, to listen. \nI was there for one of the hearing\u2019s five days. Most of those in attendance appeared to be either witnesses, or supporters of the witnesses or inquiry staff. There were a few reporters, but I\u2019ve seen much larger crowds of journalists at more mundane news conferences.\nAt the technical briefing for media held the day before the inquiry launched, there were six reporters present. Every single one was a woman. I\u2019m not sure I have ever been to a media event where all the reporters are women \u2013 usually more than half are men. I\u2019m also not sure exactly what this means, but I think it says a lot about who is pushing for coverage of this story. I\u2019m hoping it doesn\u2019t speak to the relative priority editors put on the story of hundreds of women dying or going missing over the past several decades.\nAlthough Indigenous women and girls make up just four per cent of the female population of Canada, nine per cent of female homicides in 1980 were Indigenous and by 2015, 24 per cent of homicide victims in Canada were Indigenous women, the commission\u2019s interim report says. It goes on to say an Indigenous woman is 12 times more likely to be murdered or missing than any other woman in Canada.\nThere were more than a thousand police-recorded incidents of murders of Indigenous women between 1980 and 2012, the RCMP reported in 2014.\nMarion Buller is Chief Commissioner of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. Canadian Press photo.The inquiry was called for by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2015. The inquiry\u2019s four commissioners \u2014 Marion Buller, Michele Audette, Brian Eyolfson and Qajaq Robinson \u2014 will report on the systemic causes of violence against Indigenous women and girls. \nThe inquiry has been beset by troubles since its 2016 launch. Another commissioner, Marilyn Poitras, resigned last July, telling the CBC she quit because the hearings were using an ineffective model with little chance of bringing about change. The commission has asked for a two-year extension to complete its work, saying it needs more time to hear from witnesses, and to do research on the criminal justice system and colonial violence. Buller told the Canadian Press that the commission has enough material to produce a report, but that it would only scratch the surface without the extension. I can\u2019t imagine the federal government refusing the request, given what\u2019s at stake. \nDespite its challenges, the inquiry expected to hear from its thousandth witness in Vancouver. Those are a thousand stories of heart ache, loss, and pain. \nEvery story I listened to was interspersed with tears and extreme love expressed with emotion. The witnesses spoke of lives spent in foster care feeling unloved, teenage years spent on the streets falling into a life of drugs and sex trade work, and young adulthood spent trying to care for babies without having been cared for themselves.\nOver and over, stories were told about how those in power failed to help when they could and often contributed to the pain. When women were reported missing, they were written off as drug addicts and prostitutes. When little children reported abuse, they were not believed. When teenagers were on the streets, they were forced into sexual acts rather than asked if they needed help.\nThese are people. Proud, dignified, loving people. We can begin by at least paying attention to their stories.\nEvery witness I heard was there for the future. Yes, they were there to remember their lost loved ones or their own painful childhoods, but they were also there to make sure the abuse stops happening.\nCarol Ruby Davis was killed in 1987. Photo supplied.\u201cAll I know is, I\u2019m here because we have young people coming up and future generations that need to feel safe in our communities and that nothing is going to happen to them,\u201d said Lori Davis, whose sister Carol Ruby Davis was killed in 1987.\nJuanita Desjarlais told the story of nearly dying after being stabbed and beaten by a man. She believes she survived so she could make things better for her son and for future generations.\n\u201cNow it\u2019s up to me to share that medicine, that strength, that bravery, honesty, truthfulness, and generosity, to continue walking in that way to share with our young people, our women and our men, because our ways haven\u2019t been forgotten,\u201d Desjarlais said.\nCynthia Cardinal, whose sister Georgina Papin was killed on Pickton\u2019s farm, said the children of missing and murdered women should be reunited with their siblings and their families.\n\u201cFamily is very important,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to be with a relative \u2013 they\u2019re not going to find love in a stranger\u2019s home.\u201d\nThis should resonate with the powers that be at the Ministry of Children and Family Development in B.C. and with federal Indigenous Services Minister Jane Philpott. It\u2019s a message that has been said over and over: Indigenous kids need to be cared for in their communities, with their families.\nCanadians and British Columbians may want to bury their heads in the sand about missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, but that would be a big mistake. If we don\u2019t want to be holding a similar hearing in another 25 years, the time for change is now.\nCommissioner Robinson urged the same.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t ignore it anymore. We do not let this happen to our neighbours and our friends and our family. \u2026 Your truth is the truth.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTracy Sherlock writes about B.C. politics for the National Observer.

Jurors who sat through three weeks of evidence at Raymond Cormier's trial found him not guilty on Feb. 22 of second-degree murder. The Indigenous girl's body, wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down by rocks, was pulled from the Red River eight days after she disappeared in August 2014. The verdict sparked rallies and protests across the country.Here is what the jury heard:THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TINA AND CORMIERCourt heard Tina had a happy childhood raised by a great-aunt on the Sagkeeng First Nation, but the girl began to spiral downward when her father was murdered in October 2011. Tina's mother, who had not been part of her life, re-emerged and Tina started going to Winnipeg to visit her. The girl ended up on the street and was being sexually exploited. Tina's boyfriend Cody Mason, who was 18 at the time, testified the pair first met Cormier earlier in the summer of 2014 and told him they didn't have a place to stay. Cormier, who court heard was a methamphetamine and crack user, took them to a house with a basement. Known to some as Sebastian and to others as Frenchy, Cormier supplied Tina with the prescription drug gabapentin, said Mason, who added he and Tina would also drink and take marijuana and cocaine. Tina told a social worker that Cormier was a much older man who was going to get her a bike. Cormier told friends he had had sex with the 15-year-old. One witness, Sarah Holland, testified she once saw Cormier grope Tina while asking her to \"just do me.\"\u2014-THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCEThe cause of Tina's death was undetermined. Dr. Dennis Rhee testified that he found no definitive injuries on her body or to her internal organs. He said there was no evidence of a sexual assault, no signs of a stabbing or major blunt force trauma. It was estimated her body was in the river for three to seven days. There was no evidence that she drowned, but it couldn't be ruled out. Christopher Keddy, who works at the RCMP forensics lab, testified that tests showed Tina's body had a level of alcohol slightly above the legal limit for driving. Keddy also said there was a relatively high level of THC - the active ingredient in marijuana. There was no indication of gabapentin, but Keddy said the test the RCMP lab ran might not detect low levels of the drug. Under cross-examination, the defence suggested it couldn't be ruled out that gabapentin was in Tina's system at a potentially lethal level in combination with other drugs. There was no DNA evidence linking Cormier to Fontaine.\u2014-THE DUVET COVERThree people connected to Cormier told police he owned the same type of duvet cover that was wrapped around Tina's body. DNA testing found no traces linking Cormier to the cover. Court heard police tried to find the source of the duvet cover. It was sold by Costco Canada and 864 had been shipped to the three Costco stores in Winnipeg. Police tracked down 100 people who had purchased covers with the same design to ask them whether they still had them. Under cross-examination, investigators acknowledged Costco had given away some of the unsold duvet covers, and police could not rule out whether similar ones had been purchased elsewhere and brought to Winnipeg.\u2014-THE ARGUMENT ON THE STREETOn Aug. 6, about two weeks before Tina's body was found and three days before she was reported missing, witnesses saw her arguing with Cormier in the street and heard Cormier mention something about a river. Holland testified that she heard Tina tell Cormier she was going to call the cops. The Crown argued that Cormier was worried that Tina was going to report that he had stolen a truck. Court heard an audio recording of Tina calling 911 to report a stolen truck. Witnesses also testified that Tina was angry that Cormier had sold her bike for drugs. Cormier acknowledged the argument in an interview with police and said he followed her down the street before turning in the other direction. He said that was the last time he saw her. He also suggested the suspect police should look for was a man who looked like singer Robert Plant and who was walking in the same direction as Tina that night. \"Don't focus on me,\" he told police.\u2014-ERNIE DeWOLFEDeWolfe met Cormier in prison and they stayed at the same halfway house for a time. DeWolfe testified he talked to Cormier on Aug. 15 and Cormier said he had met with Tina the previous day to ensure she was not going to call the police. \"He just said that he had talked to her and he straightened it all out and took care of it,\" DeWolfe testified. \"I just presumed that he talked to her and ... sorted it out.\" Tina's body was found in the river on Aug. 17. In cross-examination, the defence suggested DeWolfe made the whole story up because he and Cormier had had an argument over money.\u2014-THE UNDERCOVER TAPESPolice launched a six-month undercover operation against Cormier called Project Styx. Cormier was placed in a bugged apartment for free and an undercover officer moved into a suite on the same floor. Cormier was recorded saying he'd bet the girl was killed because he found out she was only 15 years old. \"I drew the line and that's why she got killed,\" he said. Cormier also told a woman that when he last talked to Tina, he told her to go jump off a bridge. At another point, he asked a woman if she had ever been \"haunted by something\" before he started to talk about Tina and boast that he beat two murders. During another recording, Cormier said during an argument with a woman that there was a little girl in a \"grave someplace screaming at the top of her lungs for me to finish the job. And guess what? I finished the job.\" Court also heard Cormier in a recording warning people in his apartment not to overdose or they would end up wrapped in a carpet and thrown in the river. In conversations with the undercover officer, Cormier said there were \"three rules to crime: deny, deny deny.\"\u2014-THE ARGUMENTSCrown prosecutors contended that Cormier killed Tina, either by suffocation or drowning, because he found out she was only 15 and that would make him a pedophile. They said Cormier's own words on the undercover tapes should be enough to convict him. The defence said that with no DNA evidence and no cause of death, there were too many holes in the case. It argued that Cormier felt guilt after learning that Tina was only 15 and he wanted to find the real killer.\u2014-\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAdvertise With Us\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Error\nSubmit a Tip\nRefundRefund\n\n\n\nThe Brandon Sun is not accepting comments on this story.\nWhy aren't comments accepted on this story?

The family of nine siblings born between 1960 and 1970 all grew up in foster care or on the streets.\n\n\nLori Davis told the story of her sister, Carol Ruby Davis, who was murdered in 1987. Her pain was palpable when she shared how her sister\u2019s name was misspelled on the missing women\u2019s poster and how it made her feel her sister was forgotten. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFowler said reporting her sister missing felt like reporting a missing wallet.\n\u201cI guess I felt like they didn\u2019t take us seriously,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\nThe family didn\u2019t get regular updates from the police.\n\u201cI found out (about Georgina\u2019s remains) reading it in the Edmonton newspaper. I couldn\u2019t stop shaking when I read it,\u201d Cardinal said.\nFowler, the youngest of the siblings, said she lived in five foster homes by the age of five and that life was \u201cviolent and nerve wracking.\u201d\n\u201cI remember being terrified every day,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever I did I got in trouble for it, even laughing.\u201d\n[Georgina Papin's remains were found on Robert Pickton's farm in 2002. Photo supplied.]Eventually, Fowler met her older sister, Papin, and spent quite a bit of time with her and was devastated when she died. Her hopes today are for Georgina\u2019s children.\n\u201cWe need to have healing for the kids. It\u2019s not money that\u2019s going to fix that. It\u2019s love and culture and us,\u201d Fowler said.\nCommission to examine and report on systemic causes of violence \nCommissioners Marion Bhuller, Michele Audette, Brian Eyolfson and Qajaq Robinson are tasked with examining and reporting on the systemic causes of violence against Indigenous women and girls. The inquiry was called for by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2015 and since it began, more than 1,400 family members and survivors have registered to participate.\nAlthough Indigenous women and girls make up just four per cent of the female population of Canada, by 2015, 24 per cent of homicide victims in Canada were Indigenous women, the commission\u2019s interim report says. An Indigenous woman is 12 times more likely to be murdered or missing than any other woman in Canada, the report says.\n\u201cThe issues facing Indigenous women and girls are complex and systemic,\u201d the interim report says. \u201cPeople are concerned about how to address issues linked to cultural genocide, residential schools, and the Sixties Scoop, each with intergenerational impacts, without feeding harmful stereotypes or causing further harm.\u201d\nThe Commission has asked for a two-year extension to complete its work and lists a number of operational and communications challenges in its interim report. One commissioner, Marilyn Poitras, resigned last July, telling the CBC she quit because the hearings were using an ineffective model with little chance of change.\nThe inquiry opened with a blanket ceremony to signify a fresh start or a new beginning. All of the hearings took place on comfy chairs, where witnesses were surrounded by supporters in rooms covered with memorial quilts on the walls.\nGrand Chief Stewart Phillip spoke during the opening, saying his heart is with the witnesses.\n\u201cWe have an opportunity here to once again stand together shoulder to shoulder \u2026 and to reach down into our hearts and souls and find that special courage to share our stories, which are so, so important for the world, for this country and for our people to hear,\u201d Phillip said.\nCarol Ruby Davis was found dead in Burnaby in 1987. Photo supplied.Witness says she felt her sister was forgotten\nLori Davis told the story of her sister, Carol Ruby Davis, who was murdered in 1987. Her pain was palpable when she shared how her sister\u2019s name was misspelled on the missing women\u2019s poster and how it made her feel her sister was forgotten and that she herself was invisible.\nShe said she was planning to bury her sister in an outfit of new clothes she bought specifically for an open-casket ceremony.\n\u201cIt was at that point the police told me the only way they knew who she was, was from her teeth,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI guess she\u2019d been there for a while and we hadn\u2019t heard from her for a while. \u2026 It was only bones and teeth that were left of her.\u201d\nBut Davis finished her story with a strong message from her 20-year-old niece and hope for the next generation.\nJuanita Desjarlais told her story of being abused as a child, raped as a teenager and stabbed and beaten nearly to death as a young person. She was placed in foster care at about age five and remembers being confined to a room, with food slipped under the door.\n\u201cI never had that bonding or that love provided to me, like children should have,\u201d she told the inquiry.\nAs a teenager, she became addicted to heroin and cocaine, was forced into sex work to pay for drugs and gave birth to a stillborn baby.\nBut she also told the story about getting clean after nearly being stabbed to death.\n\u201cI believe it was divine intervention or something \u2013 I was supposed to live to share my story to encourage and inspire our young people, our girls, to be brave,\u201d Desjarlais said. \u201cThere is a time that\u2019s coming where our younger generation will rise up for what\u2019s right and all those perpetrators out there will be ousted.\u201d\nJamie Lee Hamilton, a transgender woman who grew up on the east side of Vancouver, told the inquiry that she was involved in the sex trade on and off for 48 years. Hamilton has run for several civic political offices as an independent candidate, most recently in 2017 when she ran for the Vancouver School Board.\nShe told the inquiry that she experienced violence during her work in the sex trade, both from clients and from the police. She said she knew many women who went missing from the Downtown Eastside and that they were \u201cconsidered disposables, throwaways.\u201d\n\u201cThere were so, so many (missing women) and they deserved so much better,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cIt was so sad to see them going missing and nothing being done.\u201d\nRichmond sessions will include nearly 100 witnesses \nThe hearings in Richmond are the biggest to date, with nearly 100 people registered to tell their stories. If the commission isn\u2019t granted the extension it has requested, these will be the last public hearings.\n\u201cThis week we\u2019re going to hear from our 1,000th witness and more,\u201d Chief Commissioner Marion Bhuller told the inquiry. \u201cThey are courageous people who have come forward \u2026 to share their truths. They are rewriting Canadian history and setting the record straight about the lives of Indigenous women and girls.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to reclaim our rightful places as Indigenous people in Canada. Our rightful places as respected, beautiful, strong people who have answers all Canadians need to hear.\u201d\nThe Richmond event is hosted by four First Nations Tsleil-Waututh, Squamish, Musqueam and Tsawwassen and will continue through Sunday. While in the Lower Mainland, the commission will also collect statements from people in the Downtown Eastside.\n\n\n\n\n[email\u00a0protected]\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigative journalism has never been more important.

Since then nine non-compliance orders have been issued by the tribunal to force Canada to end the discrimination.\nThen last September the tribunal ordered Canada to pay each child\u00a0$40,000 in damages between Jan. 2006 to present day.\nSince then Canada has tried to get the order dismissed by appealing to the Federal Court for a judicial review and is still seeking that ruling while in discussions with Blackstock and the AFN since December on how the compensation should work.\n\u201cWhile they are working on the process, and there has been some progress, Canada is continuing its efforts to quash all financial compensation,\u201d Blackstock said on Nation to Nation that airs Thursday.\nBlackstock and the AFN also believe the parents of children that died in care should be compensated.\n\u201cIt breaks my heart,\u201d she said of Canada saying otherwise. \u201cI think of youth like Tina Fontaine who died waiting [and] and Jolynn Winter from Wapekeka [First Nation] whose life was lost to suicide.\u201d\nFontaine\u2019s death was ruled a homicide after body was pulled from a Winnipeg river in 2015. The 15-year-old was in care and placed in a downtown hotel when she disappeared. Her homicide is unsolved.\nWinter, 12, was living in a Sioux Lookout foster home when she was returned to her home community in northern Ontario for the first time in her life after a serious suicide attempt. A few weeks later she killed herself.\nAn APTN investigation found in September that the federal government underfunded three on-reserve child welfare agencies by approximately $400 million between 2013 and 2017 compared to off-reserve agencies.\nDuring that time, 72 First Nations children died in that region. Across Ontario, 102 died.\nAnd in the two years it took for the Trudeau government to respond to tribunal orders to increase funding to these agencies, 48 First Nations children died in Ontario connected to child welfare.\nFrater argued in his letter that these families may be able to seek damages in other legal proceedings, including one of two pending class-action lawsuits currently before the courts.\n\u201cThis does not necessarily mean that the estates of other deceased individuals may not be compensated outside of Tribunal proceedings,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTwo potential class actions have emerged. The issue of who should be compensated under either of those actions should be negotiated between the parties, as it was in previous class action settlements for Indian Residential Schools and the \u2018Sixties Scoop\u2019\u201d.\nCatch all of Blackstock\u2019s interview tonight on Nation on Nation.\nAs well our political panel breaks down all the Wet\u2019suewet\u2019en solidarity demonstrations.\nNDP MP Leah Gazan said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has failed the country by flip-flopping on his call for patience only to say in a matter of days last week Canadians were losing their patience with all the demonstrations.\nTrudeau then said all the protests and blockades needed to end. He stopped short of saying police needed to act but that\u2019s what happened.\nIn several ways it made matters worse.\n\u201cWe know that this would just escalate the situation. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing right now and I think that it shows a real failure of the current prime minister,\u201d said Gazan.\nBut Liberal MP Gary Anandasangaree\u00a0said his boss has show courage in the all attacks from opposition.\n\u201cFrankly, I think our prime minister has shown a great deal of leadership, a great deal of resolve,\u201d he said.\nN2N@aptn.ca\n\u00a0\n\n\nTags: amy owen, Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, Child Welfare, Courtney Scott, Featured, Jolynn Winter, Justin Trudeau, Kanina Sue Turtle, Kyler leclair, National,

His son murdered his granddaughter. Trent Butt, 40, was found guilty in March of killing his five-year-old daughter, Quinn, in 2016 and was sentenced to life in prison without eligibility for parole for 25 years. In a very real sense, Herb Butt lost a son as well as a granddaughter.\nTrent Butt\u2019s statement in court that he would never do anything to hurt his daughter was obnoxious beyond description, and probably had many people hoping he got the maximum sentence.\nIn his letter, Herb Butt says he believes his son in that regard.\nIt is one thing to love and support your children unconditionally \u2014 which automatically comes with good parenting \u2014 but Trent Butt\u2019s assertion is obviously and demonstrably false, as the jury in the case rightly determined.\nHe would never hurt her, but he killed her. The denial of personal responsibility is astounding.\nIn court, Trent Butt cast blame on the legal system, apparently due to the antagonistic divorce proceedings and custody arguments with his ex-wife, Andrea Gosse.\nThis sentiment is echoed and supported by Herb Butt in his letter.\n\nTrent Butt\u2019s statement in court that he would never do anything to hurt his daughter was obnoxious beyond description, and probably had many people hoping he got the maximum sentence.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cThere has been a lot of negative attitudes towards my son, saying he did it out of revenge. My son\u2019s suicide letter \u2018Final Words\u2019 focused on his love for Quinn, not revenge for her mother. There are members of the media and the general public who should not be too quick to judge, because research and forensic psychiatry paint a more complicated picture in which society may not just be a witness but an accomplice to these types of crimes.\u201d\nNo, sir. Society did not contribute to the tragic death of your granddaughter. One thing, and one thing only, killed little Quinn: Trent Butt.\nTo say otherwise is to declare that Trent Butt did not have free will, that he did not have control over his own decisions, that he could not choose any other course of action.\nCommon view\nHerb Butt\u2019s disturbing interpretation of his family\u2019s tragedy is, unfortunately, a common mode of thinking these days. The concepts of free will and individual mind are seemingly archaic.\nCanadian social discourse hit a new low with the recent release of the report by the Commission of Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls. Most of the outraged commentary focused on the report\u2019s preposterous accusation that Canada is conducting \u201cgenocide\u201d against Indigenous women and girls.\nThe report\u2019s horrendously painful jargon is insufferable, but far worse is the pathetically predictable reasoning. Like Herb Butt in his letter, the MMIWG report resorts to excuses and casts blame other than where it should be cast.\nAccording to the MMIWG report, violence against Indigenous women and girls is \u201crooted in colonialism\u201d (page 11).\nIt claims \u201c\u2026violence against Indigenous women and girls is a crisis centuries in the making. The process of colonization has, in fact, created the conditions of the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women\u2026\u201d (page 19).\nApparently, Indigenous men do not have free will, independent minds or control over their own actions. Here is a fact the MMIWG commissioners don\u2019t want to hear: it doesn\u2019t matter how much racism, poverty, hardship, unemployment, isolation, lack of opportunity or education, etc. Indigenous men have had to face in this largely unjust world, there is no excuse for beating or killing their wife or girlfriend.\nBrian Jones is a desk editor at The Telegram.

Seeing them flanked by First Nations elders was a powerful sight for Goforth.\nGoforth, whose daughter Kelly was murdered three years ago in Regina, was \u201cso happy\u201d the federal ministers were there to hear their experiences and suggestions on improving the system.\n\u201cI feel like in some small way, if I contributed to this inquiry, then good. I\u2019ve accomplished something on behalf of my baby girl,\u201d said Goforth, who hopes there will be more forums in the future.\n\n\n\nMaxine Goforth and her three-year-old grandson KC. KC\u2019s mother, Goforth\u2019s daughter Kelly, was murdered in 2013.\n\nDon Healy /  \n\nRegina Leader-Post\n\n\n\nThe inquiry is \u201cnever going to bring back our loved ones, I understand that, but it\u2019s going to improve for the future of the young ones growing up, my grandchildren,\u201d Goforth added.\nThe input of families from 18 forums across Canada will be considered in planning the next steps of the inquiry.\nIt\u2019s \u201cso profoundly moving and agonizing from a personal and human point of view, to sit in that room and hear the families of the victims describe what happened to their loved ones as far as they know, describe the sheer agony of not knowing for years and years and years,\u201d said Goodale, a federal cabinet minister.\n\u201c(It) just underlines the point that you\u2019ve got to get this right. This cannot be some kind of ordinary, routine, business as usual.\u201d\nThe gathering was closed to media and the public.\nIn 2014, the RCMP reported that 1,181 indigenous women and girls were murdered or remained missing between 1980 and 2012; 16 per cent of women murdered in that time frame were aboriginal, though they made up four per cent of the population.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something systemic here that society has to come to grips with,\u201d said Goodale, adding the input of victims\u2019 families is important for getting the inquiry right.\n\n\n\nMP Ralph Goodale attended Tuesday\u2019s forum for families of missing and murdered indigenous women in Regina.\n\nBRYAN SCHLOSSER /  \n\nRegina Leader-Post\n\n\n\nIf \u201cat the end of the day those victims and families of victims are still saying \u2018you don\u2019t get it, you didn\u2019t hear me, this is not a solution for me,\u2019 then the process will not have been successful,\u201d said Goodale.\n\u201cThe government of Canada will get one chance to get this right.\u201d\nGoodale said a couple of messages were iterated throughout the morning: one of respect and validation; the other of fixing what\u2019s broken and affecting real change.\n\u201cThe families of the victims have waited so long, and for so much of that time the reaction from governments and from the general society was sort of like, \u2018Get over it,\u2019\u201d said Goodale. \u201cThey have suffered a lot as a consequence of that, feeling in a way dismissed, not believed, demeaned.\n\u201cIt really is important for us to be able to, as a country, as a society, grow beyond that dismissive kind of feeling that has existed in the past.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much racism, there\u2019s so much exploitation and \u2026 there\u2019s no one thing that\u2019s going to stop it,\u201d said Goforth. \u201cWe just have to work together collectively as a whole in Canada, that\u2019s what I believe. Everybody needs to be educated across the board.\u201d\nGoforth is hopeful the inquiry will lead to action.\n\u201cThey have a big job to do, these people, and I commended them for that,\u201d said Goforth.\nThe second Saskatchewan forum is happening Wednesday in Saskatoon.\namartin@postmedia.com\ntwitter.com/LPAshleyM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ue221\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA victim of pedophile Peter Whitmore, Miller is relieved to go...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLatest Local News Videos \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal News\ue221From lifeguard to Regina city manager \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChris Holden began working for the City of Regina at 16 years old as a lifeguard.

The national force often acts as the main service for those living on-reserve because of contract policing agreements that it has in place with all provinces except Quebec and Ontario, which have their own provincial forces.Crimes such as the stabbing rampage on James Smith Cree Nation in September, which left 11 dead and 18 others injured, have amplified the calls for reform.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal NDP Indigenous services critic Lori Idlout said that the tragedy reinforced a critical need for First Nations policing.\"The Liberal government keeps failing them through continuous delays in introducing the legislation,\" the Nunavut MP said in a statement.\"Indigenous peoples have the solutions; they just need a federal partner willing to provide long-term, sufficient and equitable funding.\"Funding is indeed viewed as one of the major barriers. Since 1991, Ottawa has provided funding for police services on First Nations and in Inuit communities, but an internal evaluation this year found the program suffered from a lack of resources and the underfunding of service agreements.Passing legislation that declares policing on First Nations to be an essential service is the easy part, Picard said.\"How do we fund it is the harder part,\" he said. \"This is really what's at stake here.\"Picard added that many elements will need to be taken into account, such as salaries, benefits, training and infrastructure \u2014 not to mention how needs will differ depending on factors such as a community's remoteness.\"It is complex,\" he said.The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls also flagged concerns around the inadequate funding with the existing program, and its 2019 report included a call to action to \"dramatically transform Indigenous policing.\"It said Indigenous police services must be funded to the same level as non-Indigenous ones, and undergo audits by civilian oversight bodies.There are currently 35 First Nations police services in the country, according to Public Safety Canada, the majority of which operate in Ontario and Quebec.The First Nations Chiefs of Police Association has said it's received dozens of calls from other communities looking to go the same route, which it says can be a lengthy, complicated process.Despite not yet coming out with a new law, Mendicino said his government has made progress on the issue by reaching an agreement with the Alberta government and province's Siksika Nation that would allow the community to transition away from relying on the RCMP and instead create a self-administered police service.Mendicino pointed out that Ottawa also signed an agreement with the Saskatchewan government and the Prince Albert Grand Council, which includes James Smith Cree Nation, to explore new ways to deliver public safety.\"That's what moving forward with reconciliation looks like,\" he said. \"There's still a long way to go.\"This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 21, 2022.\n\n\n\nThe Canadian Press.

Her family says they are still trying to find out exactly how Turtle died.\u00a0\u00a0(Facebook)\u00a0\u00a0By Tanya TalagaStaff ReporterTues., May 2, 2017Indigenous leaders want a mandatory inquest to be held whenever an indigenous child dies while in care at an Ontario group home.In the wake of the deaths of two indigenous girls in April, Nishnawbe Aski Nation, a political organization of 49 northern Ontario First Nations, said it will introduce a motion Wednesday at the Chiefs of Ontario special assembly in Gatineau, Que., calling on the Chief Coroner of Ontario to hold an inquest. But they also want legislative change that applies to all Ontario kids \u2014indigenous and non-indigenous.\u201cWe want them to change legislation to make (inquests into) these types of tragic deaths mandatory. They should automatically be reviewed by the chief coroner. We need to find out more about the true situation about these cases. We are concerned, overall, about the number of children who are in these types of situations,\u201d said Nishnawbe Aski Nation Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler.The inquest must probe systemic issues that led to the girls\u2019 deaths while in care so that any death of a youth in a group home setting will automatically result in a mandatory inquest, he said.Article Continued BelowPoplar Hill First Nation\u2019s Amy Owen took her life April 17 at an Ottawa-area group home. Poplar Hill is a remote First Nation of about 500 people, nearly 120 kilometres north of Red Lake on the Manitoba-Ontario border.Jeffrey Owen, Amy\u2019s father, said she was a \u201csmart, outgoing girl who liked to have fun.\u201d \u201cShe wanted to come home, she didn\u2019t like where she was,\u201d he said in an interview Monday. He added she was supposed to be supervised around the clock. \u201cWe want justice for them. I\u2019m sure Amy wouldn\u2019t want us to give up.\u201dFort Albany First Nation\u2019s Courtney Scott, 16, died in a fire at her group home on April 21 in Orleans, Ont.. Her family, originally from the James Bay coast, has many questions about how Scott died.As well, the Star learned of a third girl, Kanina Turtle, 15, who died Oct. 29, 2016. Her Poplar Hill First Nation family told the Star someone told them Turtle committed suicide but they said they have not been officially contacted by medical professionals and are still trying to find out exactly how Turtle died.All three girls are member of NAN communities, and NAN has jurisdiction over their well being, regardless of where they live. Kids who are put in care \u2014 for a variety of reasons, including access to mental health care \u2014 are often taken out of their communities and placed in southern urban centres because the appropriate care is unavailable up north. However, NAN is in the dark as to where their kids are placed and what services they are receiving.The longer term objective to the inquest, said Fiddler, is for Ontario and Canada to work with us to bring these services closer to home. \u201cOur kids shouldn\u2019t be sent 1,000 miles away for them to be able to support these services so they aren\u2019t disconnected from their families,\u201d he said.The owner of the group home that Amy Owen spent more than one year in before she was transferred to a more secure site, said there needs to be a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding the 13-year-old\u2019s death.Esther Aiken is the director of the Beacon Home in Prescott, Ont. Aiken and her staff knew Owen well and have been grief-stricken since they heard of her death. Owen was with Beacon for one year before she went back home to her Poplar Hill home for nearly eight months in 2016. However, she returned to Beacon last fall until she was transferred to an Ottawa home in January that was better equipped to handle her suicidal tendencies.\u201cWe felt she needed a safer environment than what we could provide. We have rarely asked for a child to go to another home. Amy was an extreme exception,\u201d Aiken said.Clients usually come to the girls-only Beacon Home for six months to one year. The home is small, a seven-bed facility with two to seven kids at the home at any given time. Aiken said the majority of her clients are indigenous kids who have to come to Beacon in order to access proper psychiatric and medical treatment in the Ottawa area. \u201cThe children brought down south to group homes are brought here to access mental health services they don\u2019t have in their communities,\u201d Aiken said. \u201cThere are pre-existing problems that warrant the kids to be brought here in the first place. Many of the kids are suicidal and they need specialized care.\u201dAiken said the majority of their girls are dealing with addiction issues with alcohol or drugs, those who self harm, or have suicidal thoughts.First Nations kids are disproportionately represented in the child welfare system, said Irwin Elman, the Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth. There are no accurate numbers as to how many of the 3,000 children living in Ontario group homes and another 15,000 living in foster homes, are indigenous or where they are. \u201cYoung people have told us they feel isolated in these homes. First Nations children, for sure, who are thousands of kilometres away from their home, their culture and language and ways of life,\u201d Elman said.\u201cThere is an urgent situation and we have to do something right now so another child doesn\u2019t die.\u201dYoung indigenous people should be placed closer to their homes so they have community support, he said. They are often taken out of their communities and sent to homes that aren\u2019t trained enough to handle them for particular reasons and they end up getting bounced from home to home. \u201cTheir journey in the system can cause more issues . . . young people, First Nations and others, sometimes talk about they know some child and youth workers in some places talk about the places they are at, as \u2018storage.\u2019 \u201dYouth feel there is no where else to go. \u201cIf they don\u2019t see their worker and don\u2019t have connection to their family, what is it if it is not storage? Is this what we want to tell the child we make a covenant to, telling them we will care for them? It is not acceptable.\u201dHe remembers one call from an indigenous 13-year-old who called the advocate\u2019s office asking for help to call home and talk to her mom, whom she hasn\u2019t seen in over one year.\u201cWhy should it be that a 13-year-old or 14-year-old child has to call our office to arrange for a Skype call with her mom? In some homes, that is the situation and conditions children are living in and it\u2019s not acceptable,\u201d he said.

corrections officer Robert Jeffrey Morden with \u201ccriminal negligence causing death and failure to provide the necessaries of life\u201d during the 2021 death of inmate William Ahmo.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nAn awkward moment occurred during the announcement that RCMP were charging Headingley corrections officer Robert Jeffrey Morden with \"criminal negligence causing death and failure to provide the necessaries of life\" during the 2021 death of inmate William Ahmo.\t\t\t\n\"We\u2019re kind of hoping this investigation shows to the family we\u2019ve taken this seriously,\" stated RCMP spokesman Sgt. Paul Manaigre.\t\t\t   \n  \nThis wasn\u2019t weirdest moment, though.\t\t\t\n\"A lot of man-hours, a lot of resources were put into play here to get the answers that this family has been searching for for 11 months,\" he added.\t\t\t\nThere\u2019s so much to say one doesn\u2019t know where to begin.\t\t\t\nA human being died while in care in a Manitoba institution. Of course it\u2019s serious. RCMP saying they\u2019re serious this time makes one wonder how many times they were not. Or, worse, that without the family asking questions this investigation may not have been.\t\t\t\nWhy did Manaigre feel the need to list off the \"man-hours\" and \"resources\" to convince the Ahmo family of RCMP seriousness? Why does the cost of justice matter? Doesn\u2019t the RCMP \u2014 the public body tasked with uncovering justice \u2014 want those answers too? Does anyone care if it takes one dollar or a million to uncover the truth when someone is killed?\t\t\t\nImagine RCMP telling a white family the same thing.\t\t\t\nImagine a police spokesman announcing they are taking a white man\u2019s death seriously so his family should be thankful.\t\t\t\nImagine how that family would feel.\t\t\t\nI spoke to the Ahmo family via their lawyer Sunday morning.\t\t\t\nThey wanted to talk but \"off the record\" because they did not want to \"interfere with the prosecution\" and were fearful of saying anything \"that could complicate the process.\"\t\t\t\nI told them I understood. I know the family in many ways and I\u2019m aware of how tenuous justice is in the Indigenous community.\t\t\t\nI also know certain details in this case, like the alleged racist remarks and actions of jail guards that preceded Ahmo\u2019s death.\t\t\t\nThe trial will be all about these alleged \"racist remarks.\" It will be about the fact Ahmo died while in jail; that he\u2019s Indigenous; and that Morden is non-Indigenous or \u2013 even more \u2013 if he is.\t\t\t\nIf Saskatchewan farmer Gerald Stanley can be found not-guilty for shooting 22-year old Indigenous man Colten Boushie in the back of the head because a jury believed the gun went off \"accidentally,\" it doesn\u2019t really matter how much evidence police have collected.\t\t\t\nMorden\u2019s trial is going to be political, with dozens of historical intersections at once. It will be about theatrics, persuasion, and well, politics.\t\t\t\nThe RCMP statement on Friday was as political as you can get.\t\t\t\nWe will never know what would have happened if the media and public had not joined with the family to put pressure on police to investigate Ahmo\u2019s death, but history says otherwise.\t\t\t\nThe fact is RCMP don\u2019t often take seriously Indigenous deaths while in custody and certainly don\u2019t put \"man-hours\" and \"resources\" into finding out what happened.\t\t\t\nIf you want evidence, try the 61 deaths in custody a CBC report uncovered last December \u2013 many of whom are in Manitoba. Examine the nine Manitoba inmates who have died by suicide in their cells since 2019. Read about the first inmate death in history at the Women\u2019s Correctional Centre last May.\t\t\t\nVirtually all are deaths of Indigenous peoples and almost no one knows their names.\t\t\t\nWhen the public and media don\u2019t care, RCMP don\u2019t often act. If there is an investigation, it\u2019s fraught with, well, politics.\t\t\t\nI wish it was different and we could blame a few \"bad apples\" \u2013 and no doubt Morden will be tossed onto this pile if found guilty \u2013 but Indigenous deaths in custody isn\u2019t about \"bad apples.\"\t\t\t\nIt\u2019s about the entire tree.\t\t\t\nIt\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know this. Multiple reports going back decades like the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry have told Manitoba that Indigenous peoples are sent to jail more than anyone else, often die there, and almost no one is held to account.\t\t\t\nGovernments, police, and yes, you and me, don\u2019t care much about it.\t\t\t \n\nWant to get a head start on your day?\nGet the day\u2019s breaking stories, weather forecast, and more sent straight to your inbox every weekday morning.\nSign up for Head Start\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\nI agree to the Terms and Conditions, Cookie and Privacy Policies, and CASL agreement. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is, until someone points it out, asks questions, and pressures for change.\t\t\t\nIn their official statement in reaction to Friday\u2019s announcement, the Ahmo family said they are \"relieved\" and \"cautiously optimistic.\" They also stated they are \"grateful\" and acknowledged the \"RCMP has been respectful to our family through the process.\"\t\t\t\nA mourning family being treated with dignity, by the way, is what\u2019s supposed to happen.\t\t\t\nThe family also state that \"securing justice for Will is going to be costly,\" pointing out they have established a GoFundMe page to \"help pay costs related to the fight for justice.\"\t\t\t\nThere\u2019s that awkward moment again.\t\t\t\nniigaan.sinclair@freepress.mb.ca\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\nNiigaan SinclairColumnist\nNiigaan Sinclair is Anishinaabe and is a columnist at the Winnipeg Free Press. \n\u00a0\u00a0 Read full biography\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdvertisement\nAdvertise With Us\n\n\n \nReport Error\nSubmit a Tip\nRefund\n\n\n\nThe Winnipeg Free Press invites you to share your opinion on this story in a letter to the editor.

She came from Prince Rupert to tell her story in hopes that they can see justice and help improve safety along the Highway of Tears.\nShe is the youngest of 4 and was only 6 months old when her mother\u2019s body was found 21 KM outside. Left to live with her paternal grandparents, she left at the age of 13 because of abuse that she didn\u2019t want to discuss the details of in her tearful testimony.\nHill started learning about her mother in 2006, and for the past 11 years she has been investigating Mary Jane\u2019s death- a journey that she says the RCMP hasn\u2019t made any easier.\nAfter receiving a scrapbook from a support worker about her mother\u2019s death, Vicki started to look for information herself so she went to the RCMP and requested the file pertaining to her mother, only to discover that to this day the RCMP will not give her the file. Their reasons? They say the photos are too graphic and disturbing for Vicki.\nThe only information that she has received about her mother is her death inquisition, which states that her mother died from manslaughter, as well as that her mother had not taken her epilepsy medication in at least 48 hours before her death.\nMary Jane Hill also had bronchitis and bronchopneumonia at the time of her death, which was detailed as March 26th 1978 by the coroners. Vicki received her mother\u2019s death certificate from the same person who made her the scrapbook and helped her along the journey to discover the truth about her mother- Kerry Riddle.\nVicki participated in Project E-PANA, a BC investigation that looked into disappearances of women on the Highway of Tears, but after explaining the details of her story, they determined that Mary Jane didn\u2019t \u2018fit the criteria\u2019 to be considered one of the Highway\u2019s victims.\nMary Jane\u2019s clothing was discovered in an alley in Prince Rupert with her medication in the pocket and traces of semen. Mary Jane had no traces of drugs or alcohol in her system. She was found on the side of the Highway. Yet, still to this day she is not on the Missing and Murdered site, and not classified as a victim.\nVicki says she is frustrated because nobody is listening to her, nobody cares about her story and after surmounting frustration and disrespect, Vicki has given up looking because she says it\u2019s not getting her anywhere.\n\nHer recommendations to help stop these disappearances was logical and something that anyone from the area could easily identify- better cellular service and emergency phones along the highway, more signage to encourage people not to hitchhike, and of course better transportation services. She was the first person of the day to mention Greyhound pulling out of Northern BC, but wasn\u2019t the only. Vicki says there are not effective enough services for cab companies and public transportation which leads people to hitchhike because they literally have no other way to get around. Other issues brought up for the region was the lack of stable councilling and mental health services, as well as detox and treatment centres.\n\nAfter an intermission, the Hearings continued with the story of Destiny Tom.\nDaughter of Burns Lake Chief Vivan Tom, who was supposed to testify earlier that morning but due to unforeseen medical issues she wasn\u2019t able to attend the hearings until 1:30. This pushed back the itinerary of the hearings and commissioners Buller and Audette split into two separate rooms to hear stories from loved ones while attempting to maintain a sensible time frame.\nVivian\u2019s testimony was lively and heartfelt. Although answers as to why the tragedy happened to her daughter remain, she has the closure of knowing what happened and who took her daughter\u2019s life.\nVivian and her husband are currently raising her granddaughter Cassidy after Destiny died as the result of domestic violence. Her testimony started off illustrating the difference between how society was when she was little compared to now. She says that children now have no respect for their parents, because back when she was being raised by her grandparents, they were more strict with higher expectations from their children.\nShe also went into her ongoing health problems since she was young, constantly suffering from lung infections, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. The former drug and alcohol counselor said she had to work twice as hard and she would never allow drinking and drugs in her home after having alcoholic parents. She wanted to ensure that she had a safe home for her children.\nWhen Destiny was in high school she started to date Garret George. It became evident to her mother that as the relationship progressed he became more controlling and abusive towards Destiny.\nVivian recalls the first incident where she found out her daughter was being abused. As Destiny approached graduation her friends were planning a grad trip to Calgary. Garret didn\u2019t want Desinty to go on the trip because at the time she was 3 1/2 months pregnant with her daughter.\nVivian recalls her version of the story. Destiny and Garret were at her house when the incident happened. She said that she arrived back home for a moment and was having problems with her van door. She asked for Garret\u2019s help when she noticed that there was blood in the kitchen. Garret was prone to get nosebleeds so she joked about them only being there for a few minutes before messing up her house.\nGarret fixed the door and Vivian left. Her brother showed up a short time later to the house and noticed that there was a lot more blood than Vivian had noticed. The door to Destiny\u2019s bedroom was locked so her uncle kicked in the door to make sure she was okay, only to discover that they were no longer in the house.\nGarret forced Destiny to hitchhike back to his hometown of Naughtly after attacking her with knives in the kitchen of Vivian\u2019s house. He threatened her with three separate knives. The first he cut her chin, scarring her, then threw the knife in the sink. He then grabbed a second knife and scarred her right over her heart, throwing the knife afterward into the sink. He escalated the altercation by grabbing a large knife and attempting to stab Destiny, when she broke free and grabbed the knife, scarring all of her fingers.\nPolice arrested Garret at his mother\u2019s house and he\u00a0was sent to jail under the instruction not to have any contact with Destiny and her family. He bypassed the order by sending letters to her addressed to her young daughter.\nVivian described her feelings towards the justice system after they struck a deal with Garett and failed to recognize the unborn child her daughter was carrying. Garret was sentenced to one year, and following his release, he began stalking Destiny and attempting to control her.\nAfter his release, there was another incident in Naughtly. Destiny had texted her brother, asking that he come pick her up, then shortly texted afterward saying everything was okay and not to come. He flagged that as suspicious and called his mom. RCMP arrived once again at Garret\u2019s house to find Destiny lying in Garret\u2019s bed, her face completely bruised. Their daughter sleeping in the next room, Garret was arrested again and charged with assault.\nDestiny was murdered at the age of 21. Her daughter was 2 at the time of her death.\nGarret\u2019s stalking continued and increase, but Destiny was trying to change her life and was pursuing a job around the BC/Yukon border. She received a text from Garret\u2019s mother\u2019s phone saying that he had died and she called her mom beside herself with emotion. Vivian encouraged her to continue on her path and do good for herself. She was supposed to be taking a trip to Prince George\nVivian recalled that they were using a lot of drugs and alcohol at the time, and Destiny had talked about going to a treatment centre, but the centre never returned her calls and her program stalled. She began drinking again.\nShe was supposed to be taking a trip to Prince George and Vivian thought she was seeing someone new. She was happy for her daughter, hoping that she turned a new leaf in her life when she discovered that her daughter was actually with Garret again in Naughtly.\nThat is when she got the news that they had found Destiny. She remembers the gut-wrenching scream from her husband when they found out about her daughter\u2019s death.\nDestiny had been at a party and there was an altercation. She was found lying in the snow and mud in the community, with no regard for her body. She was badly bruised and battered.\nAutopsy reports determined that Destiny was hit so hard that she was decapitated, but her head remained attached by flesh and tissue. Vivian recalls her open-casket funeral, where her face was heavily bruised and scarred, and her head was at an awkward angle. Vivian later found out why.\nGarret was arrested and charged again, sentenced to 8 years in prison where he remains today. Vivan told spectators about her journey to find God and how she was released from pain by forgiving Garret after thoughts of suicide and relapse.\nShe then commissioned a special headstone for Destiny with angel wings and a heart with her grad photo.\nVivian says that now her granddaughter is being bullied in the community and there is a lack of support systems for children left behind after victims of domestic violence or murder and she would like to see better programs in place. She says her granddaughter at the age of six first started talking about suicide and wanting to be with her mother. Vivian says after explaining to her granddaughter that if you take your own life you cannot be with God and mom in heaven, the young girl started to just wish she would die sooner.\nNow Cassidy is focused on becoming an RCMP office, so she can help other people and \u2018do good in the world.\n\nThe last testimony heard in the Friendship Centre was that of the family of Tamara Chipman.\nTom Chipman, Gladys Radek and Lorna Brown retold the story of Tamara\u2019s life and how it inspired their family to start the Highway of Tears Movement.\nTamara\u2019s dad Tom was the first to notice she was missing. He was away fishing at the time and after not hearing from her, which was not a usual thing as they had a strong relationship, he started to call around to his family asking if they had seen her.\nTamara\u2019s life had been in turmoil after her son Jaden was taken away due to a boating incident with his father where he was not properly secured and fell into the water at six months old. Tamara had been fighting for custody of her child, and previous to her disappearance she had regained that custody.\nLorna, Tamara\u2019s aunt, had Jaden temporarily while Tamara was fighting to get him back. Lorna explained that Tamara had been working really hard to get custody of her son and that it became a battle with the social worker, who Lorna said was exceptionally hard on Tamara.\nTamara was hitchhiking back and forth between Prince Rupert and Terrace because she was having car trouble. At the time of her disappearance her son was with her dad on his fishing boat, which is why he became immediately suspicious when he didn\u2019t hear from her because she would always check up on them.\nTamara\u2019s family described her relationship with Jaden\u2019s father, a known drug dealer who was 18 years older than her. They noticed that after she started dating Jaden\u2019s father Tamara started not showing up at family gatherings and was harder and harder to find. Lorna says that she feels if social services worked better with Tamara after Jaden was taken away, that she would have been able to get herself back together instead of feeling depleted, lost and turning to drugs to numb the pain.\nTamara has never been found. There are stories that circulate and tips that have come in about her whereabouts, but after investigations by the RCMP, the family and advocates on Vancouver\u2019s lower East side- nothing has turned up.\n12 years ago last week was the last time anyone had seen her.\nFlorence Naziel and Betty Joesph, cousins of the Chipman family, started a walk from Prince Rupert to a symposium in Prince George about missing women on the highway. They coined the term Highway of Tears and have now completed 7 walks to raise awareness for missing and murdered women along the highway and throughout Canada.\nGladys has walked from coast to coast. She walked right to the front doors of Parliment Hill and demanded the inquiry during the Harper government. During those walks she talked to thousands of families across the country about their loved ones, listing over 4000 women who have gone missing or ended up murdered.\nThey wrote 33 recommendations for the federal government to stop violence, including again better transportation services, shuttles for all First Nations communities, a better working relationship with the RCMP as well as an increase in patrolling along the highways.\nThe National Inquiry continues throughout today and tomorrow.\n\u00a0\nShare this:FacebookRedditPrintLinkedInTwitterGoogleTumblrLike this:Like Loading...\n\nRelated\n\n\n2017-09-27\nAshley Anthony\n\nShare !\n\n\ntweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAbout Ashley Anthony \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious: Roger Waters\nNext: Wildfires caused more than 127 million dollars in damage according to IBC\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMMIW: The story of Marlene and Doreen Jack\nSeptember 27, 2017\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNational Inquiry hosting artistic expression panel today, Kitsumkalum youth featured for \u2018The Highway\u2019\nSeptember 27, 2017\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMMIW Inquiry today in Smithers\nSeptember 26, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Air Now\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Live!\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeather Updates\n \n\n\n\nSocial Media\n CFNR NetworkDon't miss your chance to see this Canadian Music Icon who has been nominated for English songwriter, singer, solo artist, and producer of the year for the Canadian Folk Music Awards: Stephen Fearing Oct. 7th at 8pm.

He was arrested 16 months after Tina's body, wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down by rocks, was pulled from the Red River in central Winnipeg in 2014.\nShe had run away from a hotel \u2014 where she was being housed by Child and Family Services \u2014 and was being sexually exploited. Her death shocked the city and led the Manitoba government to phase out the use of hotels for kids in government care.\nCrown attorney James Ross laid out his theory for the jurors. He said Tina had a happy childhood and was raised by Favel on the Sagkeeng First Nation, a 90-minute drive northeast of Winnipeg.\nFavel said everything changed when Tina's father, who had cancer and was unable to care for her, was murdered in October 2011.\n\n\n\"It hurt her bad. She cried constantly,\" Favel testified.\nTina got a tattoo with her father's name, a pair of angel wings, and his dates of birth and death, she said.\n\n\nTina's mother, who had not been part of her life, re-emerged after that and Tina found out she had younger siblings, Favel said. That led Tina to go to Winnipeg to visit her mother for what was supposed to be one week in late June 2014.\nFavel told court she had given Tina a pre-paid phone card, didn't hear from her and called around trying to find her.\n\"I called the police. I called (Child and Family Services), but nobody found her.\"\nBy that time, Ross said, Tina had fallen into street life and was being sexually exploited.\nRoss told jurors they will hear evidence from Cormier's friends, as well as from wiretaps of Cormier's apartment, that he killed the teenager because he was worried he might be arrested.\n\"There will be evidence from Mr. Cormier's associates that he and Tina had a bad falling out ... that ended with her threatening to report him to the police,\" Ross said.\nCormier has a sexual interest in Tina and later was angry upon finding out she was only 15 \u2014 one year below the age of consent, Ross said.\n\"Mr. Cormier told associates that Tina Fontaine 'got killed because we, I, found out she was 15.'\"\nRoss also said Cormier was worried Tina was going to report him for possessing a stolen truck \u2014 the same one the Crown believes was used to transport her body to the river.\nAutopsy results said Tina's body weighed just 77 pounds when it was found. Favel descibed her as a small girl who looked younger than her age.\nHer body was weighed down in the river by rocks, which kept it from surfacing for days, Ross said.\nThe long time in the water means there is no DNA evidence for the trial.\n\"Simply put, time and the river washed away any evidence there was on the body or the duvet cover.\"\nNote to readers: CORRECTS weight of body para 20\nBy Steve Lambert, The Canadian Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGirl killed because of underage sex: Crown\n\nNews\n05:09 PM\n\n\n\nWINNIPEG \u2014 The voice of a slain 15-year-old girl echoed through a courtroom Monday more than three years after her death renewed calls for a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women.\n\"Hey, um, I'd like to report a blue truck that was stolen earlier today,\" Tina Fontaine said in a 911 call played at the trial of the man accused of killing her.\nShe was told to call the police non-emergency line.\n\"That was Tina,\" Thelma Favel, the great-aunt who raised her, testified as she sobbed deeply.\nMonday marked the opening of a second-degree murder trial for Raymond Cormier, 55.

He was arrested 16 months after Tina's body, wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down by rocks, was pulled from the Red River in central Winnipeg in 2014.\nShe had run away from a hotel \u2014 where she was being housed by Child and Family Services \u2014 and was being sexually exploited. Her death shocked the city and led the Manitoba government to phase out the use of hotels for kids in government care.\nCrown attorney James Ross laid out his theory for the jurors. He said Tina had a happy childhood and was raised by Favel on the Sagkeeng First Nation, a 90-minute drive northeast of Winnipeg.\nFavel said everything changed when Tina's father, who had cancer and was unable to care for her, was murdered in October 2011.\n\"It hurt her bad. She cried constantly,\" Favel testified.\nTina got a tattoo with her father's name, a pair of angel wings, and his dates of birth and death, she said.\n\n\nTina's mother, who had not been part of her life, re-emerged after that and Tina found out she had younger siblings, Favel said.

week.\nKathleen Martens\nAPTN News\nPersistent and deadly violence against Indigenous women and girls is a form of \u201ccolonial genocide,\u201d concludes the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG).\nThe word genocide is contained throughout the 116-page executive summary of the final report sent to APTN News Friday.\nThe final report entitled Reclaiming Power And Place is scheduled to be made public Monday in Gatineau, Que., but parts of it have been leaked to media outlets, including APTN.\nRead the executive summary here: Reclaiming Power and Place\nThe inquiry declined to comment on the leaks, as did federal politicians, who are expected to be on hand with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the closing ceremony.\nHowever, Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, agrees with the inquiry\u2019s conclusion.\n\u201c(He) has said many times that the treatment of First Nations in Canada is consistent with the definition of genocide based on the many assaults on First Nations people and cultures,\u201d a spokesman for Bellegarde said Friday.\n\u201cThe violence and homicide against Indigenous women and girls is part of this pattern and governments need to work urgently with Indigenous people to stop it.\u201d\nThe four government-appointed commissioners who helmed the inquiry, say in the summary they agreed on, the concept of genocide early on in their work, which began in September 2016.\nThey say they use it in their report to build on the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\u201cThe truths shared in these National Inquiry hearings tell the story \u2013 or, more accurately, thousands of stories \u2013 of acts of\u00a0 genocide against First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA (two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex and asexual)\u00a0people,\u201d they write.\n\u201cThis violence amounts to a race-based genocide of Indigenous Peoples, including First Nations, Inuit, and M\u00e9tis, which especially targets women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people.\n\u201cThis genocide has been empowered by colonial structures, evidenced notably by the Indian Act, the Sixties Scoop, residential schools, and breaches of human and Inuit, M\u00e9tis and First Nations rights, leading directly to the current increased rates of violence, death, and suicide in Indigenous populations.\u201d\nThey say they rely on this definition of genocide: \u201c\u2026a co-ordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves.\u201d\nAnd, they note, Canada officially recognizes five genocides: the Holocaust, the Holodomor genocide, the Armenian genocide in 1915, the Rwandan genocide of 1994, and the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995.\nThis indicates they may ask the government to recognize a sixth genocide on Monday.\nThe summary blames \u201csettler colonialist structures\u201d and \u201cintergenerational effects of genocide\u201d for perpetuating and encouraging the ongoing violence.\n\u201cAs many witnesses expressed, this country is at war, and Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people are under siege,\u201d it says, noting the high crime rate against this group.\n\u201cPerpetrators of violence include Indigenous and non-Indigenous family members and partners, casual acquaintances, and serial killers.\u201d\nHowever, the inquiry says it was unable to learn how many Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA people \u201chave been lost to the Canadian genocide to date.\u201d\nThe commissioners agree: \u201cThousands of women\u2019s deaths or disappearances have likely gone unrecorded over the decades, and many families likely did not feel ready or safe to share with the National Inquiry before our timelines required us to close registration.\n\u201cWithout a doubt there are many more.\u201d\nThe summary says more than 2,380 people participated in the inquiry. And, to a person, it says their words told the pain of colonial violence, racism and oppression.\n\u201cColonial violence, as well as racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people, has become embedded in everyday life \u2013 whether this is through interpersonal forms of violence, through institutions like the health care system and the justice system, or in the laws, policies and structures of Canadian society,\u201d it says.\n\u201cThe result has been that many Indigenous people have grown up normalized to violence, while Canadian society shows an appalling apathy to addressing the issue. The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls finds that this amounts to genocide.\u201d\nThe final report is 1,200 pages.\nThe contents of this story may be triggering to

As evidence of the threat that terrorism now poses to\nthe country, Harper and his ruling Conservatives have\ncited two domestic terror attacks in Canada last year as well as December\n2014\u2019s hostage-taking in Sydney, Australia.\nCritics say that the legislation, Bill\nC-51, would bring Canada dangerously close to becoming a totalitarian\nstate. \u00a0Indigenous rights advocate Holly Jarrett\ndescribes the bill as \u201cpropaganda.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it is,\u201d Jarrett tells me over\nthe phone, \u201cAnd this, in my opinion, is another one of his ploys to pull away\nattention and let the tail wag the dog.\u201d\nC-51 is a vaguely worded, 62-page long bill\nthat will dramatically increase the powers of the Canadian Security\nIntelligence Services (CSIS) while requiring minimal oversight. The bill will\ninstitute a culture of secrecy around multiple police and government activities\ndeemed to have bearing on national security, and in the words of security law\nexpert Craig\nForcese, press Canada\u2019s judges into the service of this culture, turning\nthem into \u201cenablers of illegality.\u201d\nMany people believe that the bill will also\nhave a chilling effect on the work of Indigenous rights advocates,\nenvironmental protesters, and anyone advocating views contrary to the ruling\ngovernment\u2019s agenda.\n Bill C-51 Day of Action in Bridgewater. Photo: John McCarthy via Flickr.Francois Lavigne began his career with the\nRCMP, eventually joining CSIS following their inception in 1984. In an\ninterview with right-leaning newspaper the National Post, even Lavigne said the\nbill is unnecessary.\n\n\u201cI find it a little\nconvenient that in the past few years that these radicalized people are the\nbiggest threat to ever hit us,\u201d Lavigne stated. \u201cThere are more people dying\nbecause of drunk drivers or because of gang violence.\u201d\nOr due to institutionalized racism.\nJarrett agrees that the bill could further\nmarginalize Canada\u2019s Indigenous people:\n\n\u201cOur activists are our voices, right? \u2026If we stifle the progress they could\nmake then he\u2019s just taking away from our voices again,\u201d she says, referring to\nPrime Minister Harper.\nIn the autumn of 2014, Holly Jarrett\nuploaded a\nvideo of herself wherein she tells Canadians that while Aboriginal women\nmake up 3.4% of the country\u2019s population, they have accounted for a staggering\n24% of murder victims in Canada over the last 30 years. In the video Jarrett\nalso honours her own murdered cousin, Loretta\nSaunders. Like Jarrett, Saunders was an Inuk woman from Labrador. At the\ntime she was murdered, Saunders was completing her honours thesis at Dalhousie\nUniversity in Halifax; the topic of her thesis was missing and murdered\nIndigenous women. Campus protest 2011. Photo: Toban B via Flickr.\nIn a question that became the title of a\nviral social\nmedia campaign, Jarrett invites viewers to contemplate\nthe question that plagues Canada\u2019s Indigenous women: \u201cAm I next?\u201d\u00a0The video also directs viewers to Jarrett\u2019s\nchange.org\npetition, asking the Canadian government to hold an inquiry into missing\nand murdered Indigenous women.\u00a0With much of the discourse around the bill\nfocusing on its potential effects on environmental activism, I asked Jarrett if\nthe bill would further imperil the safety of Indigenous women in Canada.\u00a0\n\u201cWell, yes, when we talk about missing and murdered Indigenous women, there\u2019s\nno one topic. Just like what the government does, they encompass everything\u2026\nYou can\u2019t touch one of these without touching a million more of them.\u201d\nIn a year-end interview between Canadian\nPrime Minister Stephen Harper and CBC anchor Peter Mansbridge in 2014, Mansbridge\nasked the prime minister to comment on some suggestion that his government was finally\nconsidering holding the inquiry so many have asked for. Harper replied that the\nproblem \u201c\u2026isn\u2019t really high on our radar, to be honest.\u201d\n***\nSo what is high on Harper\u2019s radar?\u00a0With an election scheduled for October of\nthis year, Harper and his fellow Conservative ministers are intent on passing\nBill C-51, employing a hard-sell approach that speaks directly to Canadians\u2019\ngeopolitical anxieties, and simmering concerns over threats from \u201chome-grown\nterror.\u201d The PR offensive has been supplemented with an aggressive internal\ncampaign to move the bill through parliament with minimal\npublic consultation and formal review, employing what former CSIS officer\nLavigne has\ncalled \u201cfascist techniques.\u201d\nCSIS would also acquire the permission to\n\u201cdisrupt\u201d suspected terror activity both within and outside of Canada.\nBackground documents cited\nby the CBC included the examples of obstructing travel plans or financial\ntransactions, or interfering with the websites and social media accounts of\nsuspected radicals. The legislation itself does not include a definition of\nwhat \u201cdisruption\u201d might include, meaning the exact nature of any disruptive\nactivity will remain open to interpretation if the bill is adopted.\nMuch of the threat that is posed by C-51 is\ntied to the vagaries of its language. Presently, law enforcement agencies are\npermitted to arrest someone if they believe a terrorist attack \u201cwill be carried\nout.\u201d Bill C-51 would change\nthis to permit arrest if officials believe a terrorist attack \u201cmay be\ncarried out.\u201d\nWhile it is against the law to encourage\nsomeone to commit a specific\nterrorism offence, another change would make it punishable by up to five\nyears in prison to promote terrorism or intentionally advocate it. At the same\ntime, government officials are insisting that they are not making it illegal to\nglorify terrorism.\nExactly what behaviour defines a terrorist\nin Canada is by no means clear. In February when reporters\nasked Justice Minister Peter Mackay how terrorism would be defined in\nregards to the legislation, his reply was petulant: \u201cLook it up.\u201d\n\nFurther research into the Conservatives\u2019 rhetoric only complicates matters.\nAfter a plot for a mass shooting in a Nova Scotia mall was discovered and\nfoiled, Mackay\nwas quick to clarify that this was not an act of terrorism because, he\nasserted, the planned attack did not appear to have been \u201cculturally\nmotivated.\u201d Dare we ask how Mackay defines a cultural motivation?\nLast year\u2019s tragic attacks were both\nconducted by a lone perpetrator, and both perpetrators had been identified by\nauthorities as persons of interest who had been radicalized.\nHowever it has also been alleged that the Parliament Hill shooter, who is known\nto have had a history of crack addiction, was mentally\nunwell too. This suggests that the attacker\u2019s radicalisation was one among\na host of factors likely to have influenced the man\u2019s behaviour. \n\nRegardless of the perpetrators\u2019 motivations, statistically speaking Canadians\nare fortunate to live in a country where the threat of such terrorist attacks\nremains at a very low level. Perhaps more important than this, though, is the\nfact that there are some Canadians for whom Canada itself is the threat.\nAccording to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police\u2019s own report,\nAboriginal women represent 16% of Canada\u2019s murdered women, and 11.3% of its\nmissing females cases.\n***\nBill C-51 has sparked protests\nacross the country, and it has also been denounced in a\nletter signed by four former Canadian prime ministers as well as five\nformer Supreme Court justices.\nThe official opposition New Democratic\nParty has\nstated it will not support the bill, while the center-left Liberal Party\nwill vote in favour of the legislation. Considered strong contenders in the\nupcoming election, the Liberals have qualified\ntheir support, proposing changes to the bill, and stating that if elected they\nwould introduce \u201crobust oversight and appropriate review.\u201d\nIn an open letter to the Prime Minister,\nsigned by over 100\nCanadian law professors, the bill was described as a \u201cdangerous piece of\nlegislation.\u201d Missing Women Inquiry protest, Vancouver 2011. Photo: Wayne G via Flickr.\nDr. Pamela Palmater is a Mi\u2019kmaw lawyer and\nprofessor, and a member of the Eel River Bar First Nation in New Brunswick.\nPalmater holds the chair in Indigenous Governance at Ryerson University in\nToronto, and is a high-profile advocate for Indigenous rights.\nOn March 24, Palmater\nappeared as a witness before Parliament in the House of Commons\u2019 Public\nSafety Committee hearings to obtain feedback on Bill C-51. In her testimony\nPalmater argued forcefully for the bill to be thrown out, stating that under\nC-51 Indigenous people\u2019s ability to advocate for their rights and protest\nagainst laws could constitute insurgency. Underscoring her point, Palmater\nreminded the committee that there was a time when it was legal in Canada \u201c\u2026to\ntake Mi\u2019kmaq scalps\u201d and to confine Indigenous people to reserves.\n\u201cWe had to break the law in order to\npreserve our lives, our physical security and our identities, and are faced\nwith that same problem again in C-51.\u201d\nPalmater is an advocate for Indigenous\nnationhood and she has said that she could easily fall afoul of C-51.\n\n\u201cMy declaration of sovereignty \u2013 that kind of material on my computer \u2013 could\nbe considered terrorism, a threat to national security because it\u2019s a threat to\nCanada\u2019s national security,\u201d she testified.\u00a0\nPalmater\u2019s testimony is based on more than\nspeculation. In an\ninterview with the CTV News program Question Period two days before\ntestifying against the bill, Palmater was asked to comment on the repeated\ninsistence of Canada\u2019s Public Safety Minister Stephen Blaney that the bill\nwould not pave the way for CSIS or the RCMP to spy on high-profile advocates\nlike her.\nSmiling, Palmater replied \u201c\u2026They are\nalready spying on me. They are already spying on people like Cindy Blackstock,\na social worker for Pete\u2019s sake. I mean, I wrote an access to information\nrequest to CSIS, to National Defence, to the RCMP and (government office)\nIndian Affairs to confirm whether or not they\u2019re following, monitoring,\nsurveilling me in any way, and three out of the group all confirmed that they\nwere. So right now without this anti-terrorism bill, my rights are already\nbeing violated.\u201d\nIn a blog\nabout the bill posted to activism website rabble.ca, Palmater is blunt in\nher explanation of the legislation\u2019s potential threat to all Canadians:\n\u201cCanadians will, for the first time, be\ntreated like First Nations people \u2013 without the protection of their basic\nrights, freedoms and liberties. Even someone who retweets or reposts a comment\nmade by someone else on Facebook could potentially be captured under this\nsweeping legislation.\u201d\nThinking of this, I asked Holly Jarrett how\nthe Am I Next campaign might look if it were begun under Bill C-51.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to speculate and to be\nhonest with you\u2026I try not to speculate too much because I try to deal in the\n\u2018now\u2019 when I\u2019m campaigning. But had this bill been in effect I possibly could\nhave been charged for speaking out against our government. I possibly could have\nbeen charged with speaking about any kind of an act that would\u2026lead to an\nuprising kind of event.\u00a0\n\u201cSo, then we\u2019ve got women who are taking\ntheir picture for that whole campaign, and what would we have done? Would we\nhave said \u2018you can\u2019t do this because that\u2019s a terrorist act?\u2019\u2026I know that it\u2019s\na serious thing and I don\u2019t want this to sound ignorant, but some of the things\nthat Harper does, they\u2019re just laughable.\n\u201cAll those women who would have been in my\ncampaign would have been able to be possibly investigated with special police\nservices on their tail. Like we don\u2019t have enough already, you know?\u201d\nIf Harper has his way, all Canadians might find\nthemselves with an unsettling new reason to be looking over their shoulder.\u00a0 \n\n\n \n\n\n\nAbout the author\nElizabeth Grant is an artist and freelance\nwriter who recently completed the Masters of Letters in Fine Art Practice at\nthe Glasgow School of Art.\nShe was a finalist for the RBC Canadian\nPainting Competition, and has been supported by the Canada Council for the\nArts, and the Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation.

marking the release of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women report in Gatineau on June 3, 2019. Aboriginal civilian groups that would oversee police actions are long past due in Canada, says a commissioner who served on the inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichele Audette says it\u2019s been obvious for decades that the way police are held accountable is failing Indigenous people and other communities of colour.\u201cIt is urgent, very urgent, that we have a civilian body,\u201d Audette said in an interview with The Canadian Press from Montreal.For three years,\u00a0Audette listened to testimony from Indigenous families and experts.\u00a0She recalls stories about crime victims not being supported or families not taken seriously when a loved one disappeared. Some spoke about not knowing where to turn if they alleged police were the perpetrators of harm.WATCH: NDP Leah Gazan pushes for Missing and Murder Indigenous Women and Girls action plan. Story continues below.\u00a0The inquiry\u2019s final report was delivered to the federal government in June 2019. It included 231 \u201ccalls for justice\u201d \u2014\u00a0many of which included police reform and increased oversight.It urged federal and provincial governments to establish Indigenous civilian bodies in all jurisdictions to oversee investigations into cases involving Indigenous people.Nothing happened, Audette said.A spokesman for Public Safety Canada, which is responsible for policing and police oversight, said the government is working to address the inquiry\u2019s report and there have been meetings with Indigenous leaders about Indigenous policing.It is urgent, very urgent, that we have a civilian body.Michele Audette\u201cWhile still early days, it can be expected that questions around effective civilian police oversight and the relationship between Canada\u2019s Indigenous population and police services will surface and will need to be carefully assessed as work progresses on this mandate commitment,\u201d Tim Warmington said in an email.Ian McLeod, a federal Justice Department spokesman who could not speak to police oversight specifically, said there is a lot more work to do when it comes to supporting Indigenous people.\u201cWe will continue working with First Nations, Inuit and Metis people, and with provincial, territorial and municipal partners to respond to the (inquiry\u2019s) calls for justice,\u201d he said in an email.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarryl Dyck/THE CANADIAN PRESSKrystine Kelsall bears her handprint in paint on her face while participating in a march calling for justice for missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, on Oct. 20, 2019. There are specialized services for Indigenous victims and the government also provides support to community-based programs and family liaison units, McLeod said.Audette said the tide has started to turn with rallies demanding police reform after the death of George Floyd, a Black man in the United States. A police officer trying to arrest Floyd knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes, even as Floyd said he couldn\u2019t breathe.There are many recent stories about Indigenous people dying during encounters with police.Three Indigenous people \u2014\u00a0Eishia Hudson, 16, Jason Collins, 36, and Stewart Andrews, 22\u00a0\u2014 were killed by Winnipeg officers over a 10-day span in April. The province\u2019s independent police watchdog is investigating.\nRELATED\n\n                Scheer, Tory MPs Heckled At Rally Defending John A.

Her family criticized Ontario\u2019s Special Investigation Unit for clearing the officers of wrongdoing and its finding of no \u201covert racism\u201d in their actions. Of that unit\u2019s 52 investigators, two are Indigenous and three are Black.In June, two Indigenous people died in encounters with police in New Brunswick, including 26-year-old Chantel Moore, who was shot after officers were called to do a wellness check. Quebec\u2019s independent investigation unit was brought in to look at the circumstances of Moore\u2019s death.Not a single investigator in that unit is Indigenous.WATCH: Residential schools in Canada formally recognized as historic sites. Story continues below.\u00a0Audette said it shows the need for Indigenous oversight of such investigations.\u201cEven if you are a good person, it\u2019s just the structure, the culture and \u2026 systemic discrimination or racism,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s break this by having a civilian body.\u201dGrand Chief Arlen Dumas of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs said First Nations people in his province have been calling for reform for decades. He pointed to the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry, which investigated the brutal murder of Helen Betty Osborne near The Pas in 1971 and the fatal Winnipeg police shooting of John Joseph Harper in 1988.The shooting of Harper was originally ruled an accident, but the inquiry said the officer used excessive force.Even if you are a good person, it\u2019s just the structure, the culture and \u2026 systemic discrimination or racism.Michele AudetteNo one was convicted in Osborne\u2019s death for 16 years. It was concluded that the most significant factors prolonging the young Cree woman\u2019s case were racism, sexism and indifference of white people.\u201cFundamentally, the missing piece is there is not enough of a political will and there\u2019s not enough of a desire for the institutions to truly address these issues,\u201d Dumas said.He said he must remain hopeful the current push for police reform will finally lead to action.\u201cThe only recourse, really, is to have an independent objective First Nations perspective on oversight of these issues.\u201dThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 7, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggest a correction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly Geraldine Malone\n\nThe Canadian Press\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE: news politics indigenous people police Missing and murdered indigenous women Michele Audette\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Trending\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDenis Shapovalov Makes History For Canada At U.S. Open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Increase In Daily COVID-19 Cases \u2018A Concern\u2019: Tam\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommissioner Calls For Indigenous Oversight Of Canada\u2019s Police\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrca Who Carried Dead Calf For More Than 2 Weeks Gives Birth Again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictims Of Oshawa, Ont.

We can not make empty promises and walk away because those families heard every word.Manitoba Premier Greg Selinger says he agrees that provinces shouldn't wait for the inquiry and they should work together now to do what they can. \"Particularly well-being supports for families and communities\".\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d1onseille\n\nKadyrov Publishes Russian Oppositioner Yashin's Damning Report \nGeorge R.R.

June 3 marks the anniversary of the 2021 Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People National Action Plan, and the knowledge that the families of Tessa, Doris, and Rebecca, among so many others, face a lifetime without their loved ones begs the question \u2014 where is the action?When the National Family and Survivors Circle was asked to contribute to the National Action Plan, we recognized the potential significance of the document. Here was a long overdue opportunity to develop solutions to a genocide that has been allowed to continue for decades by the state, to reaffirm how all governments (including Indigenous governments), institutions, organizations, industries, and individuals are responsible for fulfilling the 231 Calls for Justice from the Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, and to fully include family members and survivors in the development of Indigenous-led, decolonized policies and pathways for transformative change. What people are reading             The surprising truth about gun deaths in Canada By Sandy Garossino\u00a0|\u00a0Opinion\u00a0| June 2nd 2022      But a year later, it is still difficult to track how many of the 231 Calls for Justice have been fulfilled, leading to valid fears that enough isn\u2019t being done.The 231 \"Calls for Justice are interconnected legal imperatives; they are not optional.\" However, there is currently no mechanism to track progress on their fulfillment despite many of them, including Calls for Justice 1.5, 1.7, 1.10, and 5.24, specifically citing the need for accountability measures and improved data collection to be in place immediately.This is not just shameful \u2014 it\u2019s dangerous. Each day of inaction results in the tragic loss of human life and further violence, with an alarmingly disproportionate number of Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people being murdered, harmed, or going missing. A recent Statistics Canada report confirmed what we\u2019ve known for decades \u2014 that while Indigenous women represent approximately five per cent of women in Canada, they represent almost one-quarter (24 per cent) of all women homicide victims between 2015 and 2020. In addition, more than six in 10 Indigenous women experience either physical or sexual assault in their lifetimes.  June 3 marks the anniversary of the 2021 Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People National Action Plan. Where is the action? asks @Handersonpyrz. #MMIWG2S #DayofAction #231CallsforJustice #TimeForAction #PoliticalWill      The need for accountability is more urgent than ever to address this national crisis. It must start with political will. All governments and institutions must be held accountable to their responsibility to the 231 Calls for Justice. These are legal imperatives. Political will ensures concrete actions, clear timelines, and measurable outcomes to implement the National Action Plan. These obligations include fulfilling Call for Justice 1.7, which demands federal, provincial, and territorial governments (in partnership with Indigenous Peoples) establish a national Indigenous and human rights ombudsperson and a national Indigenous and human rights tribunal. This will begin providing the oversight necessary to ensure the 231 Calls for Justice are being accomplished using a decolonized approach that recognizes human, inherent, and treaty rights.Accountability doesn\u2019t just end with governments. Every Canadian has a responsibility to ensure the safety and protection of Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people. Call for Justice 15.8 calls on all Canadians to help hold all governments accountable to act on the 231 Calls for Justice, and to implement them according to the important principles that were set out in the final report.That report stated, \u201cThe steps to end and redress this genocide must be no less monumental than the combination of systems and actions that has worked to maintain colonial violence for generations.\u201d We remind Canadians that the steps to ending race- and gender-based violence and genocide exist. Without concrete timelines, resource commitments, and accountability measures, the National Action Plan will simply remain a hopeful framework rather than a mechanism to achieve transformative change.Ultimately, we as Canadians are all responsible for holding systems and society accountable and taking action to keep Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people safe and protected. It is more critical than ever for today to be a Day of Action to redress and urgently implement the National Action Plan and the 231 Calls for Justice. This will build pathways for future generations, so they do not have to endure the same violence and harms that thousands of victims and their families have experienced.Anything less will perpetuate the genocide, gender-based violence, and the human cost faced by Indigenous women, girls, 2SLGBTQQIA+ people, families, and survivors.Hilda Anderson-Pyrz is the chair of the National Family and Survivors Circle, which is comprised of Indigenous women and 2SLGBTQQIA+ families and survivors who use their lived experience and expertise to advocate and provide guidance on pathways for the full inclusion of families and survivors in the work to end gender- and race-based violence. For the past 20 years, Anderson-Pyrz has been a fierce and tireless advocate for ending gender- and race-based violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people.

(Photo: Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press)\"Family members, loved ones have been waiting for decades to be heard,\"\nNWAC's president Francyne Joe said in a statement.\"We recognize that it's a big task to start a national inquiry but the lack of communication has been disappointing and worrying.\"Part of the problem, Buller said, was in the way the\u00a0inquiry was announced this summer, leading people to \"mistakenly believe\" sessions would start immediately.\n\u201cFamily members, loved ones have been waiting for decades to be heard.\u201d\"That's\u00a0unfortunate that happened,\" she said.\"Those expectations were built inappropriately and unfortunately. However, when you look at the start times ... for other inquiries and other commissions, we are actually doing very, very well.\"Inquiry headquarters opening soonThe\u00a0five\u00a0commissioners are\u00a0now in the process of\u00a0hiring staff and have named an executive director: Michele Moreau, the executive director of the Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice.The inquiry headquarters will open in Vancouver next week, Buller added, noting this will likely serve as a temporary space\u00a0because there are plans to move on to reserve land in Metro Vancouver.\"That's where we belong,\" she said.Buller, the first female First Nations judge in British Columbia, also\u00a0said the commissioners are giving a lot of thought to the\u00a0hearings because\u00a0they will involve speaking with \"real people\" who are hurting.\nWomen hold images of murdered and missing indigenous women during a rally for missing and murdered indigenous women in Ottawa on Oct. 4. (Photo: Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)She said she can\u00a0assure the families they are carefully putting together a process that will achieve the goal of doing no harm.\"We are borrowing from the medical profession but we really want to ensure that our process supports the families before, during and after the time that they spend with us telling us their stories,\" she said.\"Also, we want to make sure we are culturally appropriate because indigenous cultures across Canada are radically different from each other.\"Families will be given options on how to participate in the inquiry process, she noted, including the chance to speak publicly at community gatherings or in private sessions.\n\u201cWe want to make sure we are culturally appropriate because indigenous cultures across Canada are radically different from each other.\u201dThe hearings are not expected to start until early 2017, with an interim report due in November of next year.\"I have no doubt that the whole world is watching but I work with a wonderful team of commissioners and we share the load,\" Buller said.\"We are all mindful of public scrutiny ...

Bear's body has never been found.\u00a0\u00a0(THE CANADIAN PRESS)\u00a0\u00a0By The Canadian PressMon., Sept. 19, 2016REGINA\u2014A Regina man has pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of two aboriginal women who disappeared three years ago.Clayton Eichler\u2019s trial was to begin Monday on charges of first-degree murder in the deaths of Kelly Goforth and Richele Bear, but instead he entered the guilty plea.Court heard Goforth\u2019s body was found in a Dumpster, wrapped in garbage bags and then put in a hockey bag.Crown prosecutor Bill Burge said Goforth was strangled and DNA led investigators to Eichler.Burge said a search of Eichler\u2019s home then turned up photos of Bear with marks around her neck, although her body has not been found.Article Continued BelowThe Crown and defence have made a joint submission that Eichler serve 20 years of his automatic life sentence before being eligible for parole.\u201cThere was a path to first degree. It wasn\u2019t a dead certain path, but there was a path that met the test for prosecution. There were risks and we felt this was a compromise we could live with and that\u2019s why we took the plea to second-degree,\u201d said Burge.Victim impact statements are scheduled to be heard Tuesday in Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Regina before sentencing.Two indigenous groups issued a news release in advance of the trial supporting the women\u2019s families.The File Hills Qu\u2019Appelle Tribal Council and the Regina Treaty-Status Indian Services office said the women, both in their early 20s, were valued daughters, sisters, aunts, nieces, granddaughters, cousins and friends.Goforth was also the mother of a young son.\u201cThere will be aspects of Kelly and Richele\u2019s lifestyles that will be exposed to the public,\u201d the release said. \u201cIt is the responsibility of all of us as citizens to understand the realities and the vulnerabilities of our indigenous women are due to the immense poverty that is often faced by our indigenous people in the cities.\u201cAs such, indigenous women are forced to put themselves at greater risk for harm.\u201dThe release said women should never expect \u201cthat any lifestyle choice should make them a target for predators to hurt them or end their lives.\u201dThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star & PartnersLOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a024\u00b0CloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsDamon Wayans on why you\u2019ll likely watch \u2018Lethal Weapon\u2019 the TV showDebuting Sept. 21 on City, show is a remake of the violent but hugely successful global franchise that paired Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as an out-of-sync pair of detectives.

Jeremy Skibicki is behind bars charged with four counts of first-degree murder.The remains of Rebecca Contois, one of the women Skibicki is alleged to have killed, were discovered in the Brady Road Landfill earlier this year, while WPS said they believe the remains of victims Morgan Harris and Mercedes Myran are in the Prairie Green Landfill near Stony Mountain.Skibicki is also accused of killing a fourth woman who remains unidentified and who community members have been referring to as Buffalo Woman.And as Indigenous women and girls in Manitoba and across Canada continue to deal with disproportionally high rates of violence and abuse, Harris told students on Monday that it is up to all people of all backgrounds and ages to \u201cget involved\u201d with the issue, and she said that could involve doing things and going places that would take some out of their \u201ccomfort zone.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to talk about being an ally, but it\u2019s another thing to actually be one,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBe present, volunteer at shelters so you can see the troubles some of our people face. Then you can get to know them and understand why they got to where they did.\u201dShe also called on non-Indigenous students to educate themselves about Indigenous issues, and some of the challenges that Indigenous people face and have faced over generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMany people only see what society calls the ugly side, but many fail to realize that as Indigenous people we are so much more. Go to celebrations and pow-wows where you can experience the culture,\u201d Harris said.\u201cMost importantly, if you are unsure ask questions respectfully. Understand, acknowledge and listen to what we have to say, so that we may find a way to help you understand.\u201dHarris called for Canadians to do more to push elected officials to find ways to keep Indigenous women and girls safe and free from abuse and violence.\u201cWrite letters to the government, and put pressure on them to protect Indigenous people,\u201d Harris said.She said she also believes young people have to learn to have \u201cdifficult conversations\u201d about some of the issues facing Indigenous people in Canada.\u201cTalk about this with other people, your peers, and acknowledge what is happening, it really is that simple,\u201d she said.\u201cAnd if it is uncomfortable for you to speak about it, then just imagine how uncomfortable it is for an Indigenous person to live through every day.\u201dSaturday marked the fourth anniversary of the release of Reclaiming Power and Place: The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\u2014 Dave Baxter is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter who works out of the Winnipeg Sun.

That sparked rallies across the country.\t\t\t Another murder left the small group of family and friends utterly devastated.\t\t\t Last year, 29-year-old Jeanenne Fontaine, Tina's cousin and a mother of three, was shot dead. Her body was found in her home which had been set ablaze. Three men have been charged.\t\t\t \"When you hear the statistics, you don't really put two and two together \u2026 but a personal story like that, where four out of a dozen kids (are killed), look at the statistics on that,\" Stevenson said.\t\t\t \"Four of a dozen kids will not make it given the way things are right now \u2014 the racism, the foster-care system, all of the systems that are continuing to fail.\"\t\t\t On the first anniversary of Jeanenne Fontaine's murder, two of the children who have grown into adults, Angel and Rose Fontaine, wanted to hold a smudge. Five members from the childhood friendship group gathered at the centre where they used to spend their carefree summer days.\t\t\t They prayed, shared food, drummed and supported each other.\t\t\t \"It turned into a spontaneous sharing circle and then, after that sharing circle, we decided to do another one and another one and another one,\" Stevenson said.\t\t\t The group has picked up a few other members. Some are family but others are people from the community who also need to heal. No one is turned away.\t\t\t As it came closer to August and the fourth anniversary of the discovery of Tina's body, they decided to host a special potluck.\t\t\t In a post on Facebook, Katie Fontaine said everything is done in cycles of four to honour the four directions. The anniversary marked \"a time to usher in healing for our family.\"\t\t\t \"A feast brings community together so they can help you heal.\"\t\t\t Stevenson isn't sure what the future is for Tina's surviving relatives. For now, they will continue to meet every month to offer each other support.\t\t\t She hopes it will grow into a larger movement like the Bear Clan Patrol, a neighbourhood watch group that started after the girl's death.\t\t\t \"It's nothing special \u2014 just showing support to each other, being there, using your time and your skills, being a good helper. I'm doing things that an auntie would do, checking on people, making sure they are OK,\" Stevenson said.\t\t\t \"We can't wait around for someone to help us. We just have to use the tools that we know \u2014 smudging, drumming, sharing, sharing a meal.\"\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAdvertise With Us\n\n\n\n\nReport Error\nSubmit a Tip\nRefundRefund\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tYou can comment on most stories on The Brandon Sun website.

But, the inquiry itself was, in part, a response to more than 3,000 families who have lost a daughter, a sister, a mother ...\n\"Modern Canadian policies perpetuate ... colonial legacies and have resulted in clear patterns of violence and marginalization of Indigenous peoples, particularly women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA (two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex and asexual),\u201d states a supplement to the 1,250-page, two-volume main report.\n\u201cThe Canadian state was founded on colonial genocidal policies that are inextricably linked to Canada\u2019s contemporary relationship with Indigenous peoples.\u201d\nIn other words, our past haunts our present, but this report offers hope that it need not shape our future.\nThe report traces the history of Canadian colonization, citing examples like the bounty on Mi\u2019kmaq scalps in the 1750s; the annihilation of the Beothuk in Newfoundland; and a policy to starve First Nations\u2019 people off their land to push through the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nThe national disgrace that was the residential school system forcibly removed Indigenous children from their families and held them in often brutal captivity, where the explicit goal was to \u201ckill the Indian in the child.\u201d In thousands of cases, they killed the child.\n\u201cThese historical policies are appalling in their systematic destruction of Indigenous communities, but what is more appalling is that many of these policies continue today under a different guise,\u201d says the report.\nThe inquiry finds these policies in inadequate police protection for Indigenous women and girls, in the over-apprehension of Indigenous children by the child-welfare system and in the enduring racism that is the legacy of centuries of dehumanizing official policy and action.\nIt\u2019s in that context that the inquiry concluded the national tragedy of thousands of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls is the result of genocide.\nGenocide, according to the UN Convention, is the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, through any of the following means: Killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group or, forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\nWhether non-Indigenous Canadians want to acknowledge it or not, Canada, through its history, has overtly or covertly committed each of these crimes against First Nations\u2019 people.\n\u201cWe all have to get past the guilt and shame,\u201d says an elder quoted in the final report, and the inquiry\u2019s chief commissioner Marion Buller says that begins by recognizing the truth.\n\u201cFor non-Indigenous Canadians, this means rethinking commonly held stereotypes, and confronting racism in every context. For Indigenous Peoples, this means using the truth to rebuild our lives, our families, our communities and Canada itself. And for governments, this means nothing less than a new and decolonized social order; it is an opportunity to transform and to rebuild in real partnership with Indigenous Peoples.\u201d\nAnd, in its 231 recommendations, or \u201ccalls for justice\u201d the inquiry provides governments across the country and the Canadian people with an ambitious agenda to achieve that new social order.\nAs Commissioner Audette concluded: \u201cWe cannot change the past, but we can work together to shape a better future built on the strengths of each and every community \u2026 thereby committing to improving the safety of Indigenous women and girls, together.\u201d\nJim Vibert, a journalist and writer for longer than he cares to admit, consulted or worked for five Nova Scotia governments. He now keeps a close and critical eye on provincial and regional powers.\nRELATED:\u00a0\n\nCalls for justice \u2018incumbent on every Canadian\u2019 following missing and murdered Indigenous women

        "body": "\n\nSectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsOpinionCommentaryInquiry into missing indigenous women must look beyond policing: StewardThere is a cycle of racism and abuse that extends beyond policing and aboriginal women, who are the focus of the inquiryJudge Marion Buller speaks after being announced as the chief commissioner of the inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women at the Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec earlier this month.\u00a0\u00a0(Justin Tang / THE CANADIAN PRESS)\u00a0\u00a0By Gillian StewardAtkinson FellowTues., Aug. 23, 2016The announcement of the panel members for the national Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls underlined how rare it is to see a judge who is both a woman and aboriginal.In this instance the rarity is Judge Marion Buller of the B.C. provincial court who will head the inquiry slated to begin work in September.Buller, who hails from the Mistawasis Cree First Nation in central Saskatchewan, was named B.C.\u2019s first aboriginal female judge in 1994 and has since initiated key changes to the province\u2019s justice system. She was instrumental in the establishment of a First Nations Court in B.C. in 2006.There are now four First Nations courts. They differ from standard courts in that they are solely sentencing courts and include First Nations elders who work with a judge to determine healing plans to rehabilitate the offender and repair the harm done to the community by the crime.Before she was appointed to the bench, Buller served as commission counsel for the 1993 Cariboo-Chilcotin Justice Inquiry, which looked into pervasive reports of racism and abuse of power by the RCMP in northern B.C. First Nations communities.Article Continued BelowThat experience will serve her well as she and the other panel members navigate the tense relationship the families of the hundreds of murdered and missing indigenous women have with police services across the country; police services that they say did little or nothing to solve the murders and disappearances of their mothers, daughters, sisters, and aunts.The task before the panel is daunting.First of all, when relatives and friends start to tell their stories about how their loved ones were ignored or abused by the police, how does the panel upend the pervasive stereotyping that is part and parcel of life as an aboriginal woman in Canada?It\u2019s still common for people, including some judges, to blame the female victims of violence and sexual assault as though they were the cause of their own demise. Add to this the racist, demeaning attitudes toward aboriginal people in general and it\u2019s no surprise it took decades for aboriginal women activists to be taken seriously when they demanded an inquiry.Some activists are disappointed that the inquiry does not have a mandate to reopen cold cases or investigate particular policing decisions.But while policing authorities have a lot to answer for, is it fair to put the entire blame for these tragedies on their shoulders?What about the rest of the justice system?What about the lack of aboriginal judges at all levels of the courts?Kathleen Mahoney, a professor at the University of Calgary\u2019s law faculty has pointed out that during the five years preceding 2015, the federal appointment rate for aboriginal judges is 1.04 per cent even though aboriginals make up 4.3 per cent of the Canadian population.Of course, in some provinces the ratio is much higher. According to StatsCan aboriginals account for about 10 per cent of the population In Saskatchewan and Manitoba; 30 per cent in the Northwest TerritoriesWhen you consider that 75 per cent of the prison population in Saskatchewan is aboriginal, the need for more aboriginal judges becomes even more pressing.But according to Mahoney, white males have long held a distinct advantage when it comes to judicial appointments.\u201cThe most recent data on judicial appointments indicates the typical lawyer appointed to the bench is a white 53-year-old male, and a civil litigator practicing in a firm of more than 60 lawyers, who would not, as a rule, practice family law, human rights, immigration law or aboriginal rights, which are of course areas of particular concern to women and minorities,\u201d Mahoney wrote in an article for a law journal.Are the police and the aboriginal women who are the focus of this inquiry simply caught in a cycle of racism and abuse that is condoned and perpetuated by people in much higher positions of authority but who will likely never be called to account?Let\u2019s hope Buller leaves no stone unturned.Gillian Steward is a Calgary writer and former managing editor of the Calgary Herald.

But her family is still left wondering how she died and whether she will ever get justice.Tears roll down the cheeks of Thelma Favel, Tina Fontaine's great-aunt and the woman who raised her, during a march Friday, Feb. 23, 2018, in Winnipeg the day after the jury delivered a not-guilty verdict in the second degree murder trial of Raymond Cormier.\u00a0\u00a0(JOHN WOODS / THE CANADIAN PRESS file photo)By The Canadian PressWed., March 7, 2018SAGKEENG FIRST NATION, Man.\u2014Thelma Favel woke up every morning before going to the Winnipeg courthouse, looked around her room and wondered what her grandniece might have thought when she stayed in the same hotel in her final weeks alive.During the second-degree murder trial for Raymond Cormier \u2014 the man acquitted last month of killing Tina Fontaine \u2014 Favel wanted to put herself in the teenage girl\u2019s shoes.Favel stayed in the same downtown hotel where the young girl was placed by Child and Family Services and walked the same streets where Tina was last seen alive.Read more:Indigenous youth say justice-system reforms are necessary to achieve reconciliationArticle Continued BelowToronto protesters demand justice for Tina Fontaine and other Indigenous girlsAcquittal of Raymond Cormier in Tina Fontaine\u2019s death disappoints Winnipeg police chief\u201cI just found strength every day to get up and go. I walked the hallways, wondering which room she was in,\u201d Favel told The Canadian Press. \u201cI just felt so close to her there.\u201dSecurity camera footage was shown in court of Tina falling asleep between two cars behind a building named after Helen Betty Osborne \u2014 a Cree woman kidnapped and killed in Manitoba in 1971. Favel went there, too.\u201cI just don\u2019t know what happened to her that month-and-a-half (in Winnipeg). I just don\u2019t know what happened at all.\u201dTina spent much of her young life living with Favel on the Sagkeeng First Nation, north of Winnipeg. She was a kind girl who liked to study math and science, Favel said. She had a lot of friends and never got into trouble.But after her father was murdered in 2011, Tina had difficulty coping. She left the First Nation in June 2014 to reconnect with her mother in Winnipeg. When Favel didn\u2019t hear from the girl, she called Child and Family Services for help.In the following weeks, 15-year-old Tina disappeared multiple times, returned to government care and was placed in a hotel.Her 72-pound body, wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down by rocks, was pulled from the Red River that August.Her death renewed calls for a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and inspired volunteer groups such as the Bear Clan Patrol to protect the vulnerable on the streets.Favel said she had faith in the justice system as she sat in court nearly every day throughout the more than three-week trial. She listened to testimony from experts and from people who knew Tina in Winnipeg. She heard audio of Cormier himself, recorded by police during a six-month undercover operation.In February, the chief of Tina Fontaine\u2019s home community said Sagkeeng First Nation will be \u201churting\u201d after Raymond Cormier was found not guilty in the teen\u2019s death in 2014. (The Canadian Press) When Tina\u2019s voice from a 911 call was played in court, Favel said she \u201cjust wanted to hear her over and over and over again.\u201d\u201cTina was with me. She was there with me every single day and I had my rosaries around my hand every day. That\u2019s where I got my strength. I had to do it for Tina,\u201d said Favel, breaking into tears.\u201cHer voice was stolen. She was silenced forever so I had to be there to be her pillar of hope, to get justice for her. Even that I failed at.\u201dAfter a jury acquitted Cormier, rallies were held across the country for Tina. But Favel and her family are left wondering how Tina died and whether she will ever get justice.Favel is exhausted and her husband has suffered two strokes \u2014 one right after Tina\u2019s body was found and another when the trial started.\u201cI thought he was the strong one, but big men do crumble because she captured his heart,\u201d Favel said. \u201cTina was his heart.\u201dTina was tiny but powerful, Favel said. The teen\u2019s family has found strength in the way her life and death have become a rallying cry for change.Favel is not optimistic the acquittal will be appealed and said she would like to see other charges laid against Cormier. If there is an inquest or inquiry into Tina\u2019s death, Favel said she will still be there every step of the way.Talking about Tina still hurts \u2014 it\u2019s a reminder of a young, promising life taken too soon. But Favel said she knows it\u2019s important because \u201cGod had other plans for Tina.\u201d\u201cShe was silenced but still her cries are being heard everywhere. This is not over yet. She is going to do something about all of this wrong that is going on.\u201dDelivered dailyThe Morning Headlines\u00a0NewsletterSubscribeThe Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E\u00a01E6.

Assembly of First Nations of Quebec and Labrador (AFNQL) is calling on Quebecers to help bring about change by fighting against racism, based on recent L\u00e9ger poll results.The issue of discrimination against native communities has been in the news in the past year, including random Montreal SPVM police checks of native women.The Assembly of First Nations Quebec-Labrador (AFNQL) announced that \"it is developing its own action plan to address discrimination and racism. The results of a L\u00e9ger survey motivate the AFNQL to create a space for dialogue with the Quebec population and to invite allies to implement concrete solutions.\"\nThe survey was conducted between July 17 and 23 and, according to the AFNQL, \"confirms the progress made in recent years in terms of Quebecers' opinion of First Nations. Almost all Quebecers recognize the reality of racism or discrimination experienced by First Nations and a very large majority of them support the positions of First Nations in this regard.\"Given the strength of these results, the AFNQL wishes to give an important place to allies in its plan to fight racism and discrimination currently under development. This action plan will be made public by the end of September 2020.\"We see that the days when First Nations were considered as privileged are clearly over,\" stated Ghislain Picard, Chief of the AFNQL. \"The opinion of Quebecers has greatly evolved, and the survey confirms that they are much more sensitive to the racism experienced by First Nations than their political representatives. Quebecers are also more open to dialogue and the search for real solutions.\"Chief Picard added that another reason for the AFNQL action plans is that it is \"little inspired by the action group against racism created by the Legault government. Composed solely of members of the party in power, this committee has little credibility in the eyes of First Nations leaders.\"The AFNQL leader also noted that Legault \"has publicly stated that he does not believe in 'systemic racism.'\"Systemic racism, structural discrimination, whatever you want to call it, this is a reality, and we must face it with the necessary means,\" Chief Picard stated. \"This is what we are going to tackle right now by inviting the people of Quebec to lead a real fight against racism experienced by our populations.\"The AFNQL also said that the issue of racism \"has been the subject of many consultations over the past few years and that several avenues for solutions have been presented, notably in the context of the Public Inquiry Commission on relations between Indigenous Peoples and certain public services in Qu\u00e9bec (Viens Commission), whose report was made public on September 30, 2019.\n\"The AFNQL believes that it will be impossible for Premier Legault's government to turn a blind eye to our initiative,\" Chief Picard stated. \"It must commit to correcting the situations of systemic and structural racism and discrimination, which it is often the source of, and which remain major obstacles to the social justice to which everyone is entitled.\"The L\u00e9ger survey found:\u2022 \"Among non-Indigenous Quebecers who have an opinion of First Nations in Quebec, this opinion is good in eight out of 10 cases (81%).\u2022 \"Most Quebecers admit that they have little or no knowledge of the issues and realities of First Nations in Quebec (58%).\"\u2022 Most Quebecers \"consider that the relations that non-Indigenous Quebecers have with First Nations in Quebec are poor (53%).\"\u2022 \"Almost all non-Indigenous Quebecers (92%) think that First Nations are subject to racism or discrimination in Quebec.\"\u2022 Eighty percent of respondents \"consider that First Nations people face additional obstacles in the different facets of their lives.\"\u2022 Seventy percent of those who have an opinion \"are of the opinion that, currently in Quebec, First Nations are not treated on the same footing as non-Indigenous Quebecers in social structures.\u2022 Ninety-one percent of respondents \"believe that the Quebec government has an important role to play in achieving and maintaining equality between First Nations and non-Indigenous Quebecers.\"\n\n\n\njoel@thesuburban.com\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoel Goldenberg\n\n Follow Joel Goldenberg\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nPost a comment as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmoticons \n\n\n[smile]\n[beam]\n[wink]\n[sad]\n[cool]\n[innocent]\n[rolleyes]\n[whistling]\n[lol]\n[huh]\n[tongue]\n[love]\n[sleeping]\n[yawn]\n[unsure]\n[angry]\n[blink]\n[crying]\n[ohmy]\n[scared]\n[sleep]\n[sneaky]\n[tongue_smile]\n[thumbdown]\n[thumbup]\n[censored]\n[happybirthday]\n[ban]\n[spam]\n[offtopic]\n[batman]\n[ninja]\n[pirate]\n[alien]\n\n\n\nComment Text\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\nPost comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nReport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\nReport Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nWatch this discussion.\nStop watching this discussion.\n\n\n\n\nWatch this discussion\n\n\n\n\n                            Get an email notification whenever someone contributes to the discussion\n                        \n\n                            Notifications from this discussion will be disabled.\n                        \n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\n\nStart watching\nStop watching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (0) comments \n                            \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the discussion.\n\n\nLog In\n\n\n\nKeep it Clean.

I walked the hallways, wondering which room she was in,\" Favel told The Canadian Press. \"I just felt so close to her there.\"Security camera footage was shown in court of Tina falling asleep between two cars behind a building named after Helen Betty Osborne \u2014 a Cree woman kidnapped and killed in Manitoba in 1971. Favel went there, too.\"I just don't know what happened to her that month-and-a-half (in Winnipeg). I just don't know what happened at all.\"Tina spent much of her young life living with Favel on the Sagkeeng First Nation, north of Winnipeg. She was a kind girl who liked to study math and science, Favel said. She had a lot of friends and never got into trouble.But after her father was murdered in 2011, Tina had difficulty coping. She left the First Nation in June 2014 to reconnect with her mother in Winnipeg. When Favel didn't hear from the girl, she called Child and Family Services for help.In the following weeks, 15-year-old Tina disappeared multiple times, returned to government care and was placed in a hotel.Her 72-pound body, wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down by rocks, was pulled from the Red River that August.Her death renewed calls for a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and inspired volunteer groups such as the Bear Clan Patrol to protect the vulnerable on the streets.Favel said she had faith in the justice system as she sat in court nearly every day throughout the more than three-week trial. She listened to testimony from experts and from people who knew Tina in Winnipeg. She heard audio of Cormier himself, recorded by police during a six-month undercover operation.When Tina's voice from a 911 call was played in court, Favel said she \"just wanted to hear her over and over and over again.\"\"Tina was with me. She was there with me every single day and I had my rosaries around my hand every day. That's where I got my strength. I had to do it for Tina,\" said Favel, breaking into tears.\"Her voice was stolen. She was silenced forever so I had to be there to be her pillar of hope, to get justice for her. Even that I failed at.\"After a jury acquitted Cormier, rallies were held across the country for Tina. But Favel and her family are left wondering how Tina died and whether she will ever get justice.Favel is exhausted and her husband has suffered two strokes \u2014 one right after Tina's body was found and another when the trial started.\"I thought he was the strong one, but big men do crumble because she captured his heart,\" Favel said. \"Tina was his heart.\"Tina was tiny but powerful, Favel said. The teen's family has found strength in the way her life and death have become a rallying cry for change.Favel is not optimistic the acquittal will be appealed and said she would like to see other charges laid against Cormier. If there is an inquest or inquiry into Tina's death, Favel said she will still be there every step of the way.Talking about Tina still hurts \u2014 it's a reminder of a young, promising life taken too soon. But Favel said she knows it's important because \"God had other plans for Tina.\"\"She was silenced but still her cries are being heard everywhere. This is not over yet. She is going to do something about all of this wrong that is going on.\"\u2014 By Kelly Geraldine Malone in Winnipeg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nNational\n \nSocial\n \nJustice\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nPost a comment as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmoticons \n\n\n[smile]\n[beam]\n[wink]\n[sad]\n[cool]\n[innocent]\n[rolleyes]\n[whistling]\n[lol]\n[huh]\n[tongue]\n[love]\n[sleeping]\n[yawn]\n[unsure]\n[angry]\n[blink]\n[crying]\n[ohmy]\n[scared]\n[sleep]\n[sneaky]\n[tongue_smile]\n[thumbdown]\n[thumbup]\n[censored]\n[happybirthday]\n[ban]\n[spam]\n[offtopic]\n[batman]\n[ninja]\n[pirate]\n[alien]\n\n\n\nComment Text\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\nPost comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nReport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\nReport Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nWatch this discussion.\nStop watching this discussion.\n\n\n\n\nWatch this discussion\n\n\n\n\n                            Get an email notification whenever someone contributes to the discussion\n                        \n\n                            Notifications from this discussion will be disabled.\n                        \n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\n\nStart watching\nStop watching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (0) comments \n                            \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the discussion.\n\n\nLog In\n\n\n\nKeep it Clean.

Despite this tragic failure to do its job, the agency is not being held accountable,\" Hunt says.\n\n\n\"How is it possible that despite WorkSafeBC's claim of conducting the most thorough and exhaustive investigations in their history, more evidence is still coming to light, while other documents are withheld and receive no scrutiny from the Coroner's Jury or the public?\" Hunt asks.\n\n\nThe USW continues to join family members, First Nations and the larger community in calling for a public inquiry.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSOURCE  United Steelworkers (USW)\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\tFor further information: Stephen Hunt, USW District 3 Director, 604-816-2554; Brad West, USW Communications, 604-313-9185, bwest@usw.ca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganization Profile\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n              United Steelworkers (USW)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2015 CNW Group Ltd.\n\n\nFran\u00e7ais\n\nPrivacy & Terms of Use\nCareers\nMedia Partners\nRSS Feeds\nTwitter\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

But what should they be?Solutions have been offered in dozens of reports, including from the Ontario Human Rights Commission, judicial reviews, the Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls Inquiry and numerous inquests including into the fatal police shooting of Andrew Loku, a 45-year-old Black man, in 2015. Some recommendations, like better training, are predictable and long-standing. Others, like the push by activists for defunding the police, are gathering steam in an unprecedented way. Here are eight police reforms being called for in Canada and how effective they could be in reducing bias and increasing accountability:Defunding the policeOver the past few decades, police have been given more and more responsibility while social services including mental health supports have seen funding cuts, said Akwasi Owusu-Bempah, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Toronto who researches race and policing. \u201cWe increasingly have police dealing with issues of poverty and homelessness,\u201d he said. \u201cPolice have also become first responders to mental health issues.\u201dProponents of defunding police services \u2014 by cutting their budgets and reducing their responsibilities \u2014 say more frequent interactions with officers increase the criminalization of Black, Indigenous and vulnerable people and the likelihood of a violent encounter, particularly in cases of a mental health crisis. \u201cWhen we ask the police to address issues they are inequipped to address, then we are funding them to fail,\u201d Owusu-Bempah said, paraphrasing one of his students. Police have also increasingly become involved in youth programming and crime prevention initiatives that could be better done by non-police organizations, he said. Until recently, calls to defund police have had limited mainstream appeal. Police budgets remain the most expensive line items in many cities\u2019 budgets, including in Toronto, where the budget is more than $1 billion.Advocates say these budgets should be cut and the money invested instead in mental health responses and in addressing the root causes of crime. For Sandy Hudson, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Toronto, it means ultimately replacing the police with something different rather than continuing to try and reform a fundamentally broken institution. More independent civilian oversightIn Ontario, there are two main external oversight bodies for police: The Special Investigations Unit, which investigates incidents involving police where there is a death, serious injury or allegations of sexual assault, and the Office of the Independent Police Review Director which handles public complaints against police.In 2017 the Tulloch report into independent police oversight recommended the OIPRD investigate all public conduct complaints itself rather than the more common practice of referring them back to the professional standards unit of the police force where the complaint originated. \u201cIndependent investigation would help foster public trust in not only the complaints system, but policing more generally,\u201d the report stated.This recommendation is not among the changes made to the OIPRD under Premier Doug Ford\u2019s Community Safety and Policing Act, which was passed last year but is not yet in effect. The new Law Enforcement Complaints Agency will handle complaints pertaining to chiefs or deputy chiefs and complaints \u201cdetermined to be in the public interest\u201d internally but continue to send other complaints to the originating police service or another police service. The value of civilian oversight comes from being independent from police, said Kate Puddister, an assistant professor at the University of Guelph who researches police oversight. \u201cIf the body tasked with investigating complaints against the police simply sends them back to the very same police service, the goals of civilian oversight are compromised,\u201d she said.Meanwhile, the SIU suffers from a significant public trust problem, the Tulloch review found. Since the report, some changes have been made, including that reports are now released where no charges are laid and that the SIU must be notified when an officer fires a gun at a person. But the Ford government\u2019s new legislation also narrows the watchdog\u2019s mandate. Police will no longer be required to notify the SIU in the cases of deaths such as a suicide or from a heart attack, unless the police chief \u201creasonably believes\u201d that an officer\u2019s conduct may have been a contributing factor in the incident. This is a controversial change that some have warned could lead to confusion about when the SIU should be notified.For the watchdog to function, it must both have the tools to hold police accountable and \u201cbe seen by the community as fulfilling this responsibility,\u201d Puddister said. \u201cThe public needs to understand the nature of the investigations by SIU and the evidence from which SIU makes its decision either or not to substantiate charges against police officers.\u201d Puddister noted that the SIU has issued more frequent updates than normal on the high-profile investigation into the death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet, who fell from the balcony of a High Park apartment building in the presence of Toronto police officers. She hopes the same can be done for other cases. More trainingThis is a frequent, almost inevitable, recommendation in reports and inquests. Millions in funding for unconscious-bias training for police was part of the federal Liberal election platform (a spokesperson for the Minister of Public Safety did not say how much money had been allocated to this so far).In Ontario, the Ontario Human Rights Commission has released a detailed report on what training to combat racial profiling should include. Many police forces, including the Toronto police service, already have mandatory annual bias and diversity training. The Ontario Police College also includes training on bias, which the Ontario Human Rights Commission has said should include the impacts of under-policing on Indigenous communities.But, Hudson said, more training is not the answer. \u201cI don\u2019t know what additional training we haven\u2019t thought of yet that could possibly be implemented that is going to change things now in 2020,\u201d she said.

Diversity in a police force is important for two reasons, said Owusu-Bempah. A diverse workforce would ensure the only interactions a police officer has with a Black or Indigenous person are not through policing. It also means more people will see themselves reflected in the institutions. But diversity means little if police cultures and police mandates don\u2019t change, he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect a Black officer, in an organization that is slow to change, to address broad societal issues.\u201d More transparencyAdvocates have long called for better access to officers\u2019 disciplinary records as a measure for public accountability. The OIPRD posts tribunal decisions on public complaints in a searchable database on its website, but this does not include complaints resolved in other ways and does not include internal records of misconduct that do not go before the police tribunal. Full disciplinary records are rarely released publicly other than through civil cases or inquests \u2014 unlike in some U.S. cities like Minneapolis where a summary of an officer\u2019s disciplinary history is publicly available. Similarly, some U.S. police forces release the names of officers involved in fatal shootings. In Ontario, officers who are investigated but not charged by the Special Investigations Unit are not named. Their identities are also often only revealed through inquests and civil cases. Criminal defence lawyers have also called for better access to disciplinary records and a more transparent process to identify police officers who have been found to have lied in court. RELATED STORIESCanadaIn the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s death, calls grow to \u2018defund the police.\u2019 But what would that actually mean?5 days ago GTAFrom police shootings to protests over anti-Black racism: Toronto\u2019s last three decades of racial controversy5 days ago City HallIn the face of a massive COVID-19 financial shortfall and anti-racism protests, is it time to defund Toronto police?3 days ago More dataThe Toronto Police now has a policy mandating the collection of race-based data, which currently is limited only to use-of-force incidents but will expand in the future to include stops and arrests. The data collection was part of a push by several advocates and the Ontario Human Rights Commission following inquiries into racial profiling and findings of disproportionate use-of-force against Black people in Toronto. The data is to be used to ensure racial disparities are documented and addressed. It could also allow patterns involving specific officers to be detected. Similar policies may be adopted at other police forces, said Owusu-Bempah, who was involved in developing the Toronto policy. But, he said, there needs to be caution in monitoring the quality of the data, including how it is being collected. The data also needs to be publicly accessible and updated on a frequent basis, he said.More technologyThere are growing calls for police forces in Ontario to use body cameras, and Toronto police Mark Saunders has announced he will be fast-tracking their deployment. But there is mixed evidence when it comes to how useful they are for police accountability and reducing use of force. Hudson and others have said the significant investment that would be required may not be worth the cost when that money could be spent in community programs. Police investment in additional and controversial surveillance measures, such as Stingrays and facial recognition technology, have had broad privacy implications and should also be reconsidered, Hudson added. Fewer weapons: As with defunding the police, the push to reduce police reliance on both lethal and non-lethal weapons is growing. Advocates for disarming police, including limiting the use of guns, Tasers and other weapons, often point to the U.K. and other jurisdictions where police officers are not typically armed with a gun. Hudson said there should be an examination of police budgets to see how much money is being spent on weapons and what is being bought. \u201cWhy are allowing the police to arm themselves when that does not increase our safety,\u201d she said.

The presence of so many women from the Peace Region at previous rallies initially set off the investigation by Amnesty International.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\tWhen Amnesty International's Craig Benjamin began researching missing and murdered women in Fort St. John earlier this year, he knew it was a big problem.\n\n\tHe didn't know how big.\n\n\t\"When we started really meeting people from a wide range range of organizations, First Nations community members and government, it became clear there was really an enormous story to be told,\" said Benjamin, an Ottawa-based campaigner with the human rights group.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\tSo enormous that Amnesty is expanding its mission in the Peace Region. Benjamin returned to the Peace last week as part of that mission. The goal is to better understand how natural resource development impacts the safety of women and children. First Nations groups, non-profits and the local RCMP will be among the interviewees.\n\n\tAmnesty initially planned to wrap up its investigation in May.\n\n\tOn Oct. 4, First Nations activists from the Peace travelled to a missing and murdered women vigil on Parliament Hill. The presence of so many women from the Peace Region at previous rallies initially set off the investigation, Benjamin said.\u00a0\n\n\t\"I think there's a public consensus that indigenous women face a greatly elevated threat of violence in their lives,\" he said.\n\n\t\"We thought it would be useful to focus on a particular community and look in greater depth at the issues and reflect back to the public what people on the front lines are saying needs to happen.\"\n\n\tA 2014 RCMP report found that 1,181 aboriginal women had gone missing (164) or been killed (1,017) since 1980. As of April 2015, there were 174 open missing persons cases involving aboriginal women across the country.\n\n\tRegional numbers are difficult to come by, though most believe more than a dozen women from the Peace have gone missing or been killed in that timeframe.\n\n\tWhile the issue is usually associated with Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, Benjamin said there is much to learn about violence against indigenous women in resource communities.\u00a0\n\n\t\"If you look at the Oppal Commission, it was focused on the Downtown Eastside,\" he said, referring to the Missing Women Commission, which delivered its report in 2012.\n\n\t\"It had some content examining the Highway of Tears. But it didn't extend its reach farther north than that.\n\n\t\"One reason for (studying Fort St. John) was to raise awareness of how easy it is to neglect the experience of people in the more northern regions.\"\n\n\tWhile it's too soon to say what recommendations the Amnesty report will make to government and social services, housing has come up in every discussion.\n\n\t\"People who don't have access to the great wages of the oil patch find it very difficult to find affordable accommodation,\" he said.\n\n\t\"When we look at the risk factors for violence against women, lack of access to safe and affordable housing is a key one. It pushes women into risky situations, or deters women from leaving abusive situations.\"\n\n\tAmnesty expects to release its full report in the next six months.\n\nreporter@dcdn.ca\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2015 Alaska Highway News\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Comments\n                \n\n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\tNOTE: To post a comment you must have an account with at least one of the following services:\n\t                    Disqus, Facebook, Twitter, Google+\n\t                    You may then login using your account credentials for that service.\n\t                    If you do not already have an account you may register a new profile with Disqus\n\t                    by first clicking the \"Post as\" button and then the link: \"Don't have one?

It\u2019s time they hit the road to hear from victims\u2019 families if they are to deliver an interim report by November.Marion Buller, Chief Commissioner of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, says the commission does not yet know when public hearings will get underway.\u00a0\u00a0(FRED CHARTRAND / THE CANADIAN PRESS)\u00a0\u00a0By Star Editorial BoardWed., Feb. 8, 2017There\u2019s no question the five members of the $53.8-million national inquiry into murdered and missing indigenous women have a daunting task before them.They must identify the systemic issues that contribute to violence against aboriginal girls and women \u2013 from policing, welfare and child care practices to sexual abuse on reserves, government policies and social conditions. It will be a lot of work. Indeed, before the inquiry got underway, the three ministers responsible for establishing it \u2014 Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, and then-Status of Women Minister Patty Hajdu \u2014 heard from 2,100 participants and received 4,100 online submissions in just over just two months. So there\u2019s no telling how many victims\u2019 families will want to tell their stories before the commission, or how many people, such as police, the commissioners will want to interview.Still, that is no reason for them not to get on with it. The inquiry was announced in December, 2015. And the commission members have had since last Sept. 1 to get their act together. Article Continued BelowYet not one public hearing has been held. In fact, the commission was incommunicado until this week when it held its very first press conference to announce that it still couldn\u2019t say when public hearings will actually get underway. Vague answer? Sometime this spring. Really? That isn\u2019t good enough. The commission of inquiry must hit the road quickly to hear from victims and families and communities if they are to meet their timetable of delivering an interim report by November of this year and a final report by Dec. 31, 2018.While that is relatively speedy in the history of commissions of inquiry \u2014 the Truth and Reconciliation Commission ran two years over its official five-year mandate \u2014 it is a timeline they must keep. Not to do so would be to dash, once again, the hopes of so many families and communities across the country who are looking for answers to painful but vital questions. Among them: why 16 per cent of all women murdered in Canada are indigenous, although only 4 per cent of Canadian women are. Or why, by the RCMP\u2019s own 2014 tally, 1,181 indigenous women and girls had been murdered or gone missing between 1980 and 2012, a number that has since grown. Time is of the essence. As shocking as those numbers are, they may be just the tip of the iceberg. A year ago, after their cross-country consultations to establish the inquiry, Bennett suggested the number of murdered and missing indigenous women was \u201cway bigger than 1,200,\u201d while Hajdu suggested it might be as high as 4,000.That discrepancy arises partly because police officers often do not consider victims to have been murdered even though their families do. That\u2019s a police practice the inquiry is also expected to investigate.The chief commissioner of the inquiry, B.C. Judge Marion Buller, says she is aware \u201cof the impatience and frustration\u201d surrounding how long it has taken to get the hearings underway. But she excused the delay by saying: \u201cWe have to do the hearings and our work in a thoughtful and purposeful way.\u201d That would hold more water if she hadn\u2019t said the same thing last October.Enough, already. The commissioners have a mandate to deliver answers to grieving families and communities \u2014 indeed, all of Canada \u2014 by the end of 2018. They cannot lose any more time getting started with this important work.Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines\u00a0NewsletterSubscribeThe Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E\u00a01E6.

These were youths who had their whole lives ahead of them. The fact that deep-seated institutional and societal racism and violence against Indigenous peoples is what led to their deaths is a glaring injustice that we have seen happen many times over to our people. But the other glaring injustice is how institutional and societal racism and violence allows the killers of our people to walk free. The high level of impunity for lethal race-based violence against Indigenous peoples serves only to reinforce the racist idea that Indigenous lives don't matter. Without intervention from federal, provincial and municipal governments, agencies and police forces, our people will continue to be at risk.\nCanada's failure to act on this crisis means that First Nations must continue to take action to stand against these injustices which are killing our people. At a time when our hearts were collectively breaking over the non-guilty verdicts in the Gerald Stanley murder trial of Colten Boushie and the Raymond Cormier murder trial of Tina Fontaine, First Nation members from Saskatchewan got together and created the Justice for Our Stolen Children Camp. On February 28, 2018, they raised a traditional teepee and lit a sacred fire in Treaty 4 territory at Wascana Park, just across from the Saskatchewan legislative building. These grassroots community members used their most powerful tool to bring attention to this crisis -- their voices and their traditions.\nBut the teepee and the sacred fire not only attracted media attention for our issues, it also turned into something special. This camp became a gathering place for those who had lost children to violence, foster care and the justice system. Mothers, fathers, aunties and cousins with broken hearts came to the camp to share their stories, release their emotions and start their healing journeys. Far from creating any safety risk to the public, this camp offered hope, comfort, solidarity, a sense of collectiveness and empowerment. The longer the camp remained at Wascana Park, the more the media took notice and started to highlight the many injustices faced by First Nations. The core message from the camp was that we need justice specifically for Indigenous youth in the wake of the Stanley and Cormier not guilty verdicts; and justice for the many Indigenous children stolen from our communities by child welfare agencies, the justice system and societal violence.\nFor many months, it may have appeared to outsiders looking in, that they were alone and that their camp would eventually fade from attention. They occupied the area peacefully for four months, supported by donations from First Nations and allies. It wasn't until the Province of Saskatchewan thought the camp would interfere with its planned location for its Canada Day beer gardens that they took legal action. On June 5, the camp was issued and eviction order and 10 days later, the Regina Police Service began their eviction procedures by removing the tents. On June 17 the teepee was taken down and on June 18 six of the campers were arrested and removed from the area, though charges were never laid. Many of us watched with anger as the province carried out this heavy-handed action, trampling over the wounded hearts of those who have found some temporary peace at the camp -- all for the sake of beer gardens.\nBut if there is one lesson from our elders that we have to remember, is that we can never give up hope. Our ancestors died protecting the rights of future generations not yet born. We inherited the obligation to face each barrier put in front of us by colonial powers, with the same commitment to overcoming it, as our ancestors had. So, on June 21 National Indigenous Peoples Day, when we saw videos of the campers returning to Wascana Park, re-erecting the teepee and joining together in a round dance, our collective hearts were lifted again -- this time with a renewed sense of resistance and empowerment. On June 23, a second teepee was erected and others joined in solidarity after that until there were many teepees side by side. People made donations of cash, food and water to support the campers and the healing continued. We owe so much to the spirit and determination of those who have stayed at the camp for long. Their commitment is why we are still talking about justice for our stolen children.\nThere is a real and growing crisis in Saskatchewan that demands an emergency, crisis-level joint response by federal, provincial and First Nation governments, experts and advocates. It doesn't matter what the federal or provincial governments say they have done, what programs they have funded, or who they talk to at various discussion tables -- what matters is that what they have done to date has not worked and the crisis continues to get worse. Therefore, a radical shift from the status quo is required to save the lives of our children. They don't have a whole childhood to wait for the slow, drawn-out process of policy change. Our children are dying and the statistics present a dire picture for their life chances if we don't change this now.\nChild welfare\nIn Canada, Indigenous peoples make up five per cent of the population and Indigenous youth make up seven per cent of the youth population. Nationally, Indigenous children make up 48 per cent of all children in foster care -- a number that is three times higher than during the height of residential schools. However, in Saskatchewan, an alarming more than 70 per cent of children in provincial care are Indigenous and the numbers continue to increase. We know that less than half of those children will graduate from high school and more likely to end up in youth corrections. The statistics also show that that Indigenous girls in foster care are four times more likely to be sexually abused; more likely to be targeted for human sex trafficking and are over-represented in murdered and missing Indigenous girls. The theft of our children into foster care does not just impact the children. Indigenous mothers who lose their children to foster care are more likely to die from heart disease and suicide.\nJustice system -- prison\nCanada has had the lowest crime rate since 1969 with a reduction of 34 per cent since 1998. Yet Indigenous people make up more than 26 per cent of those in federal prisons and Indigenous women make up 34 per cent. Saskatchewan's numbers are frightening. Over 76 per cent of admissions to Saskatchewan prisons are Indigenous -- the highest rates in Canada. Nationally, 41 per cent of youth in corrections are Indigenous, with 51 per cent being Indigenous girls. In Saskatchewan youth corrections, 92 per cent are Indigenous boys and 98 per cent are Indigenous girls. They have the highest youth incarceration rates in the entire country. More than one-fifth of Indigenous prisoners were in residential schools and two-thirds were in the child welfare system. It is important to remember that Indigenous peoples represent one-third of all suicides in prison and more than half of those who suffer in solitary confinement/segregation.\nViolence -- state and societal\nIn 1996, the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples noted that racism is rampant from police forces to the courts. Saskatchewan policing in particular has a long, violent history of racism against Indigenous peoples. In 2004, the Saskatchewan Commission on First Nations and Metis Peoples and Justice Reform found that racism in policing was a \"major obstacle\" in relations with First Nations. The well-known police practice of \"Starlight Tours\" where police detain and drive Indigenous men to the outskirts of town where they freeze to death doesn't seem to have ended with the Neil Stonechild inquiry. Indigenous women are often targeted with sexualized violence -- including from police. The Human Rights Watch report from 2017 documented instances of excessive use of force, abusive strip searches and other sexual harassment against Indigenous women. The statistics also show that Saskatchewan has the highest rate of police involved deaths (beatings, chokings, shootings) of Indigenous peoples (62.5 per cent).\nThe RCMP report into murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls showed that nationally Indigenous women and girls make up 16 per cent of those murdered, but in Saskatchewan, that number jumps to 55 per cent. Societal violence comes from the places most people do not suspect: priests, farmers, police, corrections, doctors, lawyers, judges, social workers, teachers, and foster parents. Very few of those who sexually violate or murder Indigenous women and girls are serial killers. The statistics also show they are less likely to be murdered by their spouse than Canadian women. The high level of impunity (non-conviction) for those perpetrators in society who continue to commit violence against Indigenous peoples is exacerbated by the many reports that document how police fail to protect Indigenous peoples or properly investigate their cases.\nWe have a real crisis in Saskatchewan. What has been done isn't working. We need a new approach -- one that is led by First Nations and their experts and advocates. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to the campers at the Justice for Our Stolen Children Camp who have sacrificed their time and energy, and risked police arrest and jail, to keep the light on this crisis. We don't want to lose any more of our children and we want to bring the rest of our children who are in foster care, corrections, trapped by human traffickers, or missing -- back home. Bring our children home.\nIn memory of all those precious lives those and sadly, too many to name:\nNeil Stonechild, Leo Lachance, William Kakakaway, Leonard Paul John, Colten Boushie\nNadine Machiskinic, Shelley Napope, Melanie Dawn Geddes, Amber Redman, Danita Bigeagle\nHaven Dubois, Brandon-Bee Ironchild, Evander Lee Daniels\nPlease see my YouTube video that I have created in support of the Justice for Our Stolen Children Camp.\nThis article was originally published on Pamela Palmater's blog on August 23, 2018.\nPhoto: Memaxmarz/Flickr\nLike this article? rabble is reader-supported journalism. \n\n\n\n \n\nIndigenous Childrenindigenous youthindigenous resistance\n\nThank you for reading this story...\nMore people are reading rabble.ca than ever and unlike many news organizations, we have never put up a paywall \u2013 at rabble we\u2019ve always believed in making our reporting and analysis free to all.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan HaywardWHITEHORSE  \u2013  The distraught son of Wendy Carlick, an advocate for missing and murdered indigenous women who was found dead weeks ago, interrupted the national inquiry on Wednesday to share his grief.\nAlex Carlick walked into the tent in Whitehorse where another family was testifying and began to speak into a microphone. Wearing dark sunglasses, he said he was crying because both his mom and sister were taken from him.\n\u201cI see no cops here because they never did nothing for anything that I went through,\u201d he said. \u201cI lost everything, the closest family I have.\u201d\n\u201cI feel everybody\u2019s pain around here. It\u2019s pretty hard that you have to go through these situations,\u201d he added. \u201cMy mom was a mom to a lot of people. I know that she\u2019s always going to be with me.\u201d\nCarlick left the tent in tears. The family members that had been testifying about their loved one, manslaughter victim Evangeline Billy, appeared shaken and a break was taken.\nAll are welcome at the community hearings, said Bernee Bolton, the inquiry\u2019s spokeswoman.\n\u201cThis individual recently lost his mother and although he was not scheduled to speak today, we did expect him at some time. He had something to say and the family supported family by giving him space to speak,\u201d she said.\nThese occurrences are to be expected, which is why health supports are in place, she added.\n\u201cThis is all part of the healing and truth telling process.\u201d\nWendy Carlick became an advocate for slain indigenous women after her daughter was murdered, said family friend Diane Lilley. Angel Carlick\u2019s body was found in a wooded area in 2007 and her killing has not been solved, the Whitehorse Daily Star reported.\nThe newspaper reported that Wendy Carlick was one of two women found dead in a Whitehorse home in late April. The RCMP is investigating the deaths as homicides.\n\u201cI can understand why Alex is feeling the way he is because he\u2019s all alone now,\u201d said Lilley. \u201cWendy was a beautiful soul.\u201d\nLilley said she followed Carlick out of the tent and spoke to him outside, where he was extremely distraught. Two of his family members came to comfort him and take him away, she said.\nShe said she was proud of him for finding the courage to speak.\n\u201cI think that was really, really brave of him to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though he interrupted, I\u2019m really, really glad that he did that.\u201d\nThe incident highlights the raw emotions at the hearings, which began Tuesday. Testimony has been intense and tearful, with many relatives presenting family photographs of lost loved ones to the commissioners and speaking passionately about their legacies.\nOne family member urged the inquiry to recommend the RCMP apologize to indigenous people.\nEdna Deerunner said she believes her father killed her mother, Annie Dick, in Porter Creek, Yukon, in the mid-1950s. Deerunner was just five years old at the time and said her father never faced justice.\n\u201cI think it would help us so much to have an apology to our people. I really think that would be powerful for us.\u201d\nThe RCMP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSome families and advocates have expressed concerns about the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference regarding police. The commissioners don\u2019t have the power to compel officers to reopen cold cases, but are examining systemic issues in the justice system.\nCommissioner Qajaq Robinson asked Deerunner what sort of apology she is looking for.\n\u201cI want it to be a thorough one,\u201d Deerunner replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a fact that we were treated terribly. We are still being treated terribly. So somehow we need to rebuild some kind of relationship where communication happens.\u201d\nChief commissioner Marion Buller has said previously that the inquiry will need more time and more money to complete its work, but has not said how much is needed or when the request will be made to the federal government.\nThe federal government gave the commissioners a budget of about $53.9 million and asked them to complete their work by the end of 2018, but most family hearings will not take place until this fall.\n \u2013  Follow @ellekane on Twitter.\n000000000000\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n\n Facebook\n Twitter\n YouTube\n\n\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nSubscription Services\nArchive\n \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nThe Lethbridge Herald\nOther Publications\nFood For Thought\n Contact\nCareers\n \n\n\nContact the Lethbridge Herald\n\n504 - 7th Street South\n\t\t\t\t\tLethbridge, AB T1J 3Z7\n[P] (403) 328-4411\n[F] (403)328-4536\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrint Advertising: (403) 328-4410\n\t\t\t\t\tNational Advertising: (403) 380-7585\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Advertising: (403) 380-7585\n\t\t\t\t\tClassifieds: (403) 328-4433\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2017 The Lethbridge Herald, A Division of Continental Newspapers Canada Ltd.\nAdvertising\nTerms and Conditions & Privacy Policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Airbus will hold a 50.01 per cent interest in the CSeries partnership, Bombardier will own 31 per cent and the Quebec government\u2019s investment agency will hold 19 per cent.\n \u2013  \u2013  \u2013 \nLIBERALS TO TRIM SMALL-BIZ TAXES AMID BACKLASH\nFacing a self-inflicted wound over its proposed tax changes, the Trudeau government has resurrected a campaign promise to cut taxes for small businesses. The rate will fall to 10 per cent in January 2018 and again to nine per cent in 2019. Doctors, lawyers, farmers and others have denounced the tax proposals, contending they\u2019d hurt the very middle class Prime Minister Trudeau claims to be trying to help.\n \u2013  \u2013  \u2013 \nMOTHER RECOUNTS DAUGHTER\u2019S KIDNAPPING\nHer voice is shaky, a tremor that developed from stress that belies the strength of a desperate mother. To say that Lorinda Stewart lived through agony barely gets at the horrific ordeal she endured during the 460 days her daughter Amanda Lindhout was a hostage to ransom-demanding thugs in Somalia. Nor would it be right to assume the nightmare ended with their reunification. It was, in fact, just another beginning.\n \u2013  \u2013  \u2013 \nBELOVED \u2018TRAILER PARK BOYS\u2019 ACTOR DIES AT 71\nJohn Dunsworth, known for his portrayal of Jim Lahey in the comedy series \u201cTrailer Park Boys\u201d and revered as a brilliant actor with a warm heart, has died at the age of 71. The news was confirmed in a statement posted on his Twitter feed Monday evening. His family says the actor died after a \u201cshort and unexpected illness.\u201d Condolences have poured in over social media, from fellow actors, comedians and musicians.\n \u2013  \u2013  \u2013 \nMETIS WANT RECOGNITION FOR VETERANS\nThe president of the Metis National Council is urging Ottawa to formally recognize the contribution of Metis veterans in the Second World War before it is too late for remaining survivors to find redress and get post-war benefits. The timing is important because the ranks of surviving veterans are dwindling, said Clement Chartier. Many who advocated on this issue over the last 30 years have already died.\n \u2013  \u2013  \u2013 \nCLASSES REMAIN CLOSED FOR ONTARIO COLLEGE STUDENTS\nClasses remain cancelled for about half a million students in Ontario due to a strike by faculty at the province\u2019s 24 colleges. The labour dispute involving more than 12,000 professors, instructors, counsellors, and librarians began late Sunday, after the two sides couldn\u2019t resolve their differences. Both sides say there are no talks scheduled to end the dispute. Many night classes continue despite the walkout.\n \u2013  \u2013  \u2013 \nONTARIO BILL WOULD BAN MANDATORY HEELS AT WORK\nAn Ontario Liberal will introduce a bill today to ban the province\u2019s employers from requiring women to wear high heels at work. The private member\u2019s bill from Cristina Martins would amend the Occupational Health and Safety Act to protect workers from being required to wear unsafe footwear as part of dress and uniform codes. British Columbia has already banned mandatory high heels in the workplace.\n \u2013  \u2013  \u2013 \nALSO IN THE NEWS TODAY:\n \u2013  The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls continues holding a hearing in Winnipeg.\n \u2013  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne and Mayor John Tory meet in Toronto.\n \u2013  CP Rail will release its third-quarter results.\n \u2013  Leadership candidates for the United Conservative Party stage a debate in Lethbridge, Alta.\n \u2013  Trial continues in Ottawa for Ali Omar Ader, charged in kidnapping of journalist Amanda Lindhout.\n \u2013  Trial also continues in Ottawa for Basil Borutski, charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of three women in 2015.\n \u2013  The Fraser Institute will release a report examining electricity costs and jobs in Ontario\u2019s manufacturing sector.\n \u2013  Archeologists will unveil what they found while digging at the site of a pre-Confederation parliament in Montreal.\n0000000000\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n\n Twitter\n Facebook\n Instagram\n YouTube\n Tumblr\n\n\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nArchive\n \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nThe Medicine Hat News\nOther Publications\n Contact\nCareers\n \n\n\nContact the Medicine Hat News\n\n3257 Dunmore Rd SE\n\t\t\t\t\tMedicine Hat, AB T1B 3R2\n[P] 403.527.1101\n[F] 403.528.5696\n\n\nContact\nCareers\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrint Advertising: 403.528.5659\n\t\t\t\t\tNational Advertising: 403.528.5766\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Advertising: 403.528.5698\n\t\t\t\t\tClassifieds: 403.526.7653\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2017 The Medicine Hat News, A Division of Continental Newspapers Canada Ltd.\nAdvertising\nTerms and Conditions & Privacy policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The siblings from Carmacks, Yukon, were separated in the \u201960s Scoop, when indigenous children were taken from their parents and placed in non-indigenous homes.\nWashpan, whose adopted name was Cindy Burk, became involved in the sex trade. Her body was found near the Alaska Highway in 1990 and in 2009, a British Columbia man was found guilty of second-degree murder in her death.\nToday, Lilley still has questions.\n\u201cWhy did it take 20 years for my sister\u2019s killer to be found?\nWhat was the reason?\u201d she asked. \u201cThere are a lot of family members who are missing their loved ones and they need answers.\u201d\nLilley is among the dozens of relatives of missing and murdered indigenous women who are expected to share their stories with a national inquiry in Whitehorse where a ceremony will be held today (Monday) \u00c2\u00a0before community hearings start Tuesday. The hearings begin as the inquiry faces intense criticism from families and indigenous groups across Canada about poor communications and delays.\nIn Whitehorse, families and advocates feel a mixture of hope and anxiety. People who\u2019ve lost loved ones are eager to finally share their experiences but have questions about how their stories will be used, advocates say, while the short timeline is prompting fears that families outside the city will be left out.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about it, that we\u2019re the first one in Canada, but I feel like sometimes we\u2019re being rushed,\u201d said Lilley. \u201cWe get last minute notice. There\u2019s not very much planning.\u201d\nDoris Anderson, president of the Yukon Aboriginal Women\u2019s Council, recently lost her cousin Sarah MacIntosh to a suspected homicide. Anderson expressed fears that not enough \u201cafter care\u201d\u00c2\u00a0would be provided to families who are set to relive their trauma.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard when a family member comes up and says to me, \u2018OK, now what? I\u2019m going home but there\u2019s nothing in my little community to help me,\u2019 \u201d she said.\nInquiry spokeswoman Bernee Bolton said a health team has met with families and survivors across the territory to make sure they have the help they need and have been offered a support person to be with them when they speak.\nThe inquiry\u2019s legal team has also explained the process and offered a range of options for participation, including speaking publicly at the hearings, talking privately to a statement-taker or providing art or a self-recorded video, she said.\nAbout 40 people are expected to share stories in a range of formats, Bolton said, adding that the commission could return to Yukon in the future.\nChief commissioner Marion Buller stressed the importance of mental-health supports in an interview.\n\u201cIt is not just as straightforward as picking up a phone for example and talking to a statement-taker. The health team has to get involved in there, too,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is traumatic for a lot of people.\u201d\nA sacred fire lighting at sunrise was scheduled for Monday before a traditional feast and cultural program in the evening. On Tuesday, hearings begin inside an outdoor tent at the Kwanlin Dun Cultural Centre and conclude Thursday with a closing ceremony.\n\u00a0\nOther community meetings have been delayed until fall, but the first hearings are going ahead in Whitehorse because of the willingness on the part of the people there, said Buller.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe wanted to honour the North because so often the North gets left out,\u201d she added.\n\u00a0\nYukon has also formed an advisory committee that aims to ensure that families, First Nations and **>aboriginal<** women\u2019s groups are meaningfully included in the inquiry. It potentially helped pave the way for Whitehorse to be the first stop, said advisory committee co-chair Jeanie Dendys, who is also the minister responsible for the women\u2019s directorate in Yukon.\n\u00a0\nForty-one indigenous women have gone missing or been murdered in the territory over several decades, said Dendys.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe impact is profound,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a really small population in Yukon, so there are a lot of really strong personal connections and when someone is lost to violence, it impacts our entire community.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCommittee interim co-chair Krista Reid, president of the Whitehorse **>Aboriginal<** Women\u2019s Circle, said the inquiry has been a bit rushed and communications have been flawed, but the commission has been responsive to concerns.\n\u00a0\nReid said her group has begun to call the commissioners \u201cgrandmothers,\u201d who will hopefully comfort, nurture and listen to families.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what will happen, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re hoping for,\u201d she said. \u201cWe definitely don\u2019t want to see some report on the shelf.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut if we don\u2019t have that evidence-based data that they\u2019re here to find, it\u2019s just going to be another violent case, another dead Indian. We don\u2019t want that anymore.\u201d\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story? We'd like to hear from you about this or any other stories you think we should know about.

The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal says \u2018limited interested person status\u2019 will allow government to give relevant information about police services in BC.\nPhoto via BC government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB.C.\u2019s attorney general has been denied full party status in an ongoing Canadian Human Rights Tribunal inquiry into the RCMP\u2019s handling of historical abuse allegations at northern B.C. schools.\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncements, Events & more from Tyee and select partners\nCONTEST: Win Tickets to Handel\u2019s \u2018Messiah\u2019\n\nOne lucky Tyee reader will get a pair of tickets to see conductor Alexander Weimann bring this holiday classic to Vancouver this December.\nThe Tyee Is 20. So We\u2019re Partying by Debating the Fate of Journalism\n\nEnd of news? Come cheer and boo as media heroes argue it out at our big birthday bash Nov. 30.\n\n Instead, the tribunal granted the province \u201climited interested person status,\u201d saying this status would be enough to allow B.C. to provide relevant information on policing in the province as it pertains to changes requested by the complainants concerning the way abuse investigations are handled in Indigenous communities. \n\u201cThe [B.C. attorney general] has asked to be involved in the proceedings for the specific purpose of providing the tribunal with relevant information relating to remedies sought by the complainants,\u201d CHRT Chair Colleen Harrington wrote in the Nov. 15 decision. \u201cThis ruling facilitates that, albeit under a different rule.\u201d \nHarrington added that she was going ahead with the decision, rather than asking for additional submissions from the parties, in the interest of time. \n\n\n\n\nSix members of the Lake Babine Nation initially filed their complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission in January 2017. The commission investigated and referred it for inquiry in 2020. \n\n\n\n\n\n After a series of delays, hearings got underway in Burns Lake on May 1, 2023. They continued online in June and were initially expected to last just six weeks. Additional dates were set throughout the fall to hear from more witnesses, including experts speaking to remedies sought by the complainants. \nThree of six named complainants for the inquiry have died in the years leading up to the hearings.  \nThe hearings are currently expected to wrap up next month. \n\nOne public interest remedy requested by the complainants asks that the RCMP divest itself of abuse investigations in Indigenous communities, replacing them with independent investigation teams that would include a language speaker, an Elder and a spiritual leader, among other members. The complainants have also adopted a recommendation from an expert witness at the inquiry that the team include one RCMP officer, Harrington\u2019s Nov. 15 decision said. \nCounsel for the attorney general wrote to the tribunal on July 26, the decision said, nearly three months after hearings began, saying the proceeding \u201chad recently been brought to their attention\u201d by lawyers with the federal Department of Justice, which is representing the RCMP at the hearings. B.C.\u2019s attorney general then notified the CHRT that it would apply for party status \u201cat the earliest possible opportunity.\u201d \nThe attorney general filed its application for party status on Sept. 19, saying that policing is done through a series of agreements between the province and RCMP and that it had \u201ca genuine and substantial interest\u201d in the proceeding. \nHarrington noted that it took the province almost two months to file its application after notifying the tribunal that it had been made aware of the hearings. She added that she was not aware of the attorney general attending any proceedings or requesting transcripts of testimony that has already taken place.\n\u201cIn this case, given the late stage of the proceedings and the fact that it is a large government entity, the [B.C. attorney general] should have allocated resources to ensure its motion was filed in a timely manner,\u201d she wrote. \nThe limited interested person status Harrington has granted restricts the attorney general\u2019s participation to cross-examining witnesses and filing written submissions related to the public interest remedies sought by the First Nations complainants.\nFull party status would have also allowed the province to file motions, request adjournments and call witnesses. \nThe status granted to B.C.\u2019s attorney general is the same as that granted to the man at the centre of the RCMP\u2019s decade-old investigation. While the man initially sought party status in an effort to have the inquiry thrown out, he was instead granted limited interested person status for the purpose of applying for anonymity. \nHe was granted that anonymity last year and is now referred to in tribunal documents as A.B. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED STORIES\nDeep into a Human Rights Inquiry, BC Asks to Weigh In \n\nA.B. taught at Immaculata Catholic school in Burns Lake in the late 1960s before moving on to Prince George College in 1970. He is accused by former students of physically and mentally abusing First Nations children at the school. \nOne former student, who is from the Lake Babine First Nation, accused him of sexually abusing her when she was 11 years old. She took her allegations to the Burns Lake police detachment on July 11, 2012. \nInternal RCMP communications shared with the tribunal show that two days after the woman gave her statement, an RCMP briefing note describing A.B. as a \u201cwell-known Canadian\u201d who had \u201crisen to prominence [and] remained prominent\u201d was circulated among RCMP brass, including then-commissioner Bob Paulson. According to one internal communication shared with the tribunal, this memo was also shared with A.B.\u2019s legal team, which kept in close contact with the RCMP\u2019s lead investigator throughout the investigation.\nThe tribunal heard that a secondary file was created to investigate broader abuse allegations at Immaculata school and that some witnesses alleging abuse by A.B. who attended Prince George College were shuffled to the alternate file and never interviewed. \nThe RCMP did not recommend charges against A.B., instead determining there was insufficient evidence to corroborate the woman\u2019s story.\nThe complainants allege that RCMP discriminated against them and other Indigenous people in its investigation by not making accommodations for First Nations people\u2019s distrust of the RCMP, which is rooted in part in the national police force\u2019s role in forcing Indigenous children to attend residential schools.\nIn the recent decision, Harrington determined that granting the B.C. attorney general\u2019s application would \u201cseriously prejudice\u201d the complainants by causing harm through additional legal costs and further delays. \nShe also noted the attorney general\u2019s desire to participate was \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d when the complaint was first made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep into a Human Rights Inquiry, BC Asks to Weigh In\n\tread more \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe complainants note that this application comes after an extensive amount of evidence has been heard by the Tribunal, but the [B.C. attorney general] does not even indicate if it has reviewed the transcripts of that evidence or if it has knowledge of the details of this matter,\u201d Harrington wrote. \nWhile recognizing that the province\u2019s participation could assist in determining remedies \u201cif there is a finding of discrimination against the RCMP,\u201d Harrington added that it wasn\u2019t necessary for the attorney general to be a party in order to provide input. \n\u201cThe value that the [B.C. attorney general] may bring to the tribunal\u2019s proceedings aligns much more closely with the factors the tribunal considers when determining whether someone should be made an interested person in the proceeding,\u201d Harrington wrote.\n\u201cI accept that the [B.C. attorney general] has an interest in a potential finding of discrimination against the RCMP, which provides policing services in the province, and that the requested remedies may have an impact on provincial responsibilities relating to policing and victim services.\u201d \n Read more:\u00a0Indigenous, Rights + Justice  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nShare article via email\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend this article to:\n\n\n\nYour email address:\n\n\n\nYour message:\n\n\n\nWould you like to receive The Tyee's headlines free by email?\n\n\n\n                                    Yes, every day.\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Yes, once a week.\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Yes, once a week, national news only.\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    I already subscribe.\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    No, thanks.\n                                \n\n\n\nSubmit\n\nShow form again \u00bb\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacts matter.

The action has not yet been certified and, while the allegations have not been proven in court, her story and those of other cases are familiar.Danita Faith BigEagle went missing from Regina on Feb. 11, 2007. She has not been found. Her mother, Diane BigEagle, is launching a class action lawsuit alleging the RCMP has been systemically negligent.\u00a0\u00a0(National Centre for Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains)BigEagle\u2019s daughter went missing from Regina on Feb. 11, 2007, and \u201cmust be presumed to be dead,\u201d reads the claim. BigEagle met with the RCMP more than 50 times and \u201cseemed to listen\u201d on a couple of occasions \u201cbut most of the time they did not write anything down and they did not seem to be paying any attention to her,\u201d the suit alleges.It also states that BigEagle, in a number of group meetings held by the RCMP, was with other families of murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls. Born in 1984, her daughter, if alive, would be 34 today. BigEagle has been caring for her daughter\u2019s two children.The suit, filed in Federal Court, was brought on behalf of immediate and extended family of murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls. In the case of murders, the homicide must have been reported to the RCMP and remain unsolved. Missing women must have been gone for more than 30 days and the disappearance reported to the RCMP.Article Continued Below\u201cThe unacceptably high rates of violence against Indigenous women and girls is well documented and known both nationally and internationally and has drawn criticism from national and international human rights watchdogs,\u201d reads the lawsuit. \u201cThese calls for action have been in practical effect ignored\u201d by the RCMP.Under a heading of \u201cSystemic Negligence,\u201d the suit alleges the members of the class have been \u201csubjected to unnecessary and preventable mental anguish through the failures of the RCMP to adhere to RCMP duties, including a failure to properly investigate and prosecute the disappearances and murders of victims.\u201dThe RCMP was not transparent, provided inadequate investigative training to officers and created or tolerated \u201cattitudes of racism\u201d by members, which \u201ccreated the stereotypical thinking that resulted in inadequate investigations, the suit alleges. This created mistrust by Indigenous people, which \u201cinterfered\u201d with investigations, according to the claim, which says the issues are \u201congoing\u201d and breach the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.As a result, the proposed action claims class members have suffered and continue to suffer from depression, anxiety, post-traumatic disorder, suicidal ideation, loss of opportunity and loss of income.The RCMP \u201cdefends its track record regarding these women and girls by painting them as being more vulnerable and at a disproportionately higher risk for exposure to these perils,\u201d states the action. It cites RCMP reporting of stats on alcohol or drug consumption before the incident, which \u201cought to have been an irrelevant consideration.\u201dAn RCMP spokesperson said late Thursday afternoon that the lawsuit had just been received and there had not been an opportunity to review it thoroughly, and that it was too early to address specifics.Included in the suit are summaries of 36 \u201chigh profile\u201d cases of murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls from across the country, including Sharon Nora Jane Abraham, 39, a mother of five from Sagkeeng First Nation in Manitoba. She was reported missing in British Columbia in 2004 and linked by forensic evidence \u2014 a fingernail, according to family \u2014 to serial killer Robert Picton\u2019s farm. No charges were laid in that case.Article Continued BelowTony Merchant, the lead lawyer on the claim, said the decision to launch the legal action against the RCMP now came after BigEagle and others dropped in on the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Women and Girls on its recent stop in Regina. BigEagle got the \u201creal sense that this wasn\u2019t going anywhere quickly,\u201d said Merchant. \u201cThe inquiry coming to Regina just resulted in \u2018enough is enough, this isn\u2019t working. I will now turn to the courts for their help.\u2019\u201dBigEagle could not be reached Thursday.Of the $600 million in damages being sought, $100 million is for punitive damages.\u201cWe\u2019re really asking the court to send a message to the RCMP and policing, generally, that they have to find methods that work, and we prove that what they are doing does not work, statistically,\u201d said Merchant.The next step for the suit will be collecting more stories and plaintiffs, and certification, said Merchant, whose firm has launched class actions around residential schools and the 60\u2019s scoop.TOP STORIES, DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX.NEW NEWSLETTERHEADLINESSIGN UPMore from The Star & PartnersLOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

FIRST NATION, Man. - Thelma Favel woke up every morning before going to the Winnipeg courthouse, looked around her room and wondered what her grand-niece might have thought when she stayed in the same hotel in her final weeks alive.During the second-degree murder trial for Raymond Cormier \u2014 the man acquitted last month of killing Tina Fontaine \u2014 Favel wanted to put herself in the teenage girl's shoes.Favel stayed in the same downtown hotel where the young girl was placed by Child and Family Services and walked the same streets where Tina was last seen alive.\"I just found strength every day to get up and go. I walked the hallways, wondering which room she was in,\" Favel told The Canadian Press. \"I just felt so close to her there.\"Security camera footage was shown in court of Tina falling asleep between two cars behind a building named after Helen Betty Osborne \u2014 a Cree woman kidnapped and killed in Manitoba in 1971. Favel went there, too.\"I just don't know what happened to her that month-and-a-half (in Winnipeg). I just don't know what happened at all.\"Tina spent much of her young life living with Favel on the Sagkeeng First Nation, north of Winnipeg. She was a kind girl who liked to study math and science, Favel said. She had a lot of friends and never got into trouble.But after her father was murdered in 2011, Tina had difficulty coping. She left the First Nation in June 2014 to reconnect with her mother in Winnipeg. When Favel didn't hear from the girl, she called Child and Family Services for help.In the following weeks, 15-year-old Tina disappeared multiple times, returned to government care and was placed in a hotel.Her 72-pound body, wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down by rocks, was pulled from the Red River that August.Her death renewed calls for a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and inspired volunteer groups such as the Bear Clan Patrol to protect the vulnerable on the streets.Favel said she had faith in the justice system as she sat in court nearly every day throughout the more than three-week trial. She listened to testimony from experts and from people who knew Tina in Winnipeg. She heard audio of Cormier himself, recorded by police during a six-month undercover operation.When Tina's voice from a 911 call was played in court, Favel said she \"just wanted to hear her over and over and over again.\"\"Tina was with me. She was there with me every single day and I had my rosaries around my hand every day. That's where I got my strength. I had to do it for Tina,\" said Favel, breaking into tears.\"Her voice was stolen. She was silenced forever so I had to be there to be her pillar of hope, to get justice for her. Even that I failed at.\"After a jury acquitted Cormier, rallies were held across the country for Tina. But Favel and her family are left wondering how Tina died and whether she will ever get justice.\n\n\n\n\nFavel is exhausted and her husband has suffered two strokes \u2014 one right after Tina's body was found and another when the trial started.\"I thought he was the strong one, but big men do crumble because she captured his heart,\" Favel said. \"Tina was his heart.\"Tina was tiny but powerful, Favel said. The teen's family has found strength in the way her life and death have become a rallying cry for change.Favel is not optimistic the acquittal will be appealed and said she would like to see other charges laid against Cormier. If there is an inquest or inquiry into Tina's death, Favel said she will still be there every step of the way.Talking about Tina still hurts \u2014 it's a reminder of a young, promising life taken too soon. But Favel said she knows it's important because \"God had other plans for Tina.\"\"She was silenced but still her cries are being heard everywhere. This is not over yet. She is going to do something about all of this wrong that is going on.\"\u2014 By Kelly Geraldine Malone in Winnipeg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nNational\n \nSocial\n \nJustice\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nPost a comment as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmoticons \n\n\n[smile]\n[beam]\n[wink]\n[sad]\n[cool]\n[innocent]\n[rolleyes]\n[whistling]\n[lol]\n[huh]\n[tongue]\n[love]\n[sleeping]\n[yawn]\n[unsure]\n[angry]\n[blink]\n[crying]\n[ohmy]\n[scared]\n[sleep]\n[sneaky]\n[tongue_smile]\n[thumbdown]\n[thumbup]\n[censored]\n[happybirthday]\n[ban]\n[spam]\n[offtopic]\n[batman]\n[ninja]\n[pirate]\n[alien]\n\n\n\nComment Text\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\nPost comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nReport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\nReport Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nWatch this discussion.\nStop watching this discussion.\n\n\n\n\nWatch this discussion\n\n\n\n\n                            Get an email notification whenever someone contributes to the discussion\n                        \n\n                            Notifications from this discussion will be disabled.\n                        \n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\n\nStart watching\nStop watching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (0) comments \n                            \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the discussion.\n\n\nLog In\n\n\n\nKeep it Clean.

and Maryam Monsef, Status of Women minister at Tuesday morning\u2019s news conference on the extension of the national MMIWG inquiry)\u00a0\nJustin Brake\nAPTN News\nThe head of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls says \u201cpolitical expediency\u201d is at the heart of Canada\u2019s decision to deny the commission an extra two years to complete its work.\n\u201cIn seeking a two-year extension we were striking a balance between the urgency of the issues and the need to do this work thoroughly,\u201d Buller said in a statement after the announcement.\n\u201cNow we believe political expediency has been placed before the safety of Indigenous women, girls,\u00a0and 2SLGBTQ people.\u201d\nOn Tuesday Crown-Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett announced Canada will grant the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls only six months to complete its work.\nThe Inquiry\u2019s commissioners are now mandated to submit a final report by April 30, 2019.\nRead the inquiry\u2019s statement here:\u00a0Short extension injustice to families, survivors,\u00a0and Canada\nIn March, the inquiry requested a two-year extension and an extra $50 million in funding to complete its mandate of reaching victims and families, and of examining the social, cultural, economic, institutional and historical roots of the ongoing violence against Indigenous women and girls.\nThe commission was initially given two years and $53.8 million to complete the Inquiry.\nTuesday\u2019s announcement falls far short of the\u00a0request, despite Bennett calling the crisis of violence against women and girls a \u201cnational tragedy\u201d and a \u201ctop priority\u201d.\nBennett says the decision to grant just a six-month extension is informed by the wishes of families and survivors, who Bennett repeated numerous times during Tuesday\u2019s press conference wanted the Inquiry completed \u201cin a timely way.\u201d\nShe said the decision also came as a result of not being able to achieve a consensus among the provinces and territories to grant the Inquiry its requested two-year extension.\n\u201cWithout an extension in terms of [the provinces and territories\u2019] orders in council, we would have lost the national public inquiry,\u201d Bennett explained.\nShe would not disclose which provinces or territories rejected the two-year extension, saying the intergovernmental discussions are \u201cprivate conversations\u201d.\nBennett said the decision to further finance the inquiry to complete its mandate won\u2019t be hers, but that any decisions will come from further discussions with the commissioners.\nWhile any new money for the inquiry still has to be worked out, Tuesday\u2019s announcement included almost $50 million in government funding for programs and services identified in the inquiry\u2019s interim report last November.\nBuller told APTN News in an interview that reaction from families and survivors was swift, and that many are \u201cdevastated\u201d and were \u201cexpecting more in the way of time and resources to address the issues that they have fought so long and hard for.\u201d\nBuller said families and survivors are \u201cupset that politics have been put ahead of our women and girls once again.\u201d\n\u201cI know right now that we will not be able to have our regional hearings across Canada in each of the provinces and territories,\u201d she explained.\n\u201cWe have found across Canada that there are regional issues that need to be addressed and issues that come under provincial and territorial jurisdiction specifically, like child welfare off reserve, like education, healthcare and policing.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to have those regional hearings because of the lack of time.\u201d\nBuller doesn\u2019t buy Bennett\u2019s claim that families and survivors don\u2019t support the Inquiry\u2019s requested two-year extension and said the commissioners have \u201cheard differently.\u201d\nShe also said she\u2019s \u201cdisappointed\u201d that provinces and territories have reportedly not supported the inquiry\u2019s request.\nAs part of the government\u2019s announced funding, Indigenous Services Canada will invest $21.3 million to expand health support services to for families and survivors who participate in the Inquiry, as well as those impacted by the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\nAnother $5.42 million will be invested in 2019 and 2020 to extend the timeframe for the Department of Justice\u2019s Family Information Liaison Units and community-based organizations to support families beyond the life of the Inquiry.\nThe feds are also accepting the inquiry\u2019s recommendation for a commemoration fund and will provide $10 million over two years through Status of Women Canada to \u201chonour the lives and legacies of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and LGBTQ2S individuals.\u201d\nAnd $9.6 million will be invested over five years to support the RCMP\u2019s new National Investigative Standards and Practices Unit, which includes oversight of investigations into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\nStatus of Women Minister Maryam Monsef reiterated Bennett\u2019s emphasis on putting families first.\n\u201cWe said from the beginning that we wouldn\u2019t wait until the end of the inquiry to act, and as Minister Bennett said: Ultimately this is about preventing tragedies like this from happening. This is about ensuring that survivors and their families have the supports they need \u2014that the legal systems and the justice systems in place are responsive.\u201d\nConservative Indigenous Affairs critic Cathy McLeod said the Liberals \u201cclearly\u201d want the Inquiry completed before the 2019 election, but hopes \u201cpolitical calculus\u201d did not weigh on the decision.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, this needs to bring closure and peace to the families and it needs to give us a path forward,\u201d she said, adding she\u2019s waiting to hear more details on what additional funds the government will provide and how the commissioners will use the extra six months.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing a lot of concerns in terms of the red tape, the bureaucracy, the phone numbers that haven\u2019t worked, so to give more time and it\u2019s more of the same \u2014 that\u2019s not effective for the families,\u201d she said. \u201cThey now have a deadline.\u201d\nThe NDP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBuller said the inquiry will \u201chear from families and survivors who have already registered with us,\u201d and that the commissioners \u201cknow that we have to do more research.\n\u201cWe know that we have to support our research team in filling in the blanks of the work that has to be done and the information that we have to receive.\u201d\nBut she\u2019s not optimistic that they will be able to reach as many of the most marginalized Indigenous women in Canada as they would like, such as those who are incarcerated or living in shelters.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to go back and rethink our strategy regarding the more marginalized communities because we need to do more work there to build on the work that we\u2019ve already done.\u201d\nBuller said the commission has \u201ca full agenda\u201d and will \u201cbe working to fill it out as best we can within the existing extension period.\u201d\njbrake@aptn.ca\n@JustinBrakeNews\n\n\nTags: Carolyn Bennett, extension, Featured, Inquiry, National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls\n\n\n\nJustin

File photo by Alex T\u00e9treault \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious story \n\n\n\n\n\nListen to article\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Canadian government appointed an adviser Tuesday to help with the creation of an Indigenous and human rights ombudsperson.The announcement comes more than three years after the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit Peoples (MMIWG2S) delivered its findings and months after four women were killed in Winnipeg. When the office is created, the ombudsperson will have the authority to receive complaints from Indigenous communities and conduct independent evaluations of government services for Indigenous Peoples, the final report for the MMIWG2S inquiry says.Jennifer Moore Rattray, a member of the Peepeekisis First Nation and former executive director of the national inquiry, will advise Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Marc Miller to help create the ombudsperson role, which was one of the calls to justice in the inquiry\u2019s final report.Get daily news from Canada's National Observer Email * Miller made the virtual announcement on Jan. 10 following an afternoon-long virtual roundtable with national, provincial and territorial representatives. Participants hailed from governments and advocacy groups, and the session was led by the Crown-Indigenous relations minister.Miller also announced that Innovation 7, an Indigenous organization focusing on consultation and reconciliation, was chosen to develop recommendations for an oversight mechanism to \u201cenhance accountability and progress in ending violence towards Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQI+ people,\u201d according to a government press release.  In a press conference after the announcement, Miller told Canada\u2019s National Observer he does not have a timeline for the creation of the ombudsperson role. Instead, he deferred to Rattray\u2019s expertise and her required time to conduct proper consultation.Canada\u2019s National Observer asked the minister why it took more than three years to appoint the adviser who will help develop an ombudsperson role. It\u2019s frustrating to watch time elapse, Miller said, but he \u201ccan\u2019t singlehandedly, in one fell swoop, appoint an ombudsperson without the proper consultation with survivor groups and families.\u201d What people are reading               Free speech isn\u2019t what Jordan Peterson thinks it is By Max Fawcett\u00a0|\u00a0Opinion, Politics\u00a0| January 10th 2023      \u201cIf you look into Jennifer\u2019s CV, that is someone who will inform me what the next steps are for an ombudsperson,\u201d he said.Carol McBride, president of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, was at the roundtable meeting and called it \u201ca good start.\u201d Everyone in the meeting was happy to finally have a forum to share knowledge and experiences across regions, she added.McBride hopes the meetings continue on a regular basis. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, then we lose the momentum that we started today,\u201d she said in an interview.  Following a virtual roundtable with provincial, territorial and national representatives and advocates, Minister Marc Miller announced advisory roles to steward the Calls to Justice from the national inquiry's final report. #Reconciliation #CanPoli      Last June, the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada gave the government a failing grade on implementing its MMIWG2S national action plan. The association will likely publish its 2023 scorecard in June, said McBride.\u201cLet\u2019s just see where it goes from here.\u201dMatteo Cimellaro / Canada\u2019s National Observer / Local Journalism Initiative  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 11th 2023\n\n\n \n\n\nMatteo Cimellaro\nReporter \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep reading \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCanadians think clean energy is more affordable and secure than fossil fuels: poll\nBy Natasha Bulowski\u00a0|\u00a0News, Energy, Ottawa Insider\u00a0|\nJanuary 10th 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nA luxury fishing lodge vacation, flights on a private jet and the close relationship between a premier, town councillors and a billionaire angling to build a hydrogen plant\nBy John Woodside\u00a0|\u00a0Analysis, Politics\u00a0|\nJanuary 10th 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCanada\u2019s only underground coal mine racks up new safety violations months after reopening\nBy Cloe Logan\u00a0|\u00a0News\u00a0|\nJanuary 9th 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInvestigation: Oil giants who \u2018make more money than God\u2019 lobbied the federal government and got $2.6 billion in taxpayer dollars\nBy Tracy Sherlock & Xavier Richer Vis\u00a0|\u00a0Investigations\u00a0|\nJanuary 9th 2023\nThe Influencers \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this articleShare\u00a0on FacebookShare\u00a0on Twitter\n\n\n\nComments \n\n\nSubscribe to join the conversation.

Buller admitted that communication has been lacking and the inquiry still has not hired a full contingent  of staff.\u00a0\u00a0(Sean Kilpatrick / THE CANADIAN PRESS)\u00a0\u00a0By Alex BallingallOttawa BureauThu., Sept. 21, 2017OTTAWA\u2014The head of the inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls said Thursday that she plans to ask the government for more time to complete their work, but would not say how much is needed or whether the inquiry\u2019s $54-million budget will still be enough. Marion Buller, the B.C. judge who is heading the inquiry, also acknowledged that \u201ccommunication has been lacking\u201d during the process so far and that \u2014 almost a year into the inquiry\u2019s 28-month mandate \u2014 a full contingent of staff still hasn\u2019t been hired. She blamed the Privy Council Office, the government branch that oversees the inquiry, for bureaucratic processes that have slowed progress. \u201cTime is always ticking for us, so if it takes a month or two months to get a computer, if it takes a month of two months to hire someone, that\u2019s 10 per cent, 20 per cent of our time,\u201d Buller told a panel of MPs at the House of Commons\u2019 Indigenous affairs committee, where she answered questions alongside the inquiry\u2019s three other commissioners. She did not say when she will ask for an extended mandate, and added that it is \u201cpremature\u201d to say whether the inquiry will need more money.Article Continued Below\u201cThe end of our work is approaching us very quickly, and every day counts,\u201d she said. Sabrina Williams, spokesperson for Indigenous-Crown Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett, said in an emailed statement that the Privy Council Office is already in contact with the inquiry to resolve any issues. \u201cThis inquiry is a vital step in ending this national tragedy and to provide justice for victims and healing for families and survivors,\u201d she said. The inquiry was set up last year to study the causes of violence against Indigenous women and girls. According to the inquiry\u2019s website, 16 per cent of women murdered in Canada between 1980 and 2012 were Indigenous, while Indigenous women make up just 4 per cent of the female population. But the inquiry has faced criticism for months, as hearings have been delayed, victims\u2019 families have complained about a lack of communication, and key staff members have walked away from the process. There were originally five people heading the probe for the root causes of violence against Indigenous women and girls, but commissioner Marilyn Poitras stepped down in July amid calls to restart the inquiry. Romeo Saganash, a NDP MP from northern Quebec who sits on the Indigenous affairs committee, said the commissioners\u2019 answers Thursday left him feeling frustrated. \u201cI\u2019m not too sure who to blame at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty worried. A lot of people are asking for a major reset. A lot of people are asking for resignations from this inquiry\u2026 We need a clear path forward here. I didn\u2019t want to hear the uttering of generalities during that hearing.\u201dBuller also said the inquiry is overhauling its communications plan in an \u201caggressive and strategic manner\u201d and that it is \u201cvery close\u201d to having a full slate of staff across the country. Mich\u00e8le Audette, one of the commissioners, added that these changes have helped them sign up 735 families to take part in the inquiry hearings \u2014 up from roughly 400 a few weeks ago. The inquiry has also added a forensics team to analyse how police have investigated cases of murdered or missing Indigenous women.\u201cWe\u2019re not examining buildings. We\u2019re examining lives,\u201d said Qajaq Robinson, another one of the commissioners. \u201cThere are thousands of incidents, not only of disappearances and murders, but of violence\u2026 It\u2019s going to be difficult and I want to just raise my hands for the families that fought for this and want to be heard and want to share.\u201dDelivered dailyThe Morning Headlines\u00a0NewsletterSubscribeThe Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E\u00a01E6.

The third victim whose name is known was Rebecca Contois, and Indigenous leaders are referring to the fourth victim as Buffalo Woman, or Mashkode Bizhiki\u2019ikwe.\nOttawa has promised to fund a study about how to search the landfill site after police initially said a search would not be feasible.\nRecently, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs issued a statement asking for the public to be patient as it says preparing the study is complex, and a second landfill in expected to be included in its scope.\nThe accused killer, Jeremy Skibicki, is facing four first-degree murder charges.\nOn Tuesday, Miller referenced the murders in Winnipeg as evidence of the ongoing pattern of violence. He acknowledged that actions taken since the inquiry\u2019s final report have not been enough to address the crisis.\nHe also announced that Indigenous organization Innovation 7 is being tasked with developing recommendations for an oversight mechanism to help the government track its progress in ending violence against Indigenous women, girls and LGBTQ people.\nThe creation of both an ombudsperson role and an oversight mechanism were among the inquiry\u2019s calls to justice.\nMiller\u2019s department says in a news release that the appointments reaffirm the government\u2019s commitment to meaningful reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.\n\u00a0\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 10, 2023.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

Edmonton Indigenous activist pushing for prison interviews to stop the bloodshedBy Omar MoslehStarMetro EdmontonSun., Jan. 13, 2019EDMONTON\u2014One Edmonton Indigenous activist is making the case that solving the crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls means understanding why men prey on women in the first place.On Wednesday, Muriel Stanley Venne, founder of the Institute for the Advancement of Aboriginal Women, made that very point to Correctional Service Canada as part of the National Aboriginal Advisory Committee. She recommended that Corrections Canada place a greater emphasis on interviewing convicted killers who are locked up to get a better sense of their motivations, their psychology, and, ultimately, to learn more about how society can prevent women from being murdered.Murial Stanley Venne is a long time aboriginal rights advocate.\u00a0\u00a0(Kevin Tuong / For StarMetro Edmonton)Indigenous women are six times more likely to be victims of homicide than non-Indigenous women, according to 2017 numbers from Statistics Canada. An 2014 RCMP report said 1,181 Indigenous women and girls were killed or have disappeared in Canada between 1980 and 2012, although some advocates say the number is closer to 4,000.\u201cWe have the opportunity to turn things around and get good research done so we could take the next steps to prevent these killings,\u201d Venne said after attending the meeting with Correctional Service Canada commissioner Anne Kelly in Laval, Que.\u201cPeople have been saying this for a long time, and I think we\u2019re at an important time in our history where we can really take a serious look at the factors faced by Indigenous women, but equally important is the research (into) how we stop the killers.\u201dArticle Continued BelowExperts believe there are two types of men who kill women, with different motivations. One is serial killers \u2014 the real-life bogeymen who commit incomprehensible acts again and again, preying on the vulnerable for their own sadistic pleasure.And while they occupy a large space in our imagination, they are, in fact, exceedingly rare.\u201cIf we\u2019re talking about the Willy Picktons of the world, we\u2019re talking about a very, very narrow slice,\u201d says Liam Ennis, an Edmonton-based forensic psychologist.He\u2019s referring to Robert William Pickton, the British Columbia pig farmer who confessed to 49 murders, but was only convicted of six, making him one of Canada\u2019s most well-known and prolific serial killers.Ennis has worked extensively on violence risk assessment as well as at dangerous-offender designation hearings. He\u2019s assessed a large number of men who have murdered women.Research shows serial killers are usually individuals who feel isolated, rejected, or humiliated, who tend to use drugs or alcohol, and who are not successful at careers or relationships. Killing gives them a sense of power, Ennis says.\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s driving the behaviour for them, as opposed to most men who murder women, it\u2019s a flash of anger,\u201d Ennis said. \u201cEven if there\u2019s a sexual component to it, it\u2019s an impulsive sort of outburst. Rather than hunting, that sort of predatory, deliberate violence.\u201dArticle Continued BelowEnnis said in the majority of cases where women are murdered (75 per cent of cases), it is by an intimate partner or family member \u2013 not a serial killer. Statistics Canada numbers from 2017 show that Indigenous women are more likely than their counterparts to be killed by an acquaintance or stranger: of the total solved Indigenous female homicides reported to police between 1980 and 2014, 53 per cent were committed by family members.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing unique about that to Indigenous peoples. Women are at most risk from men they are close to, in their own homes, at the hands of men who they\u2019ve had intimate relationships with,\u201d Ennis said.\u201c(On that) we have tons of research, because there\u2019s so many more of those men,\u201d he added. \u201cWe understand those men much better.\u201dMen who kill their partners tend to fall within one of two categories. There are those who have a criminal history, are anti-social and are violent across the board. Then there are those who Ennis says have borderline personality disorder. Edmonton-based Liam Ennis is a psychologist with extensive experience in dealing with murderers and other killers.\u00a0\u00a0(Codie McLachlan/For StarMetro Edmonton)\u201cThe most key characteristic there is this chronic fear of abandonment,\u201d Ennis said. \u201cThey\u2019re always afraid the partner is going to leave them. And they would rather break all their toys than let someone else play with them.\u201dThose men tend to come from chaotic upbringings and had poor relationships with their parents as kids. Unlike killers who murder for pleasure, Ennis said if you were to measure the heart rate of a man involved in intimate partner violence, it wouldn\u2019t be relatively stable.\u201cThey\u2019re not in a state of great arousal when those things happen,\u201d he said.In contrast, what defines serial killers is that they kill for the sake of killing, with a cooling-off period in between each murder. They are often driven by sexual deviance and violent sexual fantasies, which ultimately turn into acts of violence and murder.\u201cIf we\u2019re talking about those individuals, the best studies out there will have maybe 175 of those guys in North America \u2026 so that\u2019s a pretty small pool to draw from if you\u2019re trying to understand those individuals,\u201d says Ennis, who was involved in the dangerous offender case for Thomas Svekla, an Edmonton man convicted of murdering a sex worker in 2008, but who was suspected of having more victims.\u201cBecause that\u2019s such a relatively rare bird, we don\u2019t know a lot about (them).\u201dBut Venne, who has dedicated years of her life to addressing systemic violence against Indigenous women is hoping to help change that \u2013 and to learn more about serial killers and intimate-partner killers.\u201cWe have the opportunity to turn things around and get good research done so we could take the next steps to prevent these killings,\u201d Venne said after attending the meeting with Correctional Service Canada commissioner Anne Kelly in Laval, Que.\u201cPeople have been saying this for a long time, and I think we\u2019re at an important time in our history where we can really take a serious look at the factors faced by Indigenous women, but equally important is the research (into) how we stop the killers.\u201dAccording to Ennis, there was a time in Canada when federal institutions carried out in-depth assessment on incoming inmates. They assessed those convicted of murder to better understand what drives them to become killers.\u201cI had some recent experiences with federal Corrections that led me to believe that it\u2019s not happening very much (anymore),\u201d Ennis said.There is no clear reason why, but he said correctional facilities have moved toward a more \u201cassembly-line processing\u201d approach.\u201cI think (Correctional Service Canada), over the last 15 to 20 years, has gravitated away from rehabilitative emphasis towards a punishment and warehousing sort of angle,\u201d he said.But Ennis too sees value in interviewing killers, including on a personal one-on-one basis as well as with a more quantitative, academic approach.\u201cI don\u2019t know that is being addressed in a very in-depth or comprehensive fashion at this point \u2026 It hasn\u2019t fed into the larger literature,\u201d he said.There are two distinct conversations when it comes to men who kill women, and Ennis said much can be learned from comparing the two groups.\u201cYou\u2019ve got lots and lots of violent-towards-women men in this country, who have those similar characteristics,\u201d Ennis said. \u201cThey feel isolated, they have low self-esteem, they blame women for their problems \u2026 but why aren\u2019t they serial killers? What differentiates the guy who is more methodical and is killing for the sake of killing?\u201dThe ultimate goal for research into killers is prevention, and Ennis sees two sides to that coin. When it comes to serial killers, a better understanding of what drives them and how they commit their crimes could help women protect themselves \u2014 especially those at higher risk, such as sex workers or those who live a transient lifestyle \u2014 from becoming victims.For intimate-partner violence, research into the factors that lead men to kill their partners could prevent boys from growing up to be men who perpetrate that type of violence.\u201cIdeally, what you want is research that covers the entire spectrum, so you\u2019ve got that individual level of analysis, but you also have enough of those individuals so you can draw broader conclusions about them,\u201d Ennis said.Venne said she felt \u201cgood\u201d about her meeting with the Correctional Service Canada commissioner, and they seemed open to her suggestions. She plans to meet with the service again in the future, although no date is set.The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls is scheduled to release its final report April 30. Venne said a lack of information on what drives killers will leave a \u201cgaping hole\u201d in the inquiry.\u201cMy position was this vital information needs to be addressed. Perhaps it\u2019s too late for the inquiry, but it still can happen because there\u2019s still all sorts of injustices that affect the lives of Indigenous women, families, and boys and girls,\u201d she said.\u201cHopefully it\u2019s not too late,\u201d she added. \u201cThe inquiry is coming to a close, but I\u2019m convinced that killings aren\u2019t going to stop \u2026 The numbers have increased steadily. The numbers of women being murdered has increased. And it\u2019s shameful. Here we are in the greatest country in the world and we have this terrible black mark against us. And I think we\u2019re at a stage where we have to deal with this.\u201dOmar Mosleh is an Edmonton-based reporter covering inner-city issues, affordable housing and reconciliation.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl DyckCALGARY  \u2013  Vast geographic distances and high staff turnover have made it more difficult for justice officials to help Indigenous women and girls in the North, a national inquiry was told Monday.\nA week-long hearing of the missing and murdered Indigenous women inquiry began in Calgary with a look at the role of prosecution and victim services. The hearing is the first of two to delve into how systemic issues can contribute to the vulnerability of Indigenous women\nMental-health care and housing are scheduled to be discussed later in the week. A session on policing is to take place in Regina next month.\n\u201cThis is going to provide us with a foundation for our recommendations ultimately and our final report,\u201d inquiry chief commissioner Marion Buller said.\nLeanne Gardiner with the Northwest Territories Justice Department told the hearing the biggest challenge is building trust with victims and their families. When there is only one victims services provider in a community, staff turnover can be disruptive.\n\u201cAt some points, it has to start from scratch,\u201d she said.\nSome people in remote areas have no way to quickly get face-to-face services, Gardiner said.\n\u201cThe reality is that we don\u2019t have victims services providers in every single community, in person ready to support someone. And crime and victimization happens in every single community.\u201d\nThe Northwest Territories has 11 victims services providers who work through eight community organizations. Gardiner said those providers have been creative helping people by phone or teleconference, but she said that in person interaction is always preferable.\nPoor weather and spotty Internet connections can also pose a challenge, she added.\n\u201cAs northerners are apt to do, you adjust to the circumstances that you\u2019re in.\u201d\nJohn Phelps, Yukon\u2019s chief federal prosecutor, said his office deals with a hefty caseload.\n\u201cWe deal with a significant percentage of violent and sexualized violent crime within the territories compared to the national averages,\u201d he said.\nCrown witness co-ordinators have made things run more smoothly by helping victims navigate the justice system and by acting as a liaison with lawyers and judges, Phelps said.\nBut not enough co-ordinators are Indigenous, given how many people from those communities are victims of crime, he said. All of the Crown witness co-ordinators in Nunavut are Indigenous, but in the Northwest Territories only one of seven is. In Yukon, it\u2019s one of five.\nKeeping in contact with victims has also been a challenge.\n\u201cEither we don\u2019t have adequate information coming from the investigative agency or, because of the lapse in time, victims have moved on.\u201d\nNorthern prosecution offices also have a tough time recruiting and retaining staff, he added.\nThe inquiry has already heard from 1,200 people across the country whose loved ones have been killed or have disappeared.\n\u201cFamilies and survivors have told us about a lack of information coming from service providers and families have also told us about lack of timely response,\u201d said Buller, who added that a lack of cultural understanding is also a problem.\n\u201cFamilies and survivors have told us time and time again that there weren\u2019t translators available, that elders weren\u2019t consulted, that there was also a lack of understanding that in some communities women certainly cannot talk about domestic violence, for example.\u201d\nShare this story:21\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n\n Facebook\n Twitter\n YouTube\n\n\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nSubscription Services\nArchive\n \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nThe Lethbridge Herald\nOther Publications\nFood For Thought\n Contact\nCareers\n \n\n\nContact the Lethbridge Herald\n\n504 - 7th Street South\n\t\t\t\t\tLethbridge, AB T1J 3Z7\n[P] (403) 328-4411\n[F] (403)328-4536\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrint Advertising: (403) 328-4410\n\t\t\t\t\tNational Advertising: (403) 380-7585\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Advertising: (403) 380-7585\n\t\t\t\t\tClassifieds: (403) 328-4433\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2018 The Lethbridge Herald, A Division of Continental Newspapers Canada Ltd.\nAdvertising\nTerms and Conditions & Privacy Policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The government inquiry into murdered and missing indigenous women released earlier this week blamed the violence on long-standing racism, colonialism and sexism, along with apathy in Canadian society. It proposed more than 200 wide-ranging recommendations, from implementation of a national action plan and a human rights tribunal to establishing a guaranteed annual livable income for all Canadians. Implementation will involve not only the federal government but provincial, territorial and indigenous governments, said Marion Buller, chief commissioner of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. \u201cThey\u2019re all going to take work, commitment, courage and vision to implement,\u201d she said at Women Deliver, a gender-equality conference held this week in Vancouver. The 1,200-page report resulted from an inquiry launched by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government in 2016. Trudeau pledged this week to review the report and to develop and implement a plan to prevent future violence. Buller called the conclusion of genocide \u201cinescapable,\u201d citing generations of governments that deliberately underfunded education, health services and housing, removed children from their families and forced communities off their land. Sterilizations of women were done without their consent and at times without their knowledge, she said. \u201cThis genocide stemming from colonization, racism and misogyny is the reality of our past here in Canada, and it is still the reality of our present,\u201d she said. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police revealed in 2014 that 1,017 aboriginal women had been murdered between 1980 and 2012. The resulting inquiry into the missing and murdered women was a painful process that heard testimony from thousands of witnesses, including hundreds of family members of victims.

The letter is addressed to Chief Bernice Martial of Cold Lake First Nation in Alberta, who is also grand chief of Treaty 6.\nMartial had asked Paulson to verify the number, questioning whether the figure, earlier spoken of by Aboriginal Affairs Minister Bernard Valcourt, was accurate.\n\u201cThe consolidated data from the nearly 300 contributing police agencies has confirmed that 70 per cent of the offenders were of aboriginal origin, 25 per cent were non-aboriginal and five per cent were of unknown ethnicity,\u201d Paulson wrote.\n\u201cHowever, it is not the ethnicity of the offender that is relevant, but rather the relationship between the victim and offender that guides our focus with respect to prevention.\u201d\nHe said most female homicides, across all races, are linked to family and spousal violence. About 62 per cent of aboriginal women and 74 per cent of non-aboriginal women, are killed by a spouse, intimate relation or family member.\nThe RCMP don\u2019t typically release data related to race, said Paulson, because it can stigmatize vulnerable populations. He suggested it was fine to release what Valcourt already had.\nDawn Harvard, president of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, said she doesn\u2019t understand why Paulson released the figure.\n\u201cI feel like saying, \u2018So what?\u2019 How does that make it less of a concern? How does that make it less of a tragedy?\u201d\nWhile the released data may help point in a direction of needed community programs, there\u2019s still a need for a national inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women, Harvard said. \nThe RCMP issued a report in 2014 that put the total of missing and murdered aboriginal women at 1,181 (164 missing, 1,017 murdered) between 1980 and 2012.\nAlthough indigenous women make up four per cent of the Canadian population, the report found they accounted for 16 per cent of female homicides and 11 per cent of missing women.\nThe federal government has refused calls for an inquiry, saying it is more interested in taking action than studying the issue.\nEveryone \u2014 aboriginal men and governments included \u2014 need to take responsibility to combat violence, Bellegarde said. \nIt\u2019s a complicated issue linked to poverty, addiction, high incarceration rates and, in the end, abuse in residential schools that previous generations endured, Bellegarde said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not whole as a human being when you come out of that system, and then now you\u2019re trying to raise a family and trying to have a healthy relationship when you don\u2019t even know how to love,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe violence in our communities has become so normal and it\u2019s not normal. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to start breaking.\u201d\n\n\n\nNews Worth Sharing\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblog comments powered by Disqus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRecent Activity\n\n\n \nContests\n\nSaltscapesEnter contest \u2192Amnesia RockfestEnter contest \u2192Amnesia Rockfest 10e \u00e9ditionEnter contest \u2192Concours Mystic IndiaEnter contest \u2192Stars On IceEnter contest \u2192Concours Grande Braderie de Mode Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coiseEnter contest \u2192 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Ads\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nAbout\nContact\nCareers\n \n\n \n\nExtra\n \n\nTerms\nAdvertising Terms\nTerms and Conditions\nCommenting Guidelines\nPrivacy Code\n \n\n\n\ncalgary\nedmonton\nhalifax\nhamilton\nkitchener\nlondon\nottawa\nregina\nsaskatoon\ntoronto\nvancouver\nvictoria\nwindsor\nwinnipeg\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCopyright 2001-2015, Free Daily News Group Inc.\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow\n\nFollow \u201cMetro News\u201d\n\nGet every new post delivered to your Inbox.\n\nJoin 3,500 other followers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild a website with WordPress.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Before Tuesday\u2019s budget was released, Inuit Tapiriit\nKanatami- a national organization representing Inuit communities- had requested about $131 million over seven years for this issue.\nThe federal government also promised to spend $2.5 million to advance an action plan on implementing the 2019 recommendations of the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls, fulfilling one of its reconciliation-related promises to the federal New Democrats under its supply and confidence arrangement.\n\u00a0\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published March 28, 2023.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

My client feels his rights to a fair defence have been trampled,\u201d Cormier\u2019s lawyer, Tony Kavanagh, said in an email to CTV News.According to Manitoba Justice policy, a preliminary hearing should be held and direct indictment should only be considered when \"exceptional circumstances exist that outweigh the benefits of holding a preliminary inquiry.\"Tina was in the care of Child and Family Services, but police said she became an exploited youth in the Manitoba capital. Police have said she met Cormier at a residence they both frequented.Court documents allege Tina was killed around Aug. 10, 2014 \u2014 10 days after she was first reported missing from foster care. Police picked her up two days before it's believed she was killed, but did not take her into custody.Tina's family has said she was found a few hours later, passed out in a downtown alley, and taken to hospital. She was picked up by social workers and placed in a downtown hotel, but ran away again shortly before she was killed.(CTV Winnipeg)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2017 Prince George Citizen\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail to a Friend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Email Address: *\n\n\nYour Name: *\n\n\nTo Email Address: *\n\n\nMessage: *\n\n\n\n* Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext\nLack of snow wipes out biathlon event\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up For Our e-Newsletter!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCity Matters\n\nYour City Matters - City of Prince George\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Citizen\n\n\n\nYou Might Like\nMost Read\nMost Recent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWarrant issued for man wanted on attempted murder charge\n\nFebruary 21, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMan reported missing\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWandering toddler returned to home\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nOn-the-loose parolees arrested\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCity, NDIT resolve funding spat\n\nFebruary 21, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nArrest warrant issued; police ask for public's help\n\nFebruary 21, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCourt rejects challenge from man convicted of promoting hatred\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nStabbing suspect flees scene\n\nFebruary 21, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDowntown health services under review\n\nFebruary 21, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAnti-bullying event planned today\n\nFebruary 21, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLack of snow wipes out biathlon event\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCouncil rejects trucker's latest move in spat with city\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDevelopment projects advanced to public hearing stage\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNew purchasing policy gains city council support\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMan reported missing\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWandering toddler returned to home\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nScientists discover 7 'Earthlike' planets orbiting a nearby star\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nLack of snow wipes out biathlon event\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRebels edge Cats in shootout\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCourt rejects challenge from man convicted of promoting hatred\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump Presidency POLL\nBookmakers around the world are taking bets on how long it will be before U.S. President Donald Trump will resign or be impeached.

Initially, the RCMP refused to confirm the statistic, citing a \u201cbias-free policing policy\u201d that prevented it from releasing any data on ethnicity of offenders.\nHowever, in his letter to Martial sent April 7, Paulson says Valcourt was correct about the 70 per cent, but also said discussing the ethnic origin of offenders is counterproductive and damaging.\n\u201cPublic discourse on the ethnicity of the offender has the potential to stigmatize and marginalize vulnerable populations,\u201d Paulson wrote.\nThe data comes from a May 2014 report from the RCMP on missing and murdered aboriginal women which documented 1,181 cases in Canada between 1980 and 2012. \nPaulson said consolidated information from almost 300 police agencies that contributed to the report does show 70 per cent of offenders were aboriginal, 25 per cent were non-aboriginal and the remaining five per cent were of unknown ethnicity.\nHowever, Paulson said  that\u2019s not the statistic the RCMP want to focus on.\n\u201cIt is not the ethnicity of the offender that is relevant, but rather the relationship between victim and offender that guides our focus with respect to prevention,\u201d he wrote.\nThe data show aboriginal women were killed by a spouse, family member or intimate relation in 62 per cent of the cases compared to 74 per cent for non-aboriginal women.\nAshton said the government is trying to use the data to wash its hands of the problem and punt it back to First Nations to solve on their own.\n\u201cThey are trying to remove any responsibility they have for actively marginalizing aboriginal women and men,\u201d she said.\nBut Ashton said she also would like Paulson to explain if he was bending to the government in choosing to release the numbers.\n\u201cWhy did they choose to go against their policy?\u201d she asked.\nAshton wondered if the government pressured the RCMP to produce the statistic since Valcourt was facing political pressure \u2014 including calls for his resignation.\nThe RCMP did not respond to a request for an interview Friday.\nValcourt\u2019s office directed questions to Status of Women Minister Kellie Leitch, who said in an emailed statement from her spokesman that everyone has a role to play to solve the problem and listed initiatives of the government, including an action plan to address violence against aboriginal women.\nAssembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde demanded the RCMP and Valcourt release all information they have to First Nations.\n\u201cThat the minister of aboriginal affairs is withholding important information and, worse, is using it against First Nations defies logic and the department\u2019s fiduciary duty,\u201d he said in a release. \u201cBlaming the victim is no longer an option. The federal government must recognize the root causes of poverty and work with us to address the poor conditions and lack of supports that our people endure every day, including action to support men\u2019s healing programs.\u201d\n\u00bb\u2008Winnipeg Free Press\nRepublished from the Brandon Sun print edition April 11, 2015 \n \n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\nE\u2013mail\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Error\n\n\n\n\nRate this \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article has not yet been rated.\n\n\nWe want you to tell us what you think of our articles.

Monday, Jan. 12, 2015 regarding a investigation regarding the root causes of violence against Indigenous women in Canada.Photograph by: Jonathan Hayward\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, THE CANADIAN PRESSOTTAWA \u2014 The Canadian and B.C. governments are obliged under international law to take into account \"social and economic factors\" as they seek ways to protect Aboriginal women and girls from the disproportionate level of violence they endure, the Organization of American States said in a report Monday.The report from the OAS's Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, while focusing on B.C.'s grim status as the province with the highest number of missing and murdered women, called on Prime Minister Stephen Harper to launch a national \"action plan\" or full-scale inquiry into the problem.It also urged the provincial government to \"immediately provide a safe public transportation option\" along Highway 16, the so-called \"Highway of Tears\" between Prince George and Prince Rupert.While the report commended both governments for recognizing the seriousness of the problem and taking some steps, it delivered a rebuke of Harper's position that the murders are crimes and not part of a \"sociological phenomenon.\"\"Canada is obligated under international human rights law to prevent the violence by taking measures to deal with poverty, access to housing and employment, and disproportionate criminalization,\" stated a summary of the report.A \"national co-ordinated response\" must address \"social and economic factors\" that lead to higher risk of violence. \"This is big news,\" said Shelagh Day of Vancouver, who was awarded the Order of Canada last year for her work as an expert on human rights law.\"All governments in Canada have mainly considered that their responsibility was to improve police response,\" said Day, now with the Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action, one of the organizations that pushed the commission to launch the study.\"But the commission is telling them that they must address the root causes of the violence, and must provide a co-ordinated national response to the social and economic marginalization of indigenous women, including combating their poverty, improving education and employment, guaranteeing adequate housing and addressing over-criminalization.\"The Harper government responded Monday that it is already taking steps to deal with the problem, and that more studies and inquiries aren't necessary.\"Our Government takes the issue of crimes against Aboriginal women and girls very seriously. Now is the time for action and not for further studies,\" declared a statement from the office of Dr. Kellie Leitch, minister responsible for the status of women.Harper has maintained that position for years, and last summer referred to the murder of Manitoba teen Tina Fontaine as a crime and not a \"sociological phenomenon.\"The report, titled Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in British Columbia, prompted government critics to accuse the federal government of not taking the problem seriously.\"The Conservatives need to accept that this violence is systemic and we need to deal with the underlying causes,\" said B.C. Liberal Party MP Joyce Murray.Dr. Carolyn Bennett, the Liberal Aboriginal affairs critic, said the report has turned a \"national disgrace\" into an \"international embarrassment.\"The Assembly of First Nations noted that the report comes in advance of a national gathering of provincial, territorial and Aboriginal leaders next month in Ottawa to discuss the issue.\"The IACHR has concluded that the response of governments in Canada to date to this national crisis amounts to a violation of the right to life for indigenous women and girls,\" said AFN National Chief Perry Bellegarde, who called on Ottawa to launch both an inquiry and an action plan.The report noted that B.C., with 160 cases of murdered and missing women, had the highest number of victims of any province in Canada, according to a tally of the 582 cases across Canada from the mid-1970s to 2008, conducted by the Native Women's Association of Canada.A subsequent 2014 RCMP report said there have been 1,181 cases of murdered or missing Indigenous women dating back to 1952, of which 225 cases remain unsolved.The Harper government cited on Monday measures to toughen sentences for murder and sexual assault, and other efforts such as \"investing in shelters and continuing to improve Canada's law enforcement and justice system.\"The B.C. government, meanwhile, responded by sending The Sun a December news release from Justice Minister Suzanne Anton that outlined the various steps Victoria has taken in response to Wally Oppal's 2012 report into missing women.That statement highlighted legislation to help police find missing women, and cited compensation for children of victims and funding for outreach programs for sex trade workers and \"cultural competency training\" for B.C. police officers.On Highway 16, the government noted the expansion of cellphone service along parts of the route, $4.5 million to improve \"transportation options,\" and a $75,000 grant to First Nations in the Prince George area to improve local bus service.But the commission report Monday said the Oppal report and the government's steps thus far should only be considered a \"starting point\" toward more sweeping measures to deal with the problem.The report said police have failed to protect women and girls from \"killings, disappearances and extreme forms of violence,\" haven't properly investigated the crimes, and have treated the family members of victims dismissively.\"This situation in turn has perpetuated the violence, as the failure to ensure that there are consequences for these crimes has given rise to both real and perceived impunity.\"The commission launched the study in 2012 following a request from the Native Women's Association of Canada, the Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action, and the University of Miami Human Rights Clinic.Commission members met with dozens of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians, including Aboriginal Affairs Minister Bernard Valcourt and B.C. Justice Minister Anton.===Click here to report a typo or visit vancouversun.com/typo.Is there more to this story?

We hope information in the OPP report generates further discussion, potential leads, and/or resolution for the families and communities who have suffered loss.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Commissioner J.V.N. (Vince) HAWKES, Ontario Provincial Police\n\u201cThe release of this report is timely to the start of the\u00a0Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls\u00a0(MMIWG) National Inquiry and the release of the full report from the Truth and Reconciliation process. Now it\u2019s time to get work done based on a new social lens in Canada. Reconciliation means that all Canadians, all organizations, all political stripes and authorities, roll up their sleeves and begin to change a Nation. The Ontario Provincial Police report on missing and murdered First Nation citizens gives us a good starting point.\u201d \u2014\u00a0Chief Isadore DAY, Ontario Regional Chief, Assembly of First Nations\nDID YOU KNOW\nPolicing responsibility in Ontario is shared by the OPP, 52 municipal and/or regional police services, and nine (9) self-directed First Nation police services. OPP jurisdiction includes geographic areas under direct OPP policing including 324 Ontario municipalities, some of which have transitioned with their records and files to the OPP in recent years, along with 38 First Nations communities the OPP polices directly or for which it administers policing. The 52 jurisdictions that are not policed by the OPP are independent or regional municipalities within the Province of Ontario that receive policing services under terms of the\u00a0Police Services Act. These are self-funded, stand-alone municipal or regional police services covering their respective geographic boundaries.\n\u00a0\n\n2015-12-16\nWawa-news\n\n\n\ntweet\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAbout Wawa-news \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Items\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nHappy 90th Birthday Olga Basiw \u0093Baba\u0094\nJanuary 17, 2013\n\n\nHSCDSB and CUPE Local 4148 Ratify Agreement\nJanuary 17, 2013\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWawa Pioneers \u2013 Gus & Hilma Aho\nJanuary 14, 2013\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSault OPP \u201cK-9\u201d Team Demonstrates Skills at MHS\nSeptember 22, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFuture of Bridges in Michipicoten River Village Unknown\nSeptember 12, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nORNGE Lands on Highway 17 near Montreal River\nSeptember 12, 2012\n\n\nService Canada Planning to Reduce Hours for Wawa Satellite Office\nSeptember 12, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDubreuilville Strongman 2012 (Video/Pictures)\nSeptember 11, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u201cNorthern Nationals\u201d \u2013 Day 2\nAugust 12, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nFire Destroys Pancake Point Maple Products\nJuly 21, 2012\n\n\n20th Spring Cleanup Over!\nMay 15, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDemandez le \u00e0 la sgdn \u2013 Pourquoi la SGDN plani\nMay 9, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPBD Part II \u2013 Giv\u2019r Giv\u2019r White River is Today;!\nMay 5, 2012\n\n\nChange \u2013 Legion Ladies Auxiliary Monthly Meeting\nMay 4, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPBD Part II \u2013 Giv\u2019r Giv\u2019r White River\nMay 1, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPat\u2019s Bottle Drive \u201cPBD 2012\u201d\nApril 30, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAsk the NWMO \u2013 The Multiple-Barrier System\nApril 25, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDemandez le \u00e0 la sgdn \u2013 Le syst\u00e8me \u00e0 barri\u00e8res multiples\nApril 25, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAsk the NWMO \u2013 Financial Surety\nApril 11, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDemandez le \u00e0 la sgdn \u2013 S\u00e9curit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re\nApril 11, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nArt, Music & Fishing \u2013 Silver Falls~Michipicoten River Village\nApril 2, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAsk the NWMO \u2013 Assessing Site Safety\nMarch 28, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDemandez le \u00e0 la sgdn \u2013 \u00c9valuation de la s\u00fbret\u00e9 d\u0092un site\nMarch 28, 2012\n\n\nHighway Closures \u2013 2:50 p.m. Update \u201cAll Highways Open\u201d\nMarch 27, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nColdness and Cruelty in Wawa\nMarch 26, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nArt, Music & Fishing \u2013 Michipicoten Lighthouse\nMarch 18, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAsk the NWMO \u2013 Aboriginal Engagement\nMarch 14, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nDemandez le \u00e0 la sgdn \u2013 Engagement des Autochtones\nMarch 14, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPink Shirt-Day at MHS\nMarch 12, 2012\n\n\nAre Your Online Auction and Shopping Trips Secure?\nMarch 8, 2012\n\n\nThank You \u2013 MRGC Family Day Fish Derby\nMarch 7, 2012\n\n\nFINAL DAY-LAST CHANCE TO GIVE US YOUR INPUT \u2013 OPP CONDUCTING USER SURVEY OF MEDIA PORTAL\nMarch 5, 2012\n\n\n\n\n \n\nHighway 17 \u2013 Wawa to Sault Ste.

Monday, Jan. 12, 2015 regarding a investigation regarding the root causes of violence against Indigenous women in Canada.Photograph by: Jonathan Hayward\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t, THE CANADIAN PRESSOTTAWA \u2014 The Canadian and B.C. governments are obliged under international law to take into account \"social and economic factors\" as they seek ways to protect Aboriginal women and girls from the disproportionate level of violence they endure, the Organization of American States said in a report Monday.The report from the OAS's Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, while focusing on B.C.'s grim status as the province with the highest number of missing and murdered women, called on Prime Minister Stephen Harper to launch a national \"action plan\" or full-scale inquiry into the problem.It also urged the provincial government to \"immediately provide a safe public transportation option\" along Highway 16, the so-called \"Highway of Tears\" between Prince George and Prince Rupert.While the report commended both governments for recognizing the seriousness of the problem and taking some steps, it delivered a rebuke of Harper's position that the murders are crimes and not part of a \"sociological phenomenon.\"\"Canada is obligated under international human rights law to prevent the violence by taking measures to deal with poverty, access to housing and employment, and disproportionate criminalization,\" stated a summary of the report.A \"national co-ordinated response\" must address \"social and economic factors\" that lead to higher risk of violence. \"This is big news,\" said Shelagh Day of Vancouver, who was awarded the Order of Canada last year for her work as an expert on human rights law.\"All governments in Canada have mainly considered that their responsibility was to improve police response,\" said Day, now with the Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action, one of the organizations that pushed the commission to launch the study.\"But the commission is telling them that they must address the root causes of the violence, and must provide a co-ordinated national response to the social and economic marginalization of indigenous women, including combating their poverty, improving education and employment, guaranteeing adequate housing and addressing over-criminalization.\"The Harper government responded Monday that it is already taking steps to deal with the problem, and that more studies and inquiries aren't necessary.\"Our Government takes the issue of crimes against Aboriginal women and girls very seriously. Now is the time for action and not for further studies,\" declared a statement from the office of Dr. Kellie Leitch, minister responsible for the status of women.Harper has maintained that position for years, and last summer referred to the murder of Manitoba teen Tina Fontaine as a crime and not a \"sociological phenomenon.\"The report, titled Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in British Columbia, prompted government critics to accuse the federal government of not taking the problem seriously.\"The Conservatives need to accept that this violence is systemic and we need to deal with the underlying causes,\" said B.C. Liberal Party MP Joyce Murray.Dr. Carolyn Bennett, the Liberal Aboriginal affairs critic, said the report has turned a \"national disgrace\" into an \"international embarrassment.\"The Assembly of First Nations noted that the report comes in advance of a national gathering of provincial, territorial and Aboriginal leaders next month in Ottawa to discuss the issue.\"The IACHR has concluded that the response of governments in Canada to date to this national crisis amounts to a violation of the right to life for indigenous women and girls,\" said AFN National Chief Perry Bellegarde, who called on Ottawa to launch both an inquiry and an action plan.The report noted that B.C., with 160 cases of murdered and missing women, had the highest number of victims of any province in Canada, according to a tally of the 582 cases across Canada from the mid-1970s to 2008, conducted by the Native Women's Association of Canada.A subsequent 2014 RCMP report said there have been 1,181 cases of murdered or missing Indigenous women dating back to 1952, of which 225 cases remain unsolved.The Harper government cited on Monday measures to toughen sentences for murder and sexual assault, and other efforts such as \"investing in shelters and continuing to improve Canada's law enforcement and justice system.\"The B.C. government, meanwhile, responded by sending The Sun a December news release from Justice Minister Suzanne Anton that outlined the various steps Victoria has taken in response to Wally Oppal's 2012 report into missing women.That statement highlighted legislation to help police find missing women, and cited compensation for children of victims and funding for outreach programs for sex trade workers and \"cultural competency training\" for B.C. police officers.On Highway 16, the government noted the expansion of cellphone service along parts of the route, $4.5 million to improve \"transportation options,\" and a $75,000 grant to First Nations in the Prince George area to improve local bus service.But the commission report Monday said the Oppal report and the government's steps thus far should only be considered a \"starting point\" toward more sweeping measures to deal with the problem.The report said police have failed to protect women and girls from \"killings, disappearances and extreme forms of violence,\" haven't properly investigated the crimes, and have treated the family members of victims dismissively.\"This situation in turn has perpetuated the violence, as the failure to ensure that there are consequences for these crimes has given rise to both real and perceived impunity.\"The commission launched the study in 2012 following a request from the Native Women's Association of Canada, the Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action, and the University of Miami Human Rights Clinic.Commission members met with dozens of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians, including Aboriginal Affairs Minister Bernard Valcourt and B.C. Justice Minister Anton.===Click here to report a typo or visit vancouversun.com/typo.Is there more to this story?

Myrna explained her aunt lived a quiet life with her pets in a \"very safe community\". The LaPlante family did an extensive search that year and then continued each following summer and fall.Photo of Emily Osmond LaPlante\"It was disbelief, how could she be missing?\" Myrna asked.Emily's disappearance will be echoed in discussions about nearly 1,200 aboriginal women who have been murdered or gone missing in the last 30 years during the national roundtable in Ottawa. Several premiers and aboriginal leaders are meeting with Aboriginal Affairs Minister Bernard Valcourt and Status of Women Minister Kellie Leitch on Friday to try to determine what can be done. The gathering shows a changing national climate towards the issue, Myrna said.\"Going into our eighth year of searching for her and we still do not have resolution of what happened,\" Myrna said, adding it was difficult to find resources and support as a family left with so many questions.\"Now, the issue is out there. There is a huge Canadian response to this topic. Where as seven, eight years ago, I couldn't get anybody to respond.\"With hashtags through social media, art exhibits, walks, and vigils, Myrna said there is an overwhelming groundswell happening across the country to help raise awareness but there are still gaps in \"search and rescue, family support... and the basic things the family is struggling with.\" Myrna herself has become very involved with the Saskatoon advocacy group Women Walking Together.It's those types of issues, family support and searching resources, which Myrna hopes to see on the docket at the roundtable.\"I really hope they come back and say, 'Yeah we really want to talk to those families and we need to have a family gathering.' I am hoping that they realize the importance of the family voice,\" she said, adding an action plan is also important.\"I've heard different level of authorities say we are prepared to do action, I haven't seen what that action is that they prepare to implement.\"It's been just over two months since Douglas Hales was found guilty of the 2004 murder of student, wife, and mother, Daleen Bosse. Bosse's own mother Pauline Muskego said it was a very long wait for justice.\"We searched for her... our hopes would be up. Then when we didn't find her they would be back down again. It's like going through the grieving process, a never ending cycle,\" Muskego explained.\"Someone labelled it the cruelty of hope. You are hoping so much to find her and then you don't find her, and you are let down. It's hard, very, very hard.\"After her daughter went missing, Muskego helped to organize some of the first awareness walks in Saskatoon. Besides continuously searching for her daughter, Muskego said it was something she felt she could do.\"Raising awareness was one of the ways that the families got together to try to have a little bit of impact,\" she said.\"You can't just sit back. That was awful sitting back and doing nothing and just waiting and waiting for your loved one to come home.\"More than 10 years after her tragic journey began, Muskego said she can see that the waves of change have begun. Invited to the national roundtable but unable to make it, Muskego said she has trust in the aboriginal leadership and families that are in Ottawa.\"I'm trusting that the people there will do their best... If my daughter's story is not told that's okay because there are over 1,200 (women missing or murdered)... It's a step forward,\" she said.\"At least going forward is better than stepping backwards... It's unbelievable how aboriginal women are treated in this country... we have to be treated equally and seen in a positive light no matter what we are going through.\"Muskego said she would like to see a dedication of funds put towards areas of concern, including shelters, infrastructure, employment and education.\"The people that are in Ottawa right now, they are doing there best to try to come up with solutions about what to do in this whole situation,\" she said. \"The fact that it's at the national level tells me things are happening.\"There is also hope that the roundtable could be a step towards an national inquiry. The women are cautiously optimistic especially after a coalition that includes Amnesty International released a study Thursday saying the federal government ignored 700 recommendations from many studies on how to reduce the number of missing and murdered aboriginal women. That's a big problem for Myrna.\"The thing that annoys me is that a lot of the people that are there, at that table, have had no direct involvement with these topics that families deal with, that support groups deal with,\" she said. \"Lets see the results. What have we done? Have we gone to the communities?... Are our families safe out there? What do our families need?,\" Myrna asked pointing to things like education, employment and more family support.\"I want to see tangible things.\"Indigenous women make up 4.3 per cent of Canada's population, but account for 16 per cent of female homicides and 11.3 per cent of missing women.-with files from the Canadian Presskmalone@rawlco.comFollow on Twitter: @KellyGerMalone\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nPolitics\nCrime/Police\nMissing person\nCity of Saskatoon\nFirst Nations/Aboriginal\nSaskatchewan\n\n\nGive feedback on this story\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMyrna LaPlante sits at the desk where she got the news her aunt had gone missing.

This quality will serve her well in her newest role.At the age of 45, she has already served seven years as grand chief of northern Quebec\u2019s Atikamekw First Nation, and before that as a constitutional negotiator with the provincial and federal governments for her community, which is about 300 kilometres north of Montreal.Now she is settling into her post as president of Quebec\u2019s Conseil du Statut de la Femme, an arm\u2019s-length government agency that promotes and defends the rights of women in the province.The nomination is the first time that an aboriginal woman has been named to head an advisory body to the Quebec government. The timing was lost on no one \u2014 certainly not on Ottawa.\u201cIt was a nice surprise to be asked to fill a mandate like this in such an important post,\u201d she said in an interview with the Star. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a great opportunity to see a door opening to be able to bring my contribution and to be able to bring together our two nations.Article Continued BelowThere is a considerable gulf to bridge.About a year ago, the Quebec public was hit with a Radio-Canada documentary in which a number of aboriginal women in the remote Quebec mining town of Val d\u2019Or alleged they had been routinely harassed, intimidated and sexually abused by provincial police officers.The allegations reverberate to this day as Montreal police conduct an investigation into the provincial force. According to a recent report citing anonymous sources, there have been 75 police brutality complaints from both aboriginal men and women.The Quebec government has been criticized for not calling a provincial public inquiry into the matter, but decreed that it would instead offer full investigative powers to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women should its commissioners decide to delve into the issue in Quebec.The issue seems unlikely to escape the inquiry\u2019s radar, given that one of its commissioners, Mich\u00e8le Audette, is a former president of Quebec Native Women, a provincial advocacy group.Ottawa said the Val d\u2019Or investigation is a high priority for her in her official capacity. As an indigenous woman, she is not particularly surprised by the allegations.\u201cWe heard people talk about it, but as women we feel a bit disillusioned. We don\u2019t know where to turn to be able to express everything we\u2019re experiencing,\u201d she said.This is the perspective that Ottawa brings to one of the most valued and widely cited of Quebec\u2019s provincial advisory bodies \u2014 that of a segment of the population that is doubly discriminated against, based on sex as well as race.Less than two months into the job and just having scheduled her first round of introductory media interviews, Ottawa is finding that the heat of the spotlight is swooping closer.In the last week, Universit\u00e9 Laval in Quebec City and the province\u2019s Liberal government have come under fire for their hands-off reaction to reports of a series of sexual assaults that are alleged to have occurred in student residences.At an on-campus vigil this week to denounce the acts, one young woman rose to allege that she had been raped by a Liberal member of Quebec\u2019s National Assembly, resulting in the ousting of Montreal\u2019s Gerry Sklavounos \u2014 who maintains his innocence \u2014 from the governing party\u2019s caucus.The events have put sexual consent, gender inequality and the role of government onto the front pages in the province, and made Ottawa an instantly relevant figure, even if she is still busy mastering the various files and issues her office is working on.Ottawa issued a statement after the university sex assaults urging the province to launch a sexual assault and exploitation strategy backed with significant and stable funding. She has not commented on Sklavounos\u2019s resignation, which occurred after the interview with the Star had been completed.For the daughter of two teachers, one with a degree in sociology and in law, the solution to such troubling and often traumatic matters lies in education.It\u2019s a theme that carries over from her predecessor, Julie Miville-Dech\u00eane, who ended her term with a province-wide school tour teaching students about sexual consent and deputizing Quebec rapper Koriass and Marilyse Hamelin, a journalist and feminist blogger, to pass the message on to boys and girls before they begin having sex.Ottawa is also preparing to present the findings of a review of Quebec\u2019s educational material meant to ensure they contain appropriate and equal gender representations.Without scooping her report, she said: \u201cThere are problems and recommendations coming out of it. We see that there is work to do at that level.\u201dBut Ottawa says she welcomes the hard work and challenges ahead as well as the opportunities for to advance the lot of her people \u2014 both the women and the indigenous.\u201cIt comes with challenges, but that\u2019s okay,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a woman of challenges, a woman of action.\u201dRead more about: QuebecThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star & PartnersLOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a011\u00b0CloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsCharlie Sheen, a.k.a.

These grassroots movements patrol neighbourhoods and search the banks and waterways of the Red River in response to the many missing in their communities.\nThe RCMP has officially stated that about 1,017 Aboriginal women were killed between 1980 and 2012, and that another 164 were considered missing but the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC) puts the total number at 4,000. Either way, the problem is deeply violent and widespread.\n\"We felt there was so much more to the story,\" said Vermette, a Metis writer of fiction, poetry and children's books. Vermette made an NFB short with Erika McPherson called This River and the Instagram project extends it further.\n\"Our film was about the emotional reality of a loved one go missing and remain missing... [With this project] we wanted to highlight the work of so many volunteers who work tirelessly to do this work.\"\nVermette, whose new novel The Break is a finalist for the Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize and a finalist for the 2016 Governor General's Literary Award, is collaborating with local photographers Karen Asher, Mark Reimer and Janine Kropla.\nWhat Brings Us Here is an unfolding online project that finishes at the end of November and will encompass more than 80 images and stories. \n\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Mark Reimer\nOn the site, you get profiles such as Alison Cox, who says she's a volunteer because her mother was murdered and she gets \"re-traumatized\" whenever she hears news reports.\n\n\"I was becoming very depressed because of the number of traumas that were being retold in the newspapers, on TV, and I was starting to get really sick, very ashamed, very lost, feeling suicidal. These were all things that I went through as I was trying to learn about the story of my mother's murder.\"\n\nOr Aaron Stevens, who's recovering from addiction and feels the family atmosphere of the volunteer groups supports his sobriety:\n\n\"It helps me with a lot of guilt and shame -- you carry a lot of guilt and shame with addiction, right? I couldn't even look people in the eyes. And now I can be proud. Even when I'm not doing Bear Clan, I'm able to walk around with my head up high, knowing that I'm doing something about it.\"\n\nVermette says photographing these individuals is about \"awareness.\"\n\"It's about the amazing people behind the issue, the faces and the stories.\"\nProducer Smith says the reaction has been \"really positive\" from the people they've chronicled so far.\n\"People have been supportive and thankful,\" she said in an email. \"Their grace and generosity astounds me. In some cases, people have shared their story for the first time. The process is vulnerable and can be painful but it is also very moving.\"\nSmith also points to the fact the project is fostering engagement between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities, precipitating communication.\n\"I'm hoping we can continue this account in some fashion after November,\" she said. \"I think there are many opportunities for Indigenous voices and narratives on this platform.\"\nFor Vermette, the project has given back to her as well.\n\"I've really found a sense of hope. The resiliency and strength of my people inspires me.\"\nJune Chua is a Berlin-based journalist who regularly writes about the arts for rabble.ca.\nLike this article? rabble is reader-supported journalism. \n\n\n\n\n Print\n \n\n              Write to editor\n            \n\n \n\n              Support rabble\n            \n\n \n\n             Corrections\n            \n\n\n\n\n Tags: national film board gender-based violence digital technology Indigenous comunities Canadian arts murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls instagram\n\nRelated items\n\nrelated_item1State of Aboriginal schools laid bare in film 'Hi-Ho Mistahey!'related_item1_desc Filmmaker Alanis Obomsawin brings Shannen Koostachin's story to life with the NFB documentary Hi-Ho Mistahey!, which premieres at this year's Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nrelated_item2Mad Room: Black artist lays bare struggle with depression, anxietyrelated_item2_desc Tangled Art Gallery in Toronto is opening its first-ever installation, featuring the work of local artist Gloria Swain and focusing on her experience as a Black woman in the mental health system.\n\nrelated_item3Poetic documentary 'Koneline' brings B.C. mining into focusrelated_item3_desc Koneline  focuses on the \"golden triangle\" of land in northwest B.C. where copper and gold mining companies are busy drilling into prime territory where local people hunt and fish.\n\n\nComments\n\n        We welcome your comments! rabble.ca embraces a pro-human rights, pro-feminist, anti-racist, queer-positive, anti-imperialist and pro-labour stance, and encourages discussions which develop progressive thought.

As a family we were appalled when the RCMP spokesperson portrayed Roxanne as another Indian woman just out partying. This dismissed the urgency of the situation and very real concerns her family had for her safety,\u201d Hall said, in an interview.\n\u201cThese concerns were very well articulated to both RCMP and media.\u201d\nThe issue extends in a report released by the RCMP in 2014, the pressures on indiginous communities were highlighted.\nIt said that a total of 1,181 Indigenous women and girls have been murdered or are missing between 1980 and 2012. Of those, 1,017 are homicide victims.\nThere are 164 Indigenous women and girls are still missing and 225 cases are still unsolved.\nIndigenous women and girls make up 4.3 percent of the total female population but make up 11.3 percent of the murdered and missing.\nA National Inquiry into those deaths was launched\u00a0 Sept. 1, 2016. They are expected to submit an interim report in the fall of 2017 and a final report by the end of 2018.\nAccording to the inquiry\u2019s mandate, the commissioners will investigate the root causes of violence against indigenous women and girls. The commissioners are also open to hearing from indigenous men and boys who have relevant testimony, but there will be no forensic reviews of cases involving men and boys.\nThe event will be held at the Kelowna Courthouse, 1355 Water Street on Tuesday, February 14, 2017 at 5pm.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

Trudeau tells the House of Commons the Liberals will devise a new legislative framework to help pave the way toward stronger Indigenous rights and greater control over their own destiny for First Nations, Inuit and Metis people. Trudeau says it's important to get the framework right to ensure Indigenous Peoples can enjoy lasting success in Canada at last. He says the new approach, to be developed in partnership with Indigenous Peoples, is necessary to tackle challenges like overcrowded housing, unsafe drinking water and high suicide rates. The new framework will be unveiled later this year following consultations led by Carolyn Bennett, the minister for Crown-Indigenous relations, and Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\n\n\nSubscribers Log in below to continue reading, not a subscriber?

Patrick Brown stepped down from the role last month amid allegations of sexual misconduct made by two women in a CTV report. In late January, CTV reported that one woman, who is now 29, claimed she was still in high school and under the legal drinking age when Brown allegedly asked her to perform oral sex on him. Another woman said she was a university student working in Brown's constituency office when he sexually assaulted her at his home, CTV reported. Late Tuesday, CTV reported that the first accuser now said she had not been in high school or under the legal drinking age during the alleged incident. The woman said the altered timeline did not change the core of her allegations and noted she had been subject to demeaning and misogynistic comments online since the story broke. In a statement on Facebook on Wednesday, Brown urged the two unnamed women to contact police so the accusations can be dealt with through the legal system. CTV says it stands by its reporting, which has not been independently verified by The Canadian Press.NO PAROLE FOR 25 YEARS IN ALBERTA TRIPLE MURDER: An Alberta judge has ruled that two men found guilty of murdering three family members will not have to spend additional time in prison before they can apply for parole. Jason Klaus, who is 42, and 32-year-old Joshua Frank have instead been sentenced to life with no chance of parole for 25 years \u2014 which is automatic under the Criminal Code for first-degree murder. Justice Eric Macklin told court in Red Deer, Alta., that the factors in the case were not particularly uncommon compared with other murder cases and did not warrant consecutive sentences. The bodies of Klaus's father and sister were found in their burned-out farmhouse near Castor, Alta., in December 2013. His mother's body was never found but police believe she also died in the house. The Crown had argued that the two men deserved the maximum of 75 years without hope of parole for what the prosecution called a \"contract killing of sorts.'' The defence said the murders weren't as gruesome as other cases that resulted in consecutive parole ineligibilities. There are provisions in the Criminal Code to have sentences served one after the other for multiple murders, but Macklin said delaying parole for Klaus and Frank would be \"a decision out of the ordinary.\"TORY SENATORS BALK AT SPEEDING UP POT BILL: Conservative senators are balking at an attempt to speed up consideration of a bill to legalize recreational marijuana, which the Trudeau government hopes to have in place this July. Sen. Larry Smith, who leads the Conservative caucus in the Senate, insists his senators aren't being obstructionist but they are determined to do their duty, which is to provide \"constructive evaluation\" of legislation. The government's representative in the Senate, Sen. Peter Harder, says he wants second reading debate on C-45 wrapped up by March 1, after which it would go to committee before returning to the Senate for a final debate and vote. If the various Senate factions don't agree to that timetable, Harder says he'll move a motion to impose time allocation to cut off debate \u2014 a tactic he's avoided using before now. Smith says he's got 17 senators who want to speak during second reading on the complicated bill. He says he hopes Harder will agree to be \"flexible\" about the March 1 deadline.MISSING FIREFIGHTER FOUND IN CALIFORNIA HAS MEMORY LOSS, COPS SAY: A Toronto fire captain who was found at a California airport six days after vanishing from a New York state ski slope likely sustained some sort of head trauma along his puzzling journey across the country, American authorities said Wednesday. Constantinos (Danny) Filippidis was unable to provide officers with many details about his route from Lake Placid, N.Y., to the Sacramento, Calif., airport other than that he believed he travelled most of the way in a transport truck and was not the victim of any crime, the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department said a day after the firefighter was found. Filippidis, a 49-year-old captain with Toronto Fire Services, was on an annual ski trip with friends and colleagues when he disappeared from Whiteface Mountain.HEDLEY SAYS SEXUAL MISCONDUCT CLAIMS 'UNSUBSTANTIATED': The Junos have dropped Hedley from the televised awards bash as the rockers face allegations of sexual misconduct that they call \"unsubstantiated.\" Organizers of the annual music show say it was a joint decision with Hedley \"after careful consideration of the situation.\" The move by the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences came as band members issued a statement addressing claims of impropriety involving young fans. \"We realize the life of a touring band is an unconventional one,\" reads the statement, which was issued mid-afternoon Wednesday, minutes before the Junos announcement. \"While we are all now either married or have entered into committed, long-term relationships, there was a time, in the past, when we engaged in a lifestyle that incorporated certain rock 'n' roll cliches. However, there was always a line that we would never cross.\" The statement followed a flurry of claims on Twitter from anonymous users who alleged inappropriate encounters with the band. Some social media users called on the Juno Awards to drop Hedley as a performer at the upcoming show.UNDERCOVER TAPES PART OF TINA FONTAINE MURDER CASE: The man accused of killing Tina Fontaine told an undercover officer there are three rules in crime: deny, deny, deny. Raymond Cormier, who is 55, is on trial for second-degree murder in the death of the 15-year-old Indigenous girl whose body was found wrapped in a duvet filled with rocks in the Red River in August 2014. Court heard that Cormier was given a free apartment in Winnipeg and it had been bugged by police. The undercover officer moved into a suite on the same floor and became friends with Cormier over about six months. In recorded audio played in court, Cormier told the undercover officer he wanted to have sex with Tina the first time he met her. Cormier also said he regretted telling Tina to jump off a bridge when they got in a fight over her bike.DEAL WITH RACISM IN PRISONS, SENATORS URGED: The chairwoman of the Senate's human rights committee says Canada needs to deal with systemic, anti-black racism in its prisons and help inmates better integrate with society after they're released. Nova Scotia Sen. Wanda Thomas Bernard says the committee's hearings have shown a need for systemic and structural changes to prevent former prisoners from getting back into trouble with the law. As part of a special meeting to look at the experiences of black female inmates, the committee heard that pardons for past crimes would help some inmates find work. Black Canadians make up 8.6 per cent of the population of federal prisons, even though they account for just three per cent of the overall Canadian population. And while their numbers have declined, the corrections watchdog's most recent annual report found that black inmates were more likely to be in maximum security, placed in segregation and disproportionately involved in violent incidents.FEDS TO STUDY POT HABITS BY TESTING SEWAGE: The federal government is taking a somewhat noxious approach to studying just how much pot Canadians are consuming: researching our sewage. Statistics Canada will spend up to $600,000 a year for a contractor to regularly test waste water from 15 to 20 municipalities across the country for traces of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, and other drugs. The survey could be the best way to collect precise data on the amount of pot Canadians consume, according to Anthony Peluso, an assistant director at Statistics Canada. Peluso said that by using the same methodology from sewage analysis surveys in Europe that have proven accurate in the past, Statistics Canada believes it will be able to fill some of its information gap that way. After cannabis is metabolized by the body, traces of THC are left behind in human waste. Samples of waste water from sewage treatment plants can then be collected and tested for the substance.\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAdvertise With Us\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Error\nSubmit a Tip\nRefundRefund\n\n\n\nThe Brandon Sun is not accepting comments on this story.\nWhy aren't comments accepted on this story?

My client feels his rights to a fair defence have been trampled,\u201d Cormier\u2019s lawyer, Tony Kavanagh, said in an email to CTV News.\nAccording to Manitoba Justice policy, a preliminary hearing should be held and direct indictment should only be considered when \"exceptional circumstances exist that outweigh the benefits of holding a preliminary inquiry.\"\nTina\u00a0was in the care of Child and Family Services, but police said she became an exploited youth in the Manitoba capital. Police have said\u00a0she met Cormier at a residence they both frequented.\nCourt documents allege Tina was killed around Aug. 10, 2014 \u2014 10 days after she was first reported missing from foster care. Police picked her up two days before it's believed she was killed, but did not take her into custody.\nTina's family has said she was found a few hours later, passed out in a downtown alley, and taken to hospital. She was picked up by social workers and placed in a downtown hotel, but ran away again shortly before she was killed.\n(CTV Winnipeg)\n\u00a0\n\nThe Canadian Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n                                            Your comment has been submitted.

members speak at the opening day of Winnipeg hearings at the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls on Monday.\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWINNIPEG \u2014 Just one of the many cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women has left a Manitoba community divided, a family struggling with grief and a mistrust of the justice system, a national inquiry was told Tuesday.\n\n\n\nOn its second day of hearings in Winnipeg, the inquiry heard about the ripple effects from the killing of Roberta McIvor \u2014 a 32-year-old woman who was decapitated on the Sandy Bay Ojibwa reserve northwest of Winnipeg on July 30, 2011.\n\n\n\n\"It's really hard on me still. I still sometimes cry myself to sleep at night,'' McIvor's daughter Justine Strong said, sobbing occasionally as she spoke.\n\"I try my best to be the best mother \u2014 just like her \u2014 because I know everything I did with my life, she'd be really proud of me.''\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Clarke's Funeral Home\n            \n\n              Roberta McIvor was 32 years old when her body was found on the side of a road on Sandy Bay Ojibway First Nation.\n            \n\n\nStrong was 14 when she last saw her mother, who was going out for the evening to visit friends. McIvor's body was found the next morning \u2014 her head on one side of a road, her torso on the other.\n\n\n\nAuthorities told the family the decapitation was inadvertent and caused by a seatbelt during a violent carjacking. Two teenage girls from Sandy Bay pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were sentenced to two years in custody and one year of supervision in the community.\nFamily doubts police account\n\nThe family immediately had doubts about how accidental the decapitation was. It occurred on the third anniversary of the death of Tim McLean, a young carnival worker who was beheaded by a fellow passenger aboard a Greyhound bus on a Manitoba highway in a case that made international headlines.\nThe family also believed others in the community of 2,500 were involved in the killing, perhaps by helping out the killers before or after. Suspicion and rumours grew. The family did not know who to trust.\n\"My community was so split in half that people were hiding murderers within our community,'' the victim's cousin, Alaya McIvor, told the hearing.\n\"There are still a lot of unanswered questions.''\n\n#mmiwg family member Alaya McIvor wonders why all 4 commissioners aren't in Wpg?

Strong said she left Sandy Bay right after finishing high school.\n\"I don't feel protected in the community and ... it just doesn't feel like home any more.''\nThe inquiry also heard about the death of Cherisse Houle, 17, originally from the Ebb and Flow First Nation \u2014 an Aboriginal community 40 kilometres down the road from Sandy Bay. Her body was found in a creek bed just outside Winnipeg on July 1, 2009.\nHer death remains a mystery and no one has been charged.\nMy daughter didn't get to live her life.Barb Houle\n\"I know for a fact someone took my daughter to the outskirts and killed her,'' the teen's mother, Barb Houle, told the hearing.\n\"My daughter didn't get to live her life.''\nAs with the McIvor family, Houle's death had a ripple effect. Her mother recalled spiralling into depression and substance abuse. Cherisse's brother, Jordan, died in a shooting in Winnipeg three years later.\nCherisse's young son was left without a mother.\n\"The other day, I had him and ... he said, 'If I could have one wish, I wish I could see my real mom for one day,''' Barb Houle said.\n'You're failing us'\n\nThe Winnipeg hearings follow earlier meetings in Smithers, B.C., and Whitehorse, Yukon. The inquiry has faced criticism from some families about delays, poor communication, a lack of transportation and accommodation support. One commissioner and some staff members have resigned.\nAlaya McIvor told Tuesday's hearing she does not have faith in the process.\n\"You're failing us,'' McIvor said. \"This is not what family members picture as a national inquiry.''\nHer remarks were met with some applause from the audience.\n\nPreviously On HuffPost:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE:CrimeJusticemissing and murdered indigenous womenMMIWMMIW inquiryNationalNewsPoliticsRoberta McIvorSandy Bay Ojibway First NationSocialWinnipeg\nSuggest a correction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\n'This Is Troubling': NAFTA Tensions Erupt At Press Conference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGirl Dies After 325-Pound Cousin Sits On Her As Punishment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Known Unknowns In The Boyle Family Story Are Hard To Ignore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis One Simple Trick May Help With Constipation Relief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Due Date For The 3rd Royal Baby Has Been Revealed!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreed Hostage Explains Why He And His Wife Had Kids In Captivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE AND FOLLOW Politics \n\n\n\nGet top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.

(CP)          \n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe numbers are staggering and sickening. More than 1,181 killings and disappearances of aboriginal girls and women since 1980, according to RCMP. Of these, there are 225 unsolved cases.\n\n\tBetween 1980 and 2012, 16 per cent of all women killed in Canada were Indigenous, a shocking proportion when just four per cent of Canadian women are Indigenous.\n\n\tIt is against the numbing backdrop of this national disgrace that the federal government outlined this week the terms of a long overdue inquiry into the tragedy of missing and murdered Indigenous women.\n\n\tDenise Maloney Pictou, whose mother Anna Mae Pictou-Aquash, a Nova Scotia Mi\u2019kmaq, was killed in South Dakota in 1976 by members of the American Indian Movement, said the inquiry holds deep symbolical significance because it will at long last concede that the many, many lives lost truly matter.\n\n\tThe inquiry will get to work on Sept. 1 and is anticipated to run for a few months longer than two years at a price tag of $53.8 million, $13.8 million more than originally projected.\n\n\tThe announcement came 10 months after the Justin Trudeau Liberal government was sworn into office after their massive electoral win. Trudeau\u2019s predecessor, Conservative Stephen Harper, refused to hold a federal inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women.\n\n\tThe inquiry and its five commissioners have their work cut out for them in the essential quest to unearth systemic problems that fuel extreme violence against indigenous girls and women.\n\n\tThe commission is required to produce and deliver an interim report in a year and complete the hearings by Dec. 31, 2018.\n\n\tJustice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, a former B.C. regional chief for the Assembly of First Nations, told reporters that by looking for root causes, which include past and present systemic and institutional barriers, the inquiry will play a critical role in mapping a vital action plan to safeguard the human rights of indigenous girls and women.\n\n\t\u201cWe know that the inquiry cannot undo the injustices that Indigenous peoples have suffered over decades, but we can review what\u2019s happened in the past, reflect on our present circumstances, and chart a path moving forward,\u201d Wilson-Raybould said.\n\n\tWith the mandate comes great responsibility. This commission must come up with real recommendations for change needed to protect these girls and women.\n\n\tCanada will be watching. Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellengarde has said he will make it his job to ensure recommendations are carried out.\n\n\t\u201cIndigenous women and girls, their lives matter. It\u2019s a national tragedy, but it\u2019s an international shame.\u201d\n\n\tKamloops MP Cathy McLeod, the Conservative Party critic for indigenous affairs, says it is time to take steps that will make a real difference.\n\n\tWilson-Raybould said her government is \u201ccommitted to doing better and we will take action together to reach the goal of eliminating, as much as we can, violence against Indigenous women and girls.\u201d\n\n\tVulnerable girls and women need protection. This inquiry must find ways to ensure that happens. Its recommendations must be followed up by action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Report a Problem\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideos\nAll videos\n\n\nLatest\nEditor's picks\nMost viewed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutgoing No. 2 soldier blasts mi...\n\n\n\n\nKathleen Wynne on relaunch of se...\n\n\n\n\nWork starts on Stompin' Tom Conn...\n\n\n\n\nDiversity grows with proportiona...\n\n\n\n\nRaw Video: Melanie Joly takes in...\n\n\n\n\nRaw Video: Melanie Joly attends ...\n\n\n\n\nMoney Monitor: The costs of kind...\n\n\n\n\nXavier Dolan's new drama among C...\n\n\n\n\nReactions mixed to indigenous wo...\n\n\n\n\nNew funding to complement indige...\n\n\n\n\nP.E.I. man campaigning door-to-d...\n\n\n\n\nFirst Nations say Yukon salmon d...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRCMP revise death toll to four i...\n\n\n\n\nRaw: Sheep Flock Brings Car Chas...\n\n\n\n\nArmed Rancher: 'We Want All Peop...\n\n\n\n\nNew TVs Promise Sharper Color, B...\n\n\n\n\nSecond City improv class designe...\n\n\n\n\nIce castle opens in Edmonton\n\n\n\n\nRaw: Piglets Escape When Truck O...\n\n\n\n\nFor Santa Sightings, Tourists Fl...\n\n\n\n\nResearchers Use WiFi To See Thro...\n\n\n\n\nSpaceX Sucessfully Lands Spent R...\n\n\n\n\nAstronauts Fix Jammed Station du...\n\n\n\n\nNew Windshields Made From Smartp...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSailboat recovered from Northwes...\n\n\n\n\nIPSC_Shooting.mov\n\n\n\n\nMFRC, HMCS Shawinigan send schoo...\n\n\n\n\nB.C. couple walk free after entr...\n\n\n\n\nBen Affleck in Cheticamp\n\n\n\n\nNatal Day Fireworks\n\n\n\n\nP.K.

The World Health Organization maintains all types of asbestos can cause lung cancer, mesothelioma, cancer of the larynx and ovary, and asbestosis.\nThunderSky was also active in campaigning for a national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women.\nGobeil said her mother was too ill to fully comprehend the announcement earlier this month by the federal Liberal government that an inquiry will be held. But she said she was able to understand, and was happy, when a second-degree murder charge was announced in the death of 15-year-old Tina Fontaine, whose body was found wrapped in a bag in Winnipeg\u2019s Red River in 2014.\n\u201cEven if her activism brought closure to one family, that\u2019s one family that can rest easy and doesn\u2019t have to wonder forever,\u201d Gobeil said.\n\n\n\n\nWinnipeg, Manitoba\u2190 Connor Hellebuyck Earns First Career Shutout, Jets Blank Penguins 1-0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow @ChrisDca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\nManitoba Woman Who Wanted Inquiry into Asbestos-Tainted Insulation Dies\nConnor Hellebuyck Earns First Career Shutout, Jets Blank Penguins 1-0\nBrandon Man Threatens to Kill Woman, Tosses Her Down Stairs\nManitoba\u2019s First Openly Gay Politician Looks Back on Career, Struggle for Rights\nA View from Many Angles\nShoppers Line Up for Boxing Day Savings in Biggest Sales Event of the Year\nBlue Bombers Sign Left Tackle Stanley Bryant to Contract Extension\nPlenty of Winter Fun to Be Had in Winnipeg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweets by @ChrisDca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily News Updates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tHeadlines and breaking news delivered right to your inbox.\t\t\n\n\n\n\nEmail Address\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2015  ChrisD.ca - All Rights Reserved.\nFull RSS - Privacy Policy - Advertise - Contact - Media Services \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Manitoba Justice says the Crown will not appeal the acquittal of a man who was accused of killing 15-year-old Tina Fontaine. The Crown says in a statement that only errors in law can be appealed, and it has decided there weren't any.THE CANADIAN PRESS/ HO, Winnipeg Police Service MANDATORY CREDIT\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWINNIPEG \u2014 The Crown will not appeal the acquittal of a man who was accused of killing 15-year-old Tina Fontaine and dumping her body in a Winnipeg river.\nProsecutors said in a statement Tuesday that only errors in law can be appealed when someone is found not guilty.\n\n\n\n  article continues below\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\nHouse seller who failed to disclose killing loses $300,000 deposit\nLes Leyne: Richest B.C. speculators get biggest break\nIsland mother's fight results in missing-person DNA data bank\nWild teen party causes $20,000 damage at West Vancouver rental house\n\n\n\n\n\n\"After a critical review ... by the Manitoba Prosecution Service's appeal unit and the Crown attorneys who prosecuted the case, it has been determined there are no grounds to base a successful appeal.\"\nA jury found Raymond Cormier not guilty last month of second-degree murder in the Indigenous girl's death.\nHer body, wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down by rocks, was pulled from the Red River eight days after she disappeared in 2014.\nTina was raised by her great-aunt, Thelma Favel, on the Sagkeeng First Nation, 120 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg.\nFavel said the decision not to appeal made her feel as awful as the day they found the girl's body.\n\"It rips everything out of me, and I just fall every time I get some bad news, and then I have to struggle to try something new,\u201d Favel told CTV News.\n\"(It\u2019s like) they don't care, like she's a nobody, like she didn't even exist, like they don't even want to know the way she was killed. It hurts. It hurts so bad right now.\u201d\nFavel said she\u2019s been receiving supportive phone calls from family and community members and plans to speak with chiefs and lawyers in the coming days.\n\"Tina wouldn\u2019t give up and I\u2019m not going to either.\"\nGrand Chief Sheila North, who represents First Nations communities in northern Manitoba, said the lack of an appeal is just another example of how the justice system failed Tina Fontaine and her family.\n\"It just leaves another gaping hole in the hearts of ... Indigenous people,\" she said.\nChief Perry Bellegarde of the Assembly of First Nations spoke of the need to overhaul the legal system.\n\"We know for a fact that a young girl had her life brutally taken from her and a killer roams free. There is no justice here,\" he said. \n\"This is why we want a full review of the legal system, from policing right through to the courts, to create an approach that truly delivers justice for our people.\"\nIn February, a jury found Raymond Cormier not guilty of second-degree murder in connection with the death of Tina Fontaine, whose body was found on August 17, 2014. The death shocked the country and led to calls for justice and for a National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\nThe teen left to visit her mother in Winnipeg at the end of June 2014 and became an exploited youth in the months before she died.\nTina ran away repeatedly from a youth shelter and hotels in Winnipeg where she was placed.\nShe was last seen leaving a downtown hotel, where she told a private contract worker employed by child welfare that she was going to a shopping centre to meet friends.\nThe jury heard how Tina and her boyfriend met the much-older Cormier that summer. The jury heard Cormier gave the couple a place to stay and gave them drugs.\nWitnesses testified that Cormier had a duvet cover similar to the one Tina was wrapped in.\nCormier was also recorded on tape during a police undercover sting telling a woman that he would make a bet that Tina was killed because he had sex with her and then \"I found out she was 15 years old.''\nThere was no DNA evidence linking Cormier to the teen and doctors who were called to testify said they could not definitively say how she died.\nThe defence argued that the Crown couldn't prove that Tina didn't die from a drug overdose or naturally.\nDefence lawyer Anthony Kavanagh said Tuesday the acquittal was the right decision.\n\"The diverse and extremely representative jury did their job honourably,\" Kavanagh wrote in a text message.\n\"Simply put, evidence \u2014 not emotion \u2014 is required for a conviction and despite the human desire to find a convenient scapegoat, justice was done here.\"\nThe acquittal sparked rallies of protest and support for Tina's family in cities across the country.\n\u2014 with files from Kelly Malone and CTV Winnipeg\n\n\n\n\nRead Related

Indeed, a proper inquiry can not merely be an exercise in reiterating the acceptable maxims on aboriginal affairs, but rather, must take a critical, empirical look at the issues plaguing Canada\u2019s indigenous communities, with the goal of enacting measurable actions, for which both sides must be on board. Another $16 million will go toward the creation of family information liaison units.\n\u201cWe can not move forward until we face and recognise and put a stop to this ongoing tragedy. Until that time, our entire country will live under its shadow\u201d, said Patricia Hadju, Canada\u2019s minister of status of women. \u201cAnd just because \u2026 they\u2019ve been murdered doesn\u2019t mean that their legacy shouldn\u2019t continue, or that they didn\u2019t have a story\u201d.\nThe study \u2013 resisted by the Conservative government of former prime minister Stephen Harper \u2013 was a key Liberal campaign promise during the last federal election.\nOn February 26, 2016, at the National Roundtable on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, the federal, provincial and territorial governments agreed to participation and full cooperation in a National Inquiry.\nIt was an emotional moment for everyone: for THE families of missing loved ones, for the newly named commissioners tasked with overseeing the almost two-and-a-half-year investigation and for the staunch advocates who have, for years, been pushing for a comprehensive inquiry into why aboriginal women are so often the victims of violent crimes.\nBernadette Smith said families need all the help they can get.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard because, once again, we\u2019re not being heard by the government\u201d, Kudloo said August 3.\nKeira Smith-Tague of Vancouver Rape Relief and Women\u2019s Shelter said her organization is concerned about the absence of any explicit reference to how policing will be reviewed.\n\n\n\n\nSpecifically, we heard that policing and child welfare systems need to be examined. \u201cIt is that strength, the culture, the traditions and our languages that are going to assist in healing, that are going to chart the path to a future where Indigenous peoples can finally see their face in the mirror of our constitution\u201d, she said.\n\n                 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00ab Previous StoryStudy Dashes Millennials\u2019 Reputation as Hookup Generation \n\nNext Story \u00bbUnion calls on Allina hospital nurses to support open-ended strike\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n0 Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Comments Yet!\nYou can be first to comment this post!\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\n\n\n Click here to cancel reply. \nComment *Nickname *\nE-mail *\nWebsite\n\n\n Characters in the image above  *\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSearch for:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Advertisement\n\n\n\n NanoNews\n \n\n\n Latests News \n\n\n05/08/2016\n16:58\n\n\nRio set for \u2018coolest\u2019 Olympic opening ceremony\n\n\n\n\n05/08/2016\n16:58\n\n\nTrump expected to endorse Ryan, GOP sources say\n\n\n\n\n05/08/2016\n16:58\n\n\nFather arrested in deaths of twin girls found in hot car\n\n\n\n\n05/08/2016\n16:58\n\n\nSerbian Tennis Star Djokovic Favored For Olympic Gold Medal\n\n\n\n\n05/08/2016\n16:58\n\n\nNew Locally Transmitted Case of Zika Reported Outside Of Wynwood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\nAbout\nJoin us\nOur team\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms and Conditions\nSitemap\nContact us\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a9 2016 Copyright  NanoNews.org.

A solemn noon hour ceremony brought over 100 Yukoners in Whitehorse to remember the 14 women killed at Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal in 1989, and the 39 Missing and Murdered Women in Yukon.\nTuesday was the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women.\nBesides song, and prayer, Yukoners\u00a0held roses to remember the Montreal victims, the number of Yukon women killed, and those who experience violence each day.\nJoy O'Brien with the Yukon Aboriginal Women's Council stressed the importance of the inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, with many families still waiting for justice.\n\"They want you to know that these women, young women, young girls, were people just like you and me.

It helps them to know what they're feeling, to know that people care, and care to listen to their stories\"\nO'Brien says we need to change our attitude toward violence so our children can live in a violence-free world.\n\u00a0\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from Local News\n\n\n\n\n            26 mushers registered for the 2017 Yukon Quest\n        \n\n\n                Mushers from around the world have signed up for the 1,000 mile race but it won't be lacking in local talent. \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n            Cross Country Yukon looking for early snow\n        \n\n\n                Cross Country Yukon says it's looking to start fundraising for snow making equipment to allow competitors and hobbyists to hit the trails early. \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n            Yukon gets a new top mountie\n        \n\n\n                Scott Sheppard replaces longtime Chief Superintendent Peter Clark.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n            Busted pipe has city of Whitehorse seeking budget amendment\n        \n\n\n                City staff asking for $145,000 to fix sewage system.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n            Yukoners support Hospital Foundation\n        \n\n\n                Fundraising campaign for new machine at Whitehorse General Hospital well underway thanks to week long Festival of Trees.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n            Yukon Energy installs new safety alarm\n        \n\n\n                The Whitehorse dam is now equipped with a horn to warn people when the dam is set to spill, causing the Yukon river to rise. \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n            Whitehorse Huskies ask city council to support Coy Cup\n        \n\n\n                City council is being asked to provide funds to cover the costs of ice and the mezzanine for the upcoming Coy Cup hockey tournament. \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n            City of Whitehorse to consider fuel tank inspection bylaw\n        \n\n\n                City staff report to council some tanks that have not been inspected in Riverdale could leak and threaten the water supply.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n            Yukon Party hopes new Liberal government seeks carbon tax exemption\n        \n\n\n                Interim party leader says new premier should take that message to Ottawa during meetings with the Prime Minister this week.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n            Yukon Liberals sworn into office\n        \n\n\n                Saturday sees the remaining Liberal MLA's take the oath of office, and new premier Sandy Silver names a cabinet.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n            Unique initiative aimed at promoting road safety\n        \n\n\n                A Whitehorse company is looking to make sure that people don't drink and drive this holiday season. \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n            Yukon First Nations sign development agreement\n        \n\n\n                The territory's three most northern First Nations set direction for future development.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeather\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently Played\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Electric\n\nLife's What You Make It\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilson Phillips\n\nI Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPitbull/kesha\n\nTimber\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            Facebook\n                                        \n                                            Twitter\n                                        \n\n\nCKRW 96.1FM The Rush\n\n\nTweets by @ckrwtherush\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListener Club\nReceive exclusive content before anybody else!\n\n\nLog in\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacyPublic ProfileCompetition RulesTerms and ConditionsCookie Policy\n\n\n\nListen Live\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2015 RushFM & Aiir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs are criticizing how Winnipeg police investigated the death of a 22-year-old woman found unclothed in a train yard. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Mark TaylorWINNIPEG  \u2013  The family of an Indigenous woman found unclothed and injured in a train yard is criticizing how Winnipeg police investigated her death.\nPolice said Jaeda Vanderwal, 22, died from blunt force injury with hypothermia as a contributing factor after being struck by two trains on Jan. 5.\n\u201cI just want to know why and how she was there, found there, or how she ended up there,\u201d her mother, Natalie Beaulieu said as she wiped tears from her eyes during a news conference at the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs\u2019 office in Winnipeg on Thursday.\nThe family alleges there was evidence pointing to physical and sexual trauma and police moved too quickly when they decided her death was not criminal.\nConst. Jay Murray said officers conducted interviews, watched videos and used tracks in the snow to conclude that Vanderwal was alone in the rail yard and no criminal act was committed.\n\u201cHer death is a tragedy and we sympathize with the grief that her loved ones must feel at this time,\u201d Murray said.\nAt some point that evening, Vanderwal went to the entrance of the rail line, dropped some personal items in the snow and made her way through a locked gate, Murray said. She then walked around the area for awhile before she was struck by a train.\nMurray said it\u2019s believed she was suffering from paradoxical undressing linked to lethal hypothermia and removed her clothing. She began to crawl along the tracks before she was hit by another train.\nPolice were called to the area around 9 p.m. after train operators found her with serious injuries. She died in hospital.\nManitoba First Nations Police Service officers notified the family in Sandy Bay First Nation, which Murray said is standard protocol for people who live outside the city.\nNatalie Beaulieu and Vanderwal\u2019s grandmother, Linda Beaulieu, said they were not shown compassion when they learned of the death. Vanderwal\u2019s aunt, Elyssa McIvor, said they also were not given adequate information about what happened.\n\u201cJaeda deserved better treatment from the Winnipeg police. Instead from the beginning she was like many of our men and women who are thought of just as another Indigenous person who had substance abuse problems that led to their untimely deaths,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we are more than that, we are human beings.\u201d\nVanderwal, who was the mother of a two-year-old child, loved to laugh, her family said. Even when people were crying she would find a way to make them smile.\nVanderwal called her mother on the morning of her death and always stayed in contact, her family said. McIvor said it would be completely out of character for her to go wander in a train yard alone.\nThat\u2019s why the family said they were shocked when no one was contacted by investigators to talk about the hours prior to her death. McIvor said they\u2019ve also been given information from other people who knew Vanderwal which they believe could be important to an investigation.\nShe said when family reached out to police they were told to contact victim services or the medical examiner.\n\u201cIn the time of reconciliation, we Indigenous are no better off than when this word became a catchphrase,\u201d she said.\nMurray said the family contacted the victim service\u2019s unit. A meeting was arranged but the family didn\u2019t attend. He said any information that may show a crime was committed will be investigated.\nHe said police Chief Danny Smyth is to meet with the family on Friday.\nGrand Chief Arlen Dumas of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs said her death is reminiscent of Tina Fontaine, a 15-year-old Indigenous girl whose body was found in a river wrapped in a duvet cover weighed down by rocks in 2014.\nHe said it is important that police take the time to ensure that Vanderwal\u2019s family gets answers.\n\u201cI\u2019m very shocked and dismayed that Jaeda\u2019s life and memory is being treated the way that it is being treated and I\u2019m very disturbed that the family is not getting the support that they should receive.\u201d\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 16, 2020\nShare this story:23\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n\n Facebook\n Twitter\n YouTube\n\n\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nSubscription Services\nArchive\n \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nThe Lethbridge Herald\nOther Publications\nFood For Thought\n Contact\nCareers\n \n\n\nContact the Lethbridge Herald\n\n504 - 7th Street South\n\t\t\t\t\tLethbridge, AB T1J 3Z7\n[P] (403) 328-4411\n[F] (403)328-4536\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrint Advertising: (403) 328-4410\n\t\t\t\t\tNational Advertising: (403) 380-7585\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Advertising: (403) 380-7585\n\t\t\t\t\tClassifieds: (403) 328-4433\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2020 The Lethbridge Herald\nAdvertising\nTerms and Conditions & Privacy Policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Indigenous people.\"James Favel, who established the volunteer Bear Clan Patrol to keep an eye on inner-city streets following Tina's death, was not surprised by the decision.\"We don't even really have the expectation of justice anymore,\" he said. \"When these verdicts come down the way they do, it's really no surprise to anyone, and that's the problem.\"Tina was raised by her great-aunt, Thelma Favel, from the Sagkeeng First Nation, 120 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg. The teen left to visit her mother in Winnipeg at the end of June 2014 and became an exploited youth.Favel called Child and Family Services with concerns about Tina, who ran away repeatedly from a youth shelter and hotels where she was placed.She was last seen leaving a downtown hotel, where she told a private contract worker employed by child welfare that she was going to a shopping centre to meet friends.Over three weeks of testimony, the jury heard how Tina and her boyfriend met the much-older Cormier in the summer of 2014. The jury heard Cormier gave the couple a place to stay, gave Tina drugs and had sex with her.Witnesses remember Tina and Cormier fighting in the street over a stolen truck and Tina accusing him of selling her bike for drugs. Tina went so far as to report a stolen truck to police.Witnesses testified that Cormier had a duvet cover similar to the one Tina was wrapped in. Cormier was also recorded on tape during an undercover sting telling a woman that he would make a bet that Tina was killed because he had had sex with her and then \"I found out she was 15 years old.''There was no DNA evidence linking Cormier to the teen and doctors who were called to testify said they could not definitively say how she died.The defence argued that without DNA evidence and no cause of death, the Crown couldn't prove that Tina didn't die from a drug overdose or naturally in what Cormier's lawyer called the \"underbelly of the city.\"Defence lawyer Anthony Kavanagh said Tuesday the acquittal was the right decision.\"The diverse and extremely representative jury did their job honourably,\" Kavanagh wrote in a text message.\"Simply put, evidence \u2014 not emotion \u2014 is required for a conviction and despite the human desire to find a convenient scapegoat, justice was done here.\"The acquittal sparked rallies of protest and support for Tina's family in cities across the country.It came just weeks after another acquittal in a high-profile case in Saskatchewan. A jury found Gerald Stanley not guilty in the death of Colten Boushie, a 22-year-old Indigenous man who was shot in the head after he and some of his friend drove onto Stanley's farm.Stanley testified he thought the young people were stealing and he fired warning shots to scare them off. He said the shot that killed Boushie was an accident.Last week, the Crown in Saskatchewan also decided against an appeal, saying it could find no error in law.Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines\u00a0NewsletterSubscribeThe Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E\u00a01E6.

This is an issue of indigenous women\u2019s equality,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear that coming from them.\u201d\nHer fears are part of a broader concern among front-line workers and advocacy groups that they are\u00a0 being shut out of the process.\nBlaney said the consultations appear to be focused on families, and while it\u2019s important for them to have a voice, they\u2019re only one perspective.\n\u201cEach one has a unique story to tell and it\u2019s instructive in terms of the data and information that comes\u00a0 from those stories, and it can lead to healing of the families involved,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut my position is that the women in the Downtown Eastside and other urban centres across this country are estranged from families.\u201d\nBlaney\u2019s committee advocates year-round for women in the city\u2019s troubled Downtown Eastside and is one of several groups, including Vancouver Rape Relief and Women\u2019s Shelter, that have sent a letter to Bennett asking for a special meeting.\nRape Relief spokeswoman Hilla Kerner said approaching the inquiry using a feminist framework would mean examining the power relationships that have an impact on aboriginal women.\n\u201cAboriginal women are vulnerable to male violence first and foremost because they are women, then\u00a0 because they are aboriginal, and then because they are poor,\u201d she said. \u201cThe intersection between colonialism and sexism plays a crucial role.\u201d\nDawn Lavell-Harvard, president of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, is also calling on the government to hold separate meetings with front-line workers and grassroots groups.\nShe said she was told before the meetings started that they were for families only.\n\u201cWe absolutely understand and respect the need for the families to go first,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just want to make sure that there is an opportunity for those meetings with those people who do the work on the ground.\u201d\nSabrina Williams, a spokeswoman for the ministry, said front-line organizations are invited to the meetings, which are scheduled to end in Ottawa on Feb. 15.\nShe said participants have stressed the need for an inquiry to have an indigenous perspective and address the root causes of violence and the effects of residential schools.\nSome families have complained that the meetings are being rushed.\nWilliams said every effort was being made to ensure relatives have as much notice as possible to participate.\n\u201cWe are trying to find the balance between people who want us to get on with the inquiry but also the fact that we want to get it right,\u201d she said in a statement.\nCandice Stevenson, whose mother went missing 33 years ago, said she only had a week\u2019s notice before\nthe Vancouver meeting and she felt like she had to compete for a chance to talk.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s rushed, rushed, rushed. People don\u2019t get to really speak their minds,\u201d she said.\nBut she said the government shouldn\u2019t wait for the inquiry to take action on missing and murdered women, including increasing police resources to investigate cases.\n\u201cWe already know what\u2019s wrong. The violence against women, the systemic racism _ we already know those problems exist.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

A Winnipeg murder trial has been shown security camera footage of Tina Fontaine, a 15-year-old Indigenous girl whose body was found in the Red River in the summer of 2014. THE CANADIAN PRESS/ HO, Winnipeg Police Service MANDATORY CREDITWINNIPEG  \u2013  The man accused of killing an Indigenous teenager and dumping her body in the Red River told police he didn\u2019t do it, and urged them to search for a suspect who looked like the lead singer of rock group Led Zeppelin.\n\u201cDon\u2019t focus on me,\u201d Raymond Cormier told police during a 90-minute videotaped interview from Oct. 1, 2014, part of which was played in court Wednesday.\n\u201cWhat happened to Tina was wrong.\u201d\nCormier has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder in the death of Tina Fontaine, a petite 15-year-old girl whose body was found in the Red River, wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down by rocks, on Aug 17, 2014.\nShe had spent most of her life on the Sagkeeng First Nation and travelled to Winnipeg in late June of 2014 to reconnect with her birth mother. Court was told she became a sexually exploited youth.\nCormier, 55, said he met Tina several times that summer and sometimes provided her and her boyfriend a place to stay overnight.\nIn the video interview, Cormier told police he last saw Tina sometime in August after her boyfriend had left the city to return to a northern First Nations community.\nTina had come to a home where Cormier was staying with friends, he said, and got upset when Cormier took a bicycle she had and sold it for marijuana. The two argued outside, he said, and he followed Tina as she walked away down the street.\n\u201cShe\u2019s just yelling and screaming and I\u2019m yelling and screaming and \u2026 I got pissed off and threw her weed at her feet and  \u2013  gone, see you later,\u201d Cormier sajd in the video.\n\u201cAnd then I went back to (the house).\u201d\nCormier told the two officers interviewing him that there was a man walking in the same direction as Tina on the other side of the street, a little bit behind her.\nCormier told police they should seek the man out as a person of interest, and then gave a description  \u2013  a white skin, middle-aged man with shoulder-length dirty blonde hair who looked like a famous singer.\n\u201cRobert Plant,\u201d Cormier said.\n\u201cLed Zeppelin?,\u201d one of the officers asks.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nThe man had not said anything, Cormier added.\nCormier said he couldn\u2019t recall the date, but felt it was on a weekend just before Tina\u2019s body was found.\nCourt has already been told Tina\u2019s boyfriend flew to St. Theresa Point on Aug. 6  \u2013  a Wednesday two days before she was last seen by social workers.\nEarlier in the day, court heard from Sgt. Shauna Neufeld of the Winnipeg Police Service\u2019s missing person\u2019s unit. She said Child and Family Services got involved with Tina after her great aunt, who raised the girl in Sagkeeng, couldn\u2019t find her and asked for help.\nTina ran away from hotels and a youth shelter four times in the summer of 2014. The last time was on Aug. 8.\nTina had fallen asleep that morning in a parkade and was taken to hospital. The doctor who treated her said Tina had told paramedics she had taken the prescription drug Gabapentin, along with marijuana and alcohol.\nA urine test found evidence of amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine and alcohol. The doctor was concerned Tina might have been sexually exploited and offered a gynecological exam which Tina refused, she said.\nTina was released into the custody of social worker Kim Chute, who took her to a downtown hotel.\nOn the way, Chute said, Tina described having an older male friend who was going to give her a bicycle.\n\u201cShe said she was hanging out with a 62-year-old man named Sebastian who was a meth user,\u201d Chute testified.\nTina\u2019s boyfriend, Cody Mason, has testified Cormier went by the name Sebastian at the time.\nChute dropped off Tina at the hotel under the care of a private company employee who monitored Child and Family Services kids housed there.\nBut Tina immediately left for a nearby shopping centre, saying she wanted to meet up with friends.\n\u201cDid she tell you who those friends were?,\u201d Cormier\u2019s lawyer asked Chute under cross-examination.\n\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t,\u201d Chute replied.\nThe next day, Tina was reported missing. Eight days after that, Tina\u2019s body was found.\nShare this story:\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n\n Twitter\n Facebook\n Instagram\n YouTube\n Tumblr\n\n\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nArchive\n \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nThe Medicine Hat News\nOther Publications\n Contact\nCareers\n \n\n\nContact the Medicine Hat News\n\n3257 Dunmore Rd SE\n\t\t\t\t\tMedicine Hat, AB T1B 3R2\n[P] 403.527.1101\n[F] 403.528.5696\n\n\nContact\nCareers\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrint Advertising: 403.528.5659\n\t\t\t\t\tNational Advertising: 403.528.5766\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Advertising: 403.528.5698\n\t\t\t\t\tClassifieds: 403.526.7653\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2018 The Medicine Hat News, A Division of Continental Newspapers Canada Ltd.\nAdvertising\nTerms and Conditions & Privacy policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Indigenous organizations have been calling for an inquiry: Groups, including the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada and the Assembly of First Nations, have for years urged the federal government to open a national public inquiry into the phenomenon of missing and murdered indigenous women. They will closely examine the terms of reference and the commissioners selected. There are five people expected to sit on the body.In May 2014, the RCMP released a report documenting 1,181 murdered and missing women between 1980 and 2012. A year later, it said 32 aboriginal women had been murdered and 11 more disappeared since it first reported on the issue.2. The Liberal government plans to be flexible on timeline and funding: The federal government has banked on spending $40 million over the next two years on the inquiry but some observers already wonder if this will be enough money and time for the commissioners to do their work. Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett has noted this is a \u201cplaceholder\u201d budget and she has consistently stressed the need to get the inquiry right.Article Continued Below3. The previous government did not support an inquiry: Former prime minister Stephen Harper opposed a formal examination of the issue of murdered and missing indigenous women. He noted there were already a number of studies on the record and stressed the need for action.4. The commission will be able to compel witnesses to testify: Under the Inquiries Act, the commissioners will have the same powers as any court in a civil case to enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give evidence. They may also examine all papers, documents, vouchers, records and books belonging to a public office or institution.5. Child welfare is expected to be a central theme of the study: Bennett says child welfare will be a key issue. She said the government has repeatedly heard about the \u201cdevastating\u201d impact on children who are apprehended and what often happens to their mothers.The government is currently engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal over federal funding for child welfare services on reserves.In January, the tribunal ruled the federal government discriminated against First Nations children in its funding of child welfare services.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star & PartnersLOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a031\u00b0CloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto cops respond to gun call, find Terminator mannequinThe caller reported that she was taking out the trash behind her building when she located the suspect who she described as white, with a bloody face, standing at 6\u20192\u201d tall, in his 20s, and was wearing a black jacket.NewsGTACity HallQueen\u2019s ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion & StyleFood & WineHealth & WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReader's LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot Topics:MMIWRio OlympicsU.S. ElectionPokemon GoBlue JaysGeneration 9/11Panama PapersFresh Air FundWeather BlogFollow us:FacebookTwitterGoogle+InstagramRSSManage NewslettersSite MapAboutContact UsFeedbackthestar.comFeedbackSite MapNewslettersInsurance HotlineNew in HomesStar StoreCorrectionsBehavioural TargetingToday's NewsFlyersCanadaStaysContestsToronto Star Newspaper\u00a0Ltd.AboutAtkinson PrinciplesStatement of PrinciplesGet Home DeliveryMy SubscriptionContact UsContact WebmasterFAQNews ReleasesStar InternshipsCareers @ the StarStar AdvisersStar ePaperStar TouchAdvertise with UsAdvertising TermsMedia KitSpecial FeaturesInitiativesSanta Claus FundFresh Air FundSpeakers BureauClassroom ConnectionToronto Star ArchivesReport on Community Giving\u00a9 Copyright Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd. 1996 - 2016Privacy PolicyTerms and Conditions"

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward00000WHITEHORSE  \u2013  The chief commissioner of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls told the start of the hearings that all of Canada needs to hear the truth about the violence endured for generations.\nMarion Buller said the hearings are a sorrowful but essential part of Canada\u2019s national history.\nThirteen people, representing four families, are expected to publicly share their stories in Whitehorse, with testimony from survivors as well as victims\u2019 families continuing until Thursday.\nBuller says in the midst of recounting of loss there will be stories of courage and resilience, of healing, reconciliation, growth and innovation.\nShe says the commission needs to hear those stories so the country has a better understanding of systemic violence against indigenous women and girls.\nOther community meetings have been delayed until the fall, but Buller says the hearings are going ahead in Whitehorse because of the willingness of people in the city to participate.\n00000\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n\n Twitter\n Facebook\n Instagram\n YouTube\n Tumblr\n\n\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nArchive\n \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nThe Medicine Hat News\nOther Publications\n Contact\nCareers\n \n\n\nContact the Medicine Hat News\n\n3257 Dunmore Rd SE\n\t\t\t\t\tMedicine Hat, AB T1B 3R2\n[P] 403.527.1101\n[F] 403.528.5696\n\n\nContact\nCareers\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrint Advertising: 403.528.5659\n\t\t\t\t\tNational Advertising: 403.528.5766\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Advertising: 403.528.5698\n\t\t\t\t\tClassifieds: 403.526.7653\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2017 The Medicine Hat News, A Division of Continental Newspapers Canada Ltd.\nAdvertising\nTerms and Conditions & Privacy policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Justin Tang / THE CANADIAN PRESS \nPaul Martin had just rattled off an impassioned, combative speech before the Assembly of First Nations in July, and the audience members quickly rose to their feet.\nThe former prime minister hammered the Conservative government\u2019s funding caps on aboriginal education, calling the trend \u201ccontrary to every value Canada stands for.\u201d Martin\u2019s fiery keynote speech closed the AFN\u2019s annual general assembly \u2014 a three-day meeting that centred on a campaign to get indigenous people voting in this year\u2019s federal election.\nIt struck a chord with many of the national chiefs, who showered him with applause as he walked off the stage at Montreal\u2019s Place Bonaventure.\nBut there was at least one holdout in the crowd who refused to stand and cheer Martin: Joe Norton.\nIt didn\u2019t matter that Norton, the long-serving Kahnawake Mohawk chief, was an old friend of Martin, or that he agreed with the substance of his speech. Nor did it matter that the two leaders would embrace moments later, playfully slapping each other\u2019s arms in the middle of a packed ballroom.\nJoe Norton will not stand at attention for the former prime minister of Canada.\n\u201c(Martin) is a longtime friend of mine, we go way back and I have a lot of respect for him and what he\u2019s trying to do for First Nations,\u201d Norton told the Montreal Gazette. \u201cBut he\u2019s someone who represents something I cannot, in good conscience, participate in.\u201d\n\n Former prime minister Paul Martin addresses the Assembly of First Nations congress in July. Ryan Remiorz / THE CANADIAN PRESS\nThis is Norton\u2019s quiet act of protest against a government he says encroaches on indigenous sovereignty. It is Norton\u2019s way of declaring that the people of Kahnawake are not subject to the Crown. The gesture speaks to the basic political reality of the Mohawk Nation: even in an election campaign that could drastically alter the relationship between Canada and its First Peoples, the Mohawks say they will not vote.\nThough the Mohawks are bound to the Two Row Wampum \u2014 a centuries old treaty that affirms their nationhood and forbids them from participating in outside politics \u2014 they are hardly the only indigenous people who elect not to vote. Only 44 per cent of eligible voters on reserves across the country cast their ballots in the 2011 federal election. Meanwhile about 61 per cent of non-indigenous Canadians voted that year, according to Elections Canada.\nBut that could change.\nIndigenous people are the fastest-growing segment of the Canadian population, and community leaders believe that young, increasingly urban and politicized aboriginals will have their voices heard in Ottawa this year.\nThis summer, the AFN launched a campaign targeting 51 key ridings in which aboriginal ballots could swing the national vote against the ruling Conservative Party.\n ------------------------\n A powerful voice in 51 ridings\nAfter relations between the federal Conservatives and the Assembly of First Nations broke down last year, the lobby group launched a campaign targeting 51 key ridings in which the voices of aboriginal voters could help bring about a change in government. The AFN is just one of the organizations urging Canada\u2019s First Nations to participate in the Oct. 19 federal election.\nThe last meaningful attempt at cooperation between the aboriginal lobby group and Tories ended in 2014 with a proposed $1.9-billion education bill to fund on-reserve schooling. A few months after AFN National Chief Shawn Atleo and Prime Minister Stephen Harper struck the deal, it fell apart amid claims that First Nations consultation over the bill was limited and that funding fell way short of what\u2019s needed to give indigenous students the resources that the rest of Canadian children have. Atleo ultimately stepped down amid calls, from within the AFN, for him to resign over his handling of the file.\nNow, National Chief Perry Bellegarde \u2014 Atleo\u2019s replacement \u2014 says he\u2019ll do something he\u2019s never done before: vote in a federal election. Bellegarde is urging all First Nations peoples to do the same.\nFor non-indigenous Canadians, October will mark the nation\u2019s 42nd federal election, but that isn\u2019t the case for aboriginals. Before 1960 \u2014 when Prime Minister John Diefenbaker\u2019s government granted First Nations unconditional franchise \u2014 the only way an indigenous person could vote in federal elections was by giving up their treaty rights.\nThis fall will only be the 18th federal election in which First Nations people have the right to vote \u2014 and many consider it the first election to substantively address issues that affect the 1.4 million indigenous Canadians.\n ------------------------\nThere is another story that oddly mirrors the Paul Martin, Joe Norton anecdote.\nThis time, however, it was Justice Murray Sinclair standing at the lectern last June, presenting the Truth and Reconciliation Commission\u2019s final report to a room full of white politicians in Ottawa. Sinclair, who headed the commission, spoke of the harrowing abuse related to him by the survivors of Canada\u2019s residential schools, but added that he remains hopeful that the country can heal its colonialist wounds.\nThe Ojibway judge got his biggest ovation when he announced that the report calls for a public inquiry into the alarming frequency of missing and murdered aboriginal women. The crowd erupted in applause and Sinclair paused for a few moments to let the noise subside. There was, once again, at least one notable holdout: Bernard Valcourt, minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development.\nPerhaps more than any other moment over the last decade, Valcourt\u2019s decision to sit in protest speaks to the increasingly dysfunctional relationship between the governing Conservatives and First Nations. The Tories will not heed Sinclair\u2019s call for an inquiry and won\u2019t implement many of the other 93 recommendations of the TRC\u2019s report.\nThe Harper government has repeatedly dismissed the idea that Canada\u2019s missing and murdered indigenous women represent a sociological phenomenon, and it has held firm on this point in the face of unrelenting criticism from First Nations. All of Canada\u2019s other major political parties, including the premiers of its 10 provinces, oppose the Conservatives on this front.\nWith each passing story of a young indigenous woman\u2019s body found along the side of a river or in a pile of garbage, calls for the inquiry have grown and this, to many aboriginals, is the issue drawing them into the national debate. An inquiry will certainly not bring back the 1,213 aboriginal women who were killed or went missing over the last 25 years, but advocates say it would humanize the victims and force Canadians to confront some of the endemic problems First Nations face.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the need for an inquiry is one of the things that really pushed me to get involved,\u201d said Tanya Lalonde, who works with the Liberal Party\u2019s Aboriginal Peoples Commission, a political outreach group. \u201cYou hear about the way these women die and you want to know why it happens so often and you want it to stop. \u2026 You want politicians to hear the families of these women, to listen to these families and take action.\u201d\nLalonde\u2019s experience speaks to a possible shift in Canadian politics. Before she became the head of the Quebec branch of the APC in 2013, the position had been vacant for about 20 years. One former Liberal adviser said that courting the aboriginal vote was seen, by politicians of every stripe, as something of a fool\u2019s errand given that they represent such a low percentage of the electorate (and one that doesn\u2019t tend to vote in large numbers). But things seems different now.\nA lot of Lalonde\u2019s outreach work involves building bridges between her party and Montreal\u2019s growing aboriginal community.\n\u201cBefore getting involved (with the Liberals), I did some thinking and I decided that there needed to be someone at the table bringing an indigenous perspective,\u201d said Lalonde. \u201cA lot of the candidates care about the issues, but they don\u2019t necessarily know a lot about them. My job is to give them context.\u201d\nLike about 60 per cent of Canada\u2019s indigenous population, Lalonde does not live on a reserve. The 34-year-old hails from a remote M\u00e9tis settlement in Alberta, and came to Montreal to pursue a degree in social work at McGill University. Although the missing and murdered file is close to her heart, Lalonde\u2019s life story reveals a variety of issues that affect Canada\u2019s indigenous population.\nLalonde grew up poor, in a crowded house without running water, but she says there were happy moments in her childhood. She lived a sort of traditional life: her grandfather was a trapper, a hunter and fisherman and, in those days, Lalonde experienced a deep connection to the land and her culture.\n\u201cBut I also saw what poverty does to people \u2026 when I was a kid I was taken away, apprehended, and I spent the rest of my life in the child welfare system,\u201d Lalonde said. \u201cI lived in a series of foster families, they were loving families but they weren\u2019t indigenous families. So I lost that connection to who I was, and that\u2019s something a lot of children go through.\nblockquote - A lot of the research shows that the reason so many indigenous children are taken away isn\u2019t something like abuse \u2014 it\u2019s poverty that gets marked as neglect.\n\u201cI have a sister who is two years older than me who went through this with me. She got pregnant at a young age, she became addicted for a very long time. I was lucky, I got to reconnect to my culture when I was a teenager, I went to powwows and (sweat lodges) and met with elders and that saved me from going down another path.\u201d\nStudies suggest there are more aboriginal children removed from their families today than there were at the height of Canada\u2019s residential school program. In the TRC\u2019s final report, Sinclair referred to the trend as a continuation of the assimilationist policies of Canada\u2019s past.\n\u201cA lot of the research shows that the reason so many indigenous children are taken away isn\u2019t something like abuse \u2014 it\u2019s poverty that gets marked as neglect,\u201d Lalonde said. \u201cFamilies who don\u2019t have enough money to cover the basic necessities for their children, rather than get help from the system, they\u2019re punished by the system and their children are taken away.\u201d\nLalonde says her own experience shows that First Nations people can succeed inside the nation\u2019s political system instead of apart from it.\n ------------------------\nA few weeks ago, Wab Kinew waded across the Lake of the Woods shoreline in Northern Ontario, hand-picking wild rice from the brisk water.\nLater this fall, he will head into the bush to hunt water fowl with his two sons. Like many other Anishnaabe, Kinew fasts in the summer, partakes in the sun dance and sweat lodges, he speaks Ojibway and observes the rituals that keep his culture alive.\nKinew has been a hereditary Ojibway chief since he was 22, in a political sphere that \u2014 at least on the surface \u2014 feels miles away from the pomp and ceremony of Westminster-style democracy.\nBut come Oct. 19, none of this will stop Kinew from casting his ballot.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an argument that you\u2019re sacrificing some part of yourself, some part of your indigenous identity by participating in federal or municipal or provincial elections,\u201d says Kinew, a journalist, author and the University of Manitoba\u2019s director of indigenous inclusion. \u201cBut I disagree. I voted in every election since I turned 18. I voted in First Nations elections, civic elections, provincial elections and federal elections.\n\u201cAnd I noticed, along the way, I never spoke less Ojibway after I voted. I didn\u2019t feel any of my treaty rights or aboriginal rights impacted after I voted. I didn\u2019t feel as though the sovereignty of my community was, in any way, impeded. I don\u2019t buy that argument. \u2026 It\u2019s like, yes, I\u2019m status (Indian) but I also live in the city, my kids go to public school in Manitoba \u2014 so why wouldn\u2019t I participate in the election?\u201d\nWhile there\u2019s certainly a philosophical concern over elections and indigenous identity, one of the biggest roadblocks preventing aboriginals from getting to the polls is the actual voting process itself. It was once possible for aboriginals to vote using their Status Cards \u2014 a form of government-issued identification \u2014 but a federal bill passed in 2014 requires additional proof of identification and residence.\nWhile critics of the government say this was a tactic aimed at disenfranchising indigenous voters, it may have had an opposite effect.\nblockquote - We\u2019re seeing, in my region \u2026 communities that are doing the work of showing what you need to do to vote. That\u2019s certainly an unprecedented move, and we\u2019re seeing that in ridings across the country.\n\u201cIn my home community of Onigaming, you\u2019re seeing voter registration drives where people are going to the band office, getting their proof of residency straightened out so they\u2019ll be eligible to vote,\u201d said Kinew. \u201cI\u2019ve seen get-out-the-vote campaigns before, but never with this kind of a grassroots feel to it.\u201d\nMeanwhile, groups like Indigenous Rock the Vote have held a series of monthly voter identification clinics in Winnipeg and online to ensure that young aboriginal people are registered to vote in their ridings. The non-partisan group played a factor in Winnipeg\u2019s municipal election last year, when the city elected M\u00e9tis Mayor Brian Bowman, and also saw Cree candidate Robert Falcon Ouellette place third with 16 per cent of the vote.\n\u201cIn some of the isolated, fly-in communities in my riding, we\u2019ve got people calling us and saying, \u2018How do I get the vote out in Fort Albany or Kashechewan? I\u2019ve never done this, how do we do it?\u2019 \u201d said Charlie Angus, the NDP candidate in Ontario\u2019s Timmins\u2014James Bay riding. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing, in my region \u2026 communities that are doing the work of showing what you need to do to vote. That\u2019s certainly an unprecedented move, and we\u2019re seeing that in ridings across the country.\u201d\nSocial media is also playing a role in the campaign, according to Angus and Kinew. As with the 2012 Idle no More protest movement, young aboriginal people are bypassing traditional media and connecting with each other directly through Facebook and Twitter.\nStill, there are people who cannot reconcile their independence as First Nations with the act of voting for what they consider to be a foreign government occupying unceded indigenous territory.\nThe Two Row Wampum is an important reminder of this principle. The wampum belt treaty \u2014 which the Mohawks presented to Dutch settlers in the 17th century in what is now upstate New York \u2014 has two lines that run across it to symbolize both nations travelling side-by-side down the river of life.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t step into their boat and they don\u2019t set foot in ours,\u201d said Norton. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been allies, not subjects, of the colonialists. We fought alongside Canada, defended Canada against the United States in the War of 1812. And we\u2019re proud of our history.\u201d\n\u201cBut the Two Row Wampum was meant to go on forever. That\u2019s why, when you look at a replica of it, you see strings on the end of it so you can keep adding to the belt as years go by. So we don\u2019t vote, not now, not ever.\u201d\n ------------------------\nThe relationship between the Harper government and Canada\u2019s indigenous people hasn\u2019t always been fractured. The prime minister made the unprecedented gesture, in 2008, of apologizing on behalf of the government for its role in Canada\u2019s residential school system.\nDuring a ceremony at the House of Commons, Harper offered a heartfelt, eloquent apology, admitting that for years, the government\u2019s goal had been to forcefully remove aboriginal children from their homes and \u201ckill the Indian\u201d inside them. Harper even delivered part of the speech in Ojibway, Cree and Inuktitut.\n\u201cYou have been working on recovering from this experience for a long time and in a very real sense, we are now joining you on this journey,\u201d he said, before an audience of survivors.\nEven Angus, who rarely passes up an opportunity to criticize the Tory leader, calls Harper\u2019s apology a high moment in Canadian Parliamentary history. But to Kinew \u2014 whose father was beaten and sexually abused during his years in residential school \u2014 the beauty of that apology did not translate into meaningful action.\nThose who \u201cwho want to get on with the business of reconciliation,\u201d says Kinew, \u201chave been disappointed that, while the apology was made by this government and a lot of the rhetoric is what people want to hear, the actual policy proposals and funding priorities are not there.\u201d\nThe Montreal Gazette\u2019s emails to the Conservative government seeking comment for this article were not returned.\nSeven years after Harper vowed to accompany First Nations down the path of reconciliation, the gap between the quality of life on Canada\u2019s reserves and in its cities remains significant. On-reserve schools are underfunded, studies suggest 40 per cent of aboriginal children live in poverty and a recently-released Senate report found that the housing crisis afflicting reserves may be worse than previously thought \u2014 it could take the immediate construction of up to 85,000 houses, the report says, to accommodate Canada\u2019s surging aboriginal population.\nAnd so there may also be a natural skepticism about what any political party could do to improve the lot of a young, energized population that doesn\u2019t have access to the same resources as their non-indigenous counterparts. Many First Nations people will be poor and feel alienated from the mainstream Canadian experience when the polls open on Oct. 19, and they\u2019ll still be poor and marginalized after a new government is elected on Oct. 20.\nThere is still hope at a better future, says Kinew, but it has to start at the voting booth \u2014 and it won\u2019t happen overnight.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long-term investment in building political capital for our communities,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want action on the issues that face indigenous people. Well, part of the way you get action from politicians is you vote in sufficient numbers that they realize you vote; and then you talk to them during their time in office and during the election campaigns. Over time, as politicians realize the indigenous people are a significant electoral force, they\u2019ll meet with us and make pitches to us based on what they think will earn our votes.\u201d \n\nNews Archives\n\nYour source for aboriginal information.\n          Subscribe to our other publications as well.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Hiring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW Promotions and Marketing Executive, Sales and Marketing Executives (3), and Digital Sales Executive\n          Turtle Island News Multi Media Publishing Company\n          Ohsweken, ON \nApply NOW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetters to the Editor\n\n\n\n\n\nMERX Tender Information is available by clicking on the logo \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo unsubscribe from Turtle Island News communications, simply send an e-mail to: dailynews@theturtleislandnews.com with the phrase \"Unsubscribe from Turtle Island News Communications\" in the subject line of your email.\n\u00a9 Copyright 2015 Turtle Island News.

Court was told she became a sexually exploited youth.\nCormier, 55, said he met Tina several times that summer and sometimes provided her and her boyfriend a place to stay overnight.\nIn the video interview, Cormier told police he last saw Tina sometime in August after her boyfriend had left the city to return to a northern First Nations community.\nTina had come to a home where Cormier was staying with friends, he said, and got upset when Cormier took a bicycle she had and sold it for marijuana. The two argued outside, he said, and he followed Tina as she walked away down the street.\n\u201cShe\u2019s just yelling and screaming and I\u2019m yelling and screaming and \u2026 I got pissed off and threw her weed at her feet and, gone, see you later,\u201d Cormier said in the video.\n\u201cAnd then I went back to (the house).\u201d\nCormier told the two officers interviewing him that there was a man walking in the same direction as Tina on the other side of the street, a little bit behind her.\nCormier told police they should seek the man out as a person of interest, and then gave a description, a white skin, middle-aged man with shoulder-length dirty blonde hair who looked like a famous singer.\n\u201cRobert Plant,\u201d Cormier said.\n\u201cLed Zeppelin?,\u201d one of the officers asks.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nThe man had not said anything, Cormier added.\nCormier said he couldn\u2019t recall the date, but felt it was on a weekend just before Tina\u2019s body was found.\nCourt has already been told Tina\u2019s boyfriend flew to St. Theresa Point on Aug. 6, a Wednesday two days before she was last seen by social workers.\nEarlier in the day, court heard from Sgt. Shauna Neufeld of the Winnipeg Police Service\u2019s missing person\u2019s unit. She said Child and Family Services got involved with Tina after her great aunt, who raised the girl in Sagkeeng, couldn\u2019t find her and asked for help.\nTina ran away from hotels and a youth shelter four times in the summer of 2014. The last time was on Aug. 8.\nTina had fallen asleep that morning in a parkade and was taken to hospital. The doctor who treated her said Tina had told paramedics she had taken the prescription drug Gabapentin, along with marijuana and alcohol.\nA urine test found evidence of amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine and alcohol. The doctor was concerned Tina might have been sexually exploited and offered a gynecological exam which Tina refused, she said.\nTina was released into the custody of social worker Kim Chute, who took her to a downtown hotel.\nOn the way, Chute said, Tina described having an older male friend who was going to give her a bicycle.\n\u201cShe said she was hanging out with a 62-year-old man named Sebastian who was a meth user,\u201d Chute testified.\nTina\u2019s boyfriend, Cody Mason, has testified Cormier went by the name Sebastian at the time.\nChute dropped off Tina at the hotel under the care of a private company employee who monitored Child and Family Services kids housed there.\nBut Tina immediately left for a nearby shopping centre, saying she wanted to meet up with friends.\n\u201cDid she tell you who those friends were?,\u201d Cormier\u2019s lawyer asked Chute under cross-examination.\n\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t,\u201d Chute replied.\nThe next day, Tina was reported missing. Eight days after that, Tina\u2019s body was found.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

(AP) - One of the largest annual gatherings of indigenous people in the United States begins Friday in New Mexico, where organizers of the two-day powwow say they want to build awareness around the deaths and disappearances of Native American women.Melonie Mathews, whose family founded the Gathering of Nations Powwow, said organizers are dedicating the Miss Indian World Pageant to missing and murdered indigenous women. Their plight has become a focus in the past year of state and federal legislation, marches and demonstrations, and a series of stories by The Associated Press .A national awareness campaign will be promoted on a billboard near the powwow venue in Albuquerque. Several federal lawmakers - including one of the first Native American women elected to Congress, Rep. Deb Haaland of New Mexico - said in a statement Thursday that they are endorsing the campaign.\"We're just recognizing and trying to bring more of a call of action toward the issue itself,\" Mathews said. \"What we would like to do is plant the seeds with (pageant) contestants. We want them to create a dialogue with their communities. Hopefully it will be the beginning to the end of this problem.\"On some reservations, federal studies have shown Native American women are killed at more than 10 times the national average.The pageant was expected to include 18 contestants from tribes in the United States and Canada who will be judged on their public speaking and cultural presentations.About 3,000 singers and dancers and 800 artisans are expected to participate in the powwow. It has grown over the past three decades from focusing solely on Native American singing and dancing to a festival-like event featuring a parade, contemporary music and artisans market.The powwow has a \"long-standing history of highlighting issues of importance to Native Americans in North America,\" a spokeswoman said in a statement. It has previously promoted voter registration, youth issues and opioid abuse prevention between its marquee events, which include the twice-daily grand entry of dancers.The procession of thousands of dancers features a kaleidoscope of colors as men, women and children wearing traditional clothing and dance regalia spiral into the powwow arena. Most of the dancers compete for prize money.Organizers did not say in an emailed response to questions from the AP whether any proceeds would be shared with nonprofits addressing violence against Native American women. But they said their push for further awareness of missing and murdered indigenous women had the potential to reach 10,000 people expected to attend the powwow.In addition to encouraging pageant contestants to speak about victims' cases, organizers planned a presentation Saturday on the history of the movement to curtail deaths and disappearances of Native American women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Fontaine\u2019s body was found wrapped in a blanket, weighted down by rocks in a Winnipeg, Manitoba, river in August 2014. Her death highlighted problems with Manitoba\u2019s child welfare system, as the Aboriginal girl from Sagkeeng First Nation had been staying in government care in a hotel. Raymond Joseph Cormier, 56, who was unemployed when he was arrested in 2015, was not found guilty on Thursday of second-degree murder by a jury of seven women and four men, CBC said. (bit.ly/2CD2Pym) The verdict came about two weeks after an all-white jury acquitted a Saskatchewan farmer in the shooting death of an Aboriginal man on his property. That case has sparked calls for reforms of Canada\u2019s justice system. Aboriginals, who make up 5 percent of Canada\u2019s population, have higher levels of poverty and a lower life expectancy than other Canadians, and are more often victims of violent crime, according to government data. According to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 1,017 Aboriginal women and girls were murdered between 1980 and 2012. Another 164 went missing under suspicious circumstances between 1951 and 2012. The cause of Fontaine\u2019s death was not determined, but prosecutor Jim Ross argued that someone smothered or drowned her. Jurors heard audio recordings of Cormier from a covert police operation that Ross said included admissions of guilt.  Cormier has denied killing Fontaine, and his lawyer, Tony Kavanagh, argued that her death could have been caused by \u201cself-smothering\u201d or an overdose of alcohol and the drug gabapentin.

According to the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, Indigenous women are almost three times more likely to be killed by a stranger than non-Indigenous women, and nearly half of these cases remain unsolved.In 2016, the federal government launched an independent national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. Article Continued BelowA hundred dresses were collected by students of the Women and Gender Studies Institute, according to organizer Melissa Nesrallah. It\u2019s the largest installation of the project to date, which had a goal of collecting 600 dresses by community donations across the country. The installation will be on display until Thursday.

Manitoba Justice says the Crown will not appeal the acquittal of a man who was accused of killing 15-year-old Tina Fontaine. The Crown says in a statement that only errors in law can be appealed, and it has decided there weren't any.THE CANADIAN PRESS/ HO, Winnipeg Police Service MANDATORY CREDIT\"After a critical review ... by the Manitoba Prosecution Service's appeal unit and the Crown attorneys who prosecuted the case, it has been determined there are no grounds to base a successful appeal.\"A jury found Raymond Cormier not guilty last month of second-degree murder in the Indigenous girl's death.Her body, wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down by rocks, was pulled from the Red River eight days after she disappeared in 2014.Grand Chief Sheila North, who represents First Nations communities in northern Manitoba, said the lack of an appeal leaves people hurting.\"This is just another blow to the reality that the justice system has failed Tina Fontaine and her family,\" North said. \"It just leaves another gaping hole in the hearts of ... Indigenous people.\"James Favel, who established the volunteer Bear Clan Patrol to keep an eye on inner-city streets following Tina's death, was not surprised by the decision.\"We don't even really have the expectation of justice anymore,\" he said.Tina was raised by her great-aunt, Thelma Favel, on the Sagkeeng First Nation, 120 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg. The teen left to visit her mother in Winnipeg at the end of June 2014 and became an exploited youth.Favel called Manitoba Child and Family Services with concerns about Tina, who ran away repeatedly from a youth shelter and hotels where she was placed.She was last seen leaving a downtown hotel, where she told a private contract worker employed by child welfare that she was going to a shopping centre to meet friends.The jury heard how Tina and her boyfriend met the much-older Cormier that summer. The jury heard Cormier gave the couple a place to stay, as well as drugs.Witnesses recalled Tina and Cormier fighting in the street over a stolen truck and Tina accusing him of selling her bike for drugs. Tina went so far as to report a stolen truck to police.Witnesses testified that Cormier had a duvet cover similar to the one Tina was wrapped in.Cormier was also recorded on tape during a police undercover sting telling a woman that he would make a bet that Tina was killed because he had sex with her and then \"I found out she was 15 years old.''There was no DNA evidence linking Cormier to the teen and doctors who were called to testify said they could not definitively say how she died.The defence argued that the Crown couldn't prove that Tina didn't die from a drug overdose or naturally in what Cormier's lawyer called the \"underbelly of the city.\"Defence lawyer Anthony Kavanagh said Tuesday the acquittal was the right decision.\"The diverse and extremely representative jury did their job honourably,\" Kavanagh wrote in a text message.\"Simply put, evidence \u2014 not emotion \u2014 is required for a conviction and despite the human desire to find a convenient scapegoat, justice was done here.\"The acquittal sparked rallies of protest and support for Tina's family in cities across the country.It came weeks after another acquittal in a high-profile case in Saskatchewan.A jury found Gerald Stanley not guilty in the death of Colten Boushie, a 22-year-old Indigenous man who was shot in the head after he and some of his friends drove onto Stanley's farm.Stanley testified he thought the young people were stealing and he fired warning shots to scare them off. He said the shot that killed Boushie was an accident.Last week, the Crown in Saskatchewan also decided against an appeal in that case, saying it could find no error in law.\u2014 With files from Kelly Malone\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAdvertise With Us\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Error\nSubmit a Tip\nRefundRefund\n\n\n\nThe Brandon Sun is not accepting comments on this story.\nWhy aren't comments accepted on this story?

Wearing dark sunglasses, he said he was crying because both his mom and sister were taken from him.\"I see no cops here because they never did nothing for anything that I went through,'' he said. \"I lost everything, the closest family I have.''\"I feel everybody's pain around here. It's pretty hard that you have to go through these situations,'' he added. \"My mom was a mom to a lot of people. I know that she's always going to be with me.''\nAlex Carlick interrupts a family's testimony at the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls taking place in Whitehorse on Wednesday.Carlick left the tent in tears. The family members that had been testifying about their loved one, manslaughter victim Evangeline Billy, appeared shaken and a break was taken.All are welcome at the community hearings, said Bernee Bolton, the inquiry's spokeswoman.\"This individual recently lost his mother and although he was not scheduled to speak today, we did expect him at some time. He had something to say and the family supported family by giving him space to speak,'' she said.These occurrences are to be expected, which is why health supports are in place, she added.\"My mom was a mom to a lot of people. I know that she's always going to be with me.''\u2014 Alex Carlick\"This is all part of the healing and truth telling process.''Wendy Carlick became an advocate for slain indigenous women after her daughter was murdered, said family friend Diane Lilley. Angel Carlick's body was found in a wooded area in 2007 and her killing has not been solved, the Whitehorse Daily Star reported.The newspaper reported that Wendy Carlick was one of two women found dead in a Whitehorse home in late April. The RCMP is investigating the deaths as homicides.\"I can understand why Alex is feeling the way he is because he's all alone now,'' said Lilley. \"Wendy was a beautiful soul.''Lilley said she followed Carlick out of the tent and spoke to him outside, where he was extremely distraught. Two of his family members came to comfort him and take him away, she said.\nAlex Carlick has lost both his mother and his sister.She said she was proud of him for finding the courage to speak.\"I think that was really, really brave of him to do that,'' she said. \"Even though he interrupted, I'm really, really glad that he did that.''The incident highlights the raw emotions at the hearings, which began Tuesday. Testimony has been intense and tearful, with many relatives presenting family photographs of lost loved ones to the commissioners and speaking passionately about their legacies.Relative wants RCMP apology\n\nOne family member urged the inquiry to recommend the RCMP apologize to indigenous people.Edna Deerunner said she believes her father killed her mother, Annie Dick, in Porter Creek, Yukon, in the mid-1950s. Deerunner was just five years old at the time and said her father never faced justice.\"I think it would help us so much to have an apology to our people. I really think that would be powerful for us.''The RCMP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Some families and advocates have expressed concerns about the inquiry's terms of reference regarding police. The commissioners don't have the power to compel officers to reopen cold cases, but are examining systemic issues in the justice system.\"It's a fact that we were treated terribly. We are still being treated terribly.''\u2014 Edna DeerunnerCommissioner Qajaq Robinson asked Deerunner what sort of apology she is looking for.\"I want it to be a thorough one,'' Deerunner replied. \"It's a fact that we were treated terribly. We are still being treated terribly. So somehow we need to rebuild some kind of relationship where communication happens.''Chief commissioner Marion Buller has said previously that the inquiry will need more time and more money to complete its work, but has not said how much is needed or when the request will be made to the federal government.The federal government gave the commissioners a budget of about $53.9 million and asked them to complete their work by the end of 2018, but most family hearings will not take place until this fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\ue007\n\n\n\t\t\t\t   Canada's Missing Aboriginal Women\t\t\t\t  \n\n\n\n\nof\n\n\n\ue000\n\n\n\ue001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaisy Odjick was last seen on September 6, 2008 in Maniwaki, Quebec.

(CP)          \n\n\n\n\n\n\tGATINEAU, Que. \u2014 Family members wiped away tears Wednesday as the federal government outlined the terms of an inquiry into the phenomenon of missing and murdered aboriginal women \u2014 along with a price tag nearly $14 million higher than expected.\n\n\tThree cabinet ministers were on hand inside the Museum of Nature\u2019s great hall \u2014 a space bedecked with long houses, totem poles and artwork dedicated to Canada\u2019s First Nations \u2014 to hand the reins of the nascent inquiry to independent commissioners.\n\n\tThose commissioners will provide concrete recommendations to federal, provincial and territorial governments about how to deal with the disproportionate rates of violence and crime against Canada\u2019s indigenous women and girls.\n\nRELATED:\u00a0Five things to know about the inquiry into missing, murdered indigenous women\n\n\tJustice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould heralded Wednesday\u2019s events as evidence that the Liberal government is committed to honouring the lives of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.\n\n\tWilson-Raybould, a former B.C. regional chief for the Assembly of First Nations, appeared to be nearly overcome with emotion at one point as she looked out across a room filled with the family members of missing and murdered women.\n\n\tBy digging for root causes, including past and present systemic and institutional barriers, the commission will play a key role in defining actions needed to protect the human rights of indigenous women and girls, she said.\n\n\t\u201cWe know that the inquiry cannot undo the injustices that indigenous peoples have suffered over decades, but we can review what\u2019s happened in the past, reflect on our present circumstances, and chart a path moving forward.\u201d\n\n\tNor will the federal government wait until the end of the inquiry to take action to help curb the violence, said Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett.\n\n\tThe process \u2014 designed to be arm\u2019s length from government once it is up and running on Sept. 1 \u2014 is expected to last at least two years and cost at least $53.8 million \u2014 $13.8 million than was originally expected.\n\n\tBennett said the inquiry will reflect what the government heard during pre-inquiry consultations: that policing and child welfare policies will be put under the microscope, that it will not take a one-size-fits-all approach and will take into account regional differences when crafting recommendations.\n\n\tAs part of Wednesday\u2019s formalities, ministers delivered to the commissioners a gift basket made of birch bark, lined with sealskin and wrapped in a red Metis sash. Inside was a digital copy of all the pre-inquiry research.\n\n\tThe five commissioners responsible for carrying out the inquiry are:\n\n\t\u2014 Chief commissioner Marion Buller, B.C.\u2019s first female First Nations judge;\n\n\t\u2014 Michele Audette, a former president of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada;\n\n\t\u2014 Qajaq Robinson, an Ottawa-based, Nunavut-born lawyer who practices civil litigation with an emphasis on aboriginal law;\n\n\t\u2014 Marilyn Poitras, a professor at the University of Saskatchewan professor with a focus on indigenous law;\n\n\t\u2014 Brian Eyolfson, a First Nations lawyer based in Ontario.\n\n\tUnder the Inquiries Act, the commissioners will have the same powers as any court in a civil case to enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give evidence. They can also examine all papers, documents, vouchers, records and books belonging a public office or institution.\n\n\tFamily information liaison units will also provide centralized resources for families of missing or murdered indigenous women and girls and gather information during the inquiry process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Report a Problem\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideos\nAll videos\n\n\nLatest\nEditor's picks\nMost viewed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoney Monitor: The costs of kind...\n\n\n\n\nXavier Dolan's new drama among C...\n\n\n\n\nReactions mixed to indigenous wo...\n\n\n\n\nNew funding to complement indige...\n\n\n\n\nP.E.I. man campaigning door-to-d...\n\n\n\n\nFirst Nations say Yukon salmon d...\n\n\n\n\nNovak Djokovic not dwelling on Z...\n\n\n\n\nP.K.

autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00abIl est urgent, tr\u00e8s urgent que nous ayons un organisme de surveillance civil\u00bb, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 l\u2019ancienne pr\u00e9sidente de l\u2019Association des femmes autochtones du Canada en entrevue avec La Presse Canadienne.Pendant trois ans, \u00e0 titre de commissaire de l\u2019Enqu\u00eate nationale, elle a \u00e9cout\u00e9 les t\u00e9moignages de familles et d\u2019experts autochtones. Elle a entendu l\u2019histoire de femmes victimes de crimes qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 aid\u00e9es et de familles qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas prises au s\u00e9rieux apr\u00e8s la disparition d\u2019une des leurs. Certains ont dit ne pas avoir su vers qui se tourner lorsqu\u2019ils estimaient que la police \u00e9tait responsable de leur pr\u00e9judice.Le rapport final de l\u2019enqu\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 remis au gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en juin 2019. Il comprenait 231 \u00abappels \u00e0 la justice\u00bb, dont plusieurs concernaient une r\u00e9forme des forces polici\u00e8res et une meilleure supervision de leurs actions.Le rapport exhortait les gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et provinciaux \u00e0 cr\u00e9er des organes civils autochtones dans toutes les r\u00e9gions du pays pour superviser les enqu\u00eates polici\u00e8res sur les cas impliquant des membres des communaut\u00e9s autochtones. Mais il ne s\u2019est rien pass\u00e9 depuis, selon Mich\u00e8le Audette.Un porte-parole de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique Canada, qui est responsable du maintien de l\u2019ordre et de la surveillance polici\u00e8re, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le gouvernement s\u2019effor\u00e7ait de traiter le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate et qu\u2019il y avait eu des r\u00e9unions avec des dirigeants autochtones au sujet des pratiques des services de police.\u00a0\n\u00c0 LIRE AUSSI\n                G\u00e9nocide: l'incoh\u00e9rence du Canada face aux Autochtones point\u00e9e du doigt\n            \n                La cr\u00e9ation des pensionnats autochtones reconnue comme un \u00e9v\u00e9nement historique\n            \n                Un programme de techniques polici\u00e8res adapt\u00e9 aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s autochtones\n            \u00abBien que ce ne soit encore que le d\u00e9but, on peut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que des questions sur la surveillance efficace de la police par des civils et la relation entre la population autochtone du Canada et les services de police surgissent. Elles devront \u00eatre soigneusement \u00e9valu\u00e9es au fur et \u00e0 mesure que les travaux progresseront sur cet engagement\u00bb, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Tim Warmington dans un courriel.Ian McLeod, un porte-parole du minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de la Justice, a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas parler sp\u00e9cifiquement de la surveillance de la police, mais il a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait beaucoup de travail \u00e0 faire en ce qui concerne le soutien aux peuples autochtones.\u00abNous continuerons de travailler avec les Premi\u00e8res Nations, les Inuits et les M\u00e9tis, ainsi qu\u2019avec les partenaires provinciaux, territoriaux et municipaux pour r\u00e9pondre aux appels (de l\u2019enqu\u00eate) en faveur de la justice\u00bb, a-t-il d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans un courriel.Il existe des services sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s pour les victimes autochtones et le gouvernement fournit \u00e9galement un soutien aux programmes communautaires et aux unit\u00e9s de liaison avec les familles, a indiqu\u00e9 M. McLeod.Mich\u00e8le Audette estime que le vent a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 tourner avec les manifestations qui r\u00e9clament une r\u00e9forme des pratiques polici\u00e8res dans la foul\u00e9e de la mort de George Floyd aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Un policier qui tentait d\u2019arr\u00eater l\u2019homme noir s\u2019\u00e9tait agenouill\u00e9 sur son cou pendant pr\u00e8s de neuf minutes, alors m\u00eame que George Floyd disait qu\u2019il ne pouvait plus respirer.Plusieurs cas r\u00e9cents au paysIl existe plusieurs cas r\u00e9cents d\u2019Autochtones morts lors d\u2019interventions polici\u00e8res au Canada.Trois Autochtones\u00a0\u2014 Eishia Hudson, 16 ans, Jason Collins, 36 ans, et Stewart Andrews, 22 ans\u00a0\u2014 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9s par des agents de Winnipeg sur une p\u00e9riode de 10 jours en avril. L\u2019organisme de la province charg\u00e9 d\u2019enqu\u00eater de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante sur la police se penche sur ces dossiers.\u00c0 Toronto, Regis Korchinski-Paquet, une femme autochtone noire de 29 ans,\u00a0a perdu la vie en tombant d\u2019un balcon au mois de mai alors que des policiers avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s dans son appartement. Sa famille a critiqu\u00e9 l\u2019Unit\u00e9 des enqu\u00eates sp\u00e9ciales de l\u2019Ontario pour avoir innocent\u00e9 les agents et pour avoir conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de \u00abracisme manifeste\u00bb dans le comportement des policiers. Sur les 52 enqu\u00eateurs de cette unit\u00e9, deux sont autochtones et trois sont noirs.En juin, deux Autochtones sont morts dans des interventions polici\u00e8res au Nouveau-Brunswick, dont Chantel Moore, 26 ans, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9\u00a0tu\u00e9e par balle lorsque la police a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 son domicile pour v\u00e9rifier son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Le Bureau des enqu\u00eates ind\u00e9pendantes du Qu\u00e9bec a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 pour examiner les circonstances de la mort de la jeune femme.\u00a0Aucun enqu\u00eateur de cette unit\u00e9 n\u2019est autochtone.Mich\u00e8le Audette estime que ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements illustrent la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 que des Autochtones puissent surveiller le d\u00e9roulement de ces enqu\u00eates. \u00abM\u00eame si vous \u00eates une bonne personne, c\u2019est la structure, la culture et (\u2026) la discrimination syst\u00e9mique ou le racisme\u00bb, a-t-elle dit. \u00abBrisons ce cycle en ayant un organisme civil.\u00bbFondamentalement, la pi\u00e8ce manquante est qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas assez de volont\u00e9 politique et qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas assez de d\u00e9sir pour les institutions de vraiment s\u2019attaquer \u00e0 ces probl\u00e8mes.grand chef Arlen Dumas, de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des chefs du ManitobaLe grand chef Arlen Dumas, de l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des chefs du Manitoba, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations de sa province r\u00e9clamaient une r\u00e9forme depuis des d\u00e9cennies. Il a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 la commission \u00abAboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba\u00bb, qui a enqu\u00eat\u00e9 sur le meurtre brutal d\u2019Helen Betty Osborne en 1971 et sur la mort par balle de John Joseph Harper par la police de Winnipeg en 1988.La mort de M. Harper avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019origine consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un accident, mais l\u2019enqu\u00eate a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que l\u2019agent avait utilis\u00e9 une force excessive.Personne n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9 pour la mort d\u2019Helen Betty Osborne pendant 16 ans. La commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate avait conclu que les facteurs les plus importants ayant contribu\u00e9 au prolongement du processus judiciaire dans le cas de la jeune femme crie \u00e9taient le racisme, le sexisme et l\u2019indiff\u00e9rence des Blancs.\u00abFondamentalement, la pi\u00e8ce manquante est qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas assez de volont\u00e9 politique et qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas assez de d\u00e9sir pour les institutions de vraiment s\u2019attaquer \u00e0 ces probl\u00e8mes\u00bb, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 Arlen Dumas.Il dit tout de m\u00eame avoir de l\u2019espoir que la pression actuelle pour une r\u00e9forme des pratiques polici\u00e8res aboutisse enfin \u00e0 des changements concrets. \u00abLe seul recours, en fait, est d\u2019avoir une perspective ind\u00e9pendante et objective des Premi\u00e8res Nations sur la surveillance de ces questions.\u00bb\u00c0 VOIR AUSSI:\u00a0COVID-19: effets sur la criminalit\u00e9 au Canada\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvoyer une correction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly Geraldine Malone\n\nLa Presse Canadienne\n\n\n\n\n\nPLUS: politique  justice autochtones premi\u00e8res nations police s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique inuits Mich\u00e8le Audette enqu\u00eate nationale femmes autochtones disparues M\u00e9tis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Populaires\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGemma Arterton ne veut plus jouer de \u00abBond girl\u00bb pour une bonne raison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDes marins dans les limbes partout\u00a0\u00e0 travers le monde en raison de la pand\u00e9mie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoil\u00e0 o\u00f9 est pass\u00e9e une partie de l'argent lev\u00e9 par le \u00abIce Bucket Challenge\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChaudi\u00e8re-Appalaches: un conducteur arr\u00eat\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir happ\u00e9 mortellement un cycliste\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeux hommes violemment agress\u00e9s en Beauce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\u00e8gles sanitaires: la police intervient dans deux bars de Sherbrooke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUIVEZ-NOUS\n\n\n\nAvec l'infolettre, recevez par courriel les nouvelles les plus pertinentes et les articles les plus populaires du jour.\n            Politique de confidentialit\u00e9\n\n\n\nInfolettre\n\n\nVeuillez entrer une adresse valide\n\n\n\n\nMerci pour votre inscription!

And it must end.\"\n\nA Royal Canadian Mounted Police report before the inquiry was formed found that while indigenous women represent about 4.3 percent of the total female population, they account for 16 percent of all female homicide victims. That study reviewed cases from 1980 to 2013 and found 1,181 First Natons women fell into the missing or murdered category \u2014 almost double earlier estimates. Of those women, 164 were missing and 1,017 murdered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\"To the missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls of Canada, to their families, and to survivors \u2014 We have failed you\" Trudeau said. \"But we will fail you no longer.\"\n\nMich\u00e8le Audette, one of the commissioners of the inquiry, said they heard from women and family members that the justice system does not work for indigenous people. \"They don't matter when they go through that system,\" Audette said.\n\nAudette said she was disappointed Trudeau didn't use the word \"genocide,\" and said, \"I was hoping he would have that courage.\"\n\n\n\nBut chief inquiry commissioner Marion Buller said they didn't need Trudeau to use the word.\n\n\"We often think of genocide as the holocaust and the killings in Africa and elsewhere and of course that is genocide, and of course that is tragedy, but that type of genocide we have in Canada is ... death by a million paper cuts for generations,\" Buller said.\n\nThe report said police and the justice system need to acknowledge that the historical and current relationship with Indigenous people has been largely defined by \"colonialism, racism, bias, discrimination, and fundamental cultural and societal differences.\"\n\nQajaq Robinson, another one of commissioners, said violence against indigenous women can happen with impunity in Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBrenda Lucki, the commissioner of Canada's national police force, noted that when she appeared before the inquiry last year, she apologized to the families of missing and murdered on behalf of the RCMP and promised the force would do better to investigate the cases and support families.\n\nLucki also said in a statement that investigators across Canada are actively reviewing files of missing and murdered women and said the RCMP would study the inquiry report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n \n\n\n\n1\n\n\n    \n        As Walmart turns to robots, it's the human workers who feel like machines\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n    \n        19-year-old dies by electrocution while cutting palm tree in west Laredo\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n    \n        Woman jailed for stealing at Home Depot using stroller\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n    \n        Trio of men arrested after beer stolen from south Laredo corner store\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n    \n        Construction of entertainment complex at Mall del Norte underway\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n    \n        Former LISD band director charged with theft from school fundraiser\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n    \n        Photos: WWE Smackdown ignites Laredo audiences\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n    \n        Prosecutor: Mom of baby killed by fentanyl in sippy cup wanted to 'relax and smoke marijuana'\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n    \n        Electric scooters now a transportation option in Laredo\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n    \n        Long-awaited south Laredo water park opens to the public\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n View Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2019 Hearst Communications, Inc.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nLogo\nReturn to Top\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nPrivacy Notice\nYour California Privacy Rights\nInterest Based Ads\nTerms of Use\nOur Company\nCareers\n\n\n\nContact\n\nContact Us\nToday's eEdition\n\n\n\nConnect\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nHearst Newspapers\n\u00a9 Copyright  Hearst Newspapers, LLC\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The inquiry spent nearly three years holding public hearings, gathering more than 1,000 hours of testimony from 2,300 witnesses, often the families of victims and survivors. Its recommendations center on supporting Indigenous police services, overhauling current police procedures to address MMIW cases, changing criminal codes and reforming child welfare, APTN News reported.\u201cI was really pleased to see that the commission that had come together really explicitly stated that this is an ongoing genocide,\u201d said Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Health Institute and chief research officer at the Seattle Indian Health Board. \u201cTo me, that was a powerful and necessary and needed statement.\u201d In Canada, as in the U.S., the number of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls is disputed: The Royal Canadian Mounted Police estimated that 1,200 individuals had disappeared or been murdered since 1980, but the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada puts the figure for the last few decades at 4,000.The report also focused on Indigenous people who identify as 2SLGBTQQIA, which stands for two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex and/or asexual. Indigenous women who align with 2SLGBTQQIA identify markers are sometimes targeted for their sexual orientation and gender identity, \u201ccreating what one researcher describes as \u2018triple jeopardy\u2019 for various forms of interpersonal and institutional violence,\u201d the report reads. This is not the first time the word \u201cgenocide\u201d has been used to describe the crisis \u2013 activists and researchers like Echo-Hawk have invoked it when discussing violence toward Indigenous women and girls \u2013 but it rarely appears in government-sponsored reports. The report, as Vice noted, drew on Polish-Jewish scholar Raphael Lemkin\u2019s definition of the term. Rather than the \u201cimmediate destruction of a nation,\u201d Lemkin sees genocide as a more insidious force, \u201ca coordinated plan of different actions aiming at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups, with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves,\u201d as the report quotes. Trudeau, the Canadian press pointed out, avoided the term in his speech at the museum, instead saying that violence against Indigenous women and girls is \u201cnot a relic of Canada\u2019s past.\u201d But other speakers refused to let the Canadian government, and non-Indigenous citizens, off the hook. \u201cAn absolute paradigm shift is required to dismantle colonialism in Canadian society,\u201d Marion Buller, chief commissioner of the inquiry, concluded.Some think the report\u2019s strong language doesn\u2019t go far enough. \u201cWithout oversight or legally binding laws, these are just lofty words while Indigenous women and girls continue to die,\u201d McGill University social work professor Cindy Blackstock, a member of the Gitksan First Nation and executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, told the New York Times. The United States, meanwhile, has no such report, nor does it have a commission for producing one \u2013 despite the fact that Native women in the U.S. are murdered at a rate 10 times higher than the national average. \u201cAs we look at what\u2019s happening in the U.S., I believe that that genocide didn\u2019t stop at artificial borders between two governments,\u201d Abigail Echo-Hawk said. \u201cI hope that this report and its impact internationally will help elevate the conversation in the United States.\u201dIn December 2018, the U.S. Senate held a hearing on the crisis. Outgoing Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., who oversaw it, proposed legislation to repair the Department of Justice\u2019s guidelines for responding to the cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women. But her bill, Savanna\u2019s Act, had to be reintroduced this year after Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., blocked it in one of his final acts before leaving office. The Canadian inquiry\u2019s recommendations, framed by Indigenous-led services, human rights and trauma-informed approaches, could provide a useful example for the U.S. As the report says, \u201cIt must be understood that these recommendations, which we frame as \u2018Calls for Justice,\u2019 are legal imperatives \u2013 they are not optional.\u201dThis article was first published on hcn.org.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018This is genocide\u2019: Canada\u2019s inquiry into missing and murdered women\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      At the Inquiry\u2019s closing ceremony, Chief Commissioner Marion Buller said that \u201can absolute paradigm shift is required to dismantle colonialism in Canadian society.\u201d\n    \n\n        Andrew Meade/AFP/Getty Images\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Local News\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHillcrest Golf Club sued over tee box placement\n\n\n\n \nMancos Town Board continues discussing encroachment issues\n\n\n \nLocal student graduates from California State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideos & Photos\n\nVideos And Photos Left\nVideos And Photos Right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nVideo: Graphic recording\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nVideo: Art Goodtimes lit fest\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGallery: Ute Mountain Roundup rodeo\n \nThe annual Ute Mountain Roundup Rodeo Friday night  in Cortez.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nVideo: Escalante lambs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGallery: The 416 Fire, one year later\n \nThanks to plenty of snow over the winter and a wet spring, plants are beginning to cover the burn area of the 416 Fire, north of Durango.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGallery: Montezuma-Cortez commencement\n \nMontezuma-Cortez High School's Class of 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Calendar\n\n\nclick here to add your event\n  \n\n    Area Events\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Events\n\n\nFull Calendar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\nMost Recent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSix inner-tubers rescued on Dolores River\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBoys spur search and rescue effort after falling from raft\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPolice arrest drunken man with rifle after brief manhunt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nHillcrest Golf Club sued over tee box placement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMancos Town Board continues discussing encroachment issues\n\n\n\n\nLocal student graduates from California State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsupported Browser Alert\n\n\n\nThe browser you are currently using has been discontinued by its developers.

The Government of Canada dedicated $53.8 million to the independent National Inquiry, and provided terms of reference and a timeline of two years to complete its important work, which began on September\u00a01, 2016. An Interim Report with recommendations was released in November 2017.\u00a0\nIn response to recommendations in the Inquiry\u2019s Interim report released in November\u00a02017, Canada announced investments in healing and health supports for survivors, family members and others affected by the issue of murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls; helping victims\u2019 families access information about their loved ones; commemoration of the lives and legacies of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and members of LGBTQ2S communities; and supporting the establishment of a national investigative oversight body at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. These initiatives ensure action in key areas does not wait for the conclusion of the National Inquiry. It is anticipated that the initiatives will better position the Government to respond to the Inquiry\u2019s final report.\nThe Path Forward\nThe Government of Canada announced on June\u00a05,\u00a02018, that the National Inquiry would be granted an extension and that it would have until April\u00a030,\u00a02019 to submit its final report, instead of the initial date of November\u00a01,\u00a02018. The extension to submit the report meant that the Commissioners chose to extend the time, up to December\u00a02018, to hear from additional families and survivors, further examine institutional practices and policies, and undertake the research necessary to inform their recommendations on the systemic causes of all forms of violence against Indigenous women and girls in Canada. The National Inquiry has until June\u00a030,\u00a02019, to wind down its work.\u00a0\nThis approach acknowledged that there were more survivors and family members who wanted to share their experiences, while underscoring the urgency that this Government places on seeing the National Inquiry deliver concrete recommendations to address systemic and institutional issues to help keep Indigenous women and girls safe. It also provided an opportunity for the National Inquiry\u2019s final recommendations to be informed by further expert or institutional hearings and research. Public hearings and submissions from parties with standing were completed in December 2018.\u00a0\nMissing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Commemoration Fund\nOne of the recommendations of the National Inquiry\u2019s interim report was the establishment of a commemoration fund. The Department for Women and Gender Equality has established this fund which provides $10\u00a0million over two years to help honour the lives and legacies of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and LGBTQ2S individuals.\nThrough a Call for Proposals from the Department\u2019s Women\u2019s Program, the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Commemoration Fund will support Indigenous governments and organizations, including Indigenous women\u2019s organizations and Two-Spirit organizations, to work with families and communities to develop and implement commemorative initiatives. Families and communities targeted are First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit.\nOrganizations who are eligible to apply are:\n\nIndigenous governments, including band councils, tribal councils, self-government entities and their agencies, and hamlets; and,\nIndigenous organizations. including Indigenous women\u2019s organizations and Two-Spirit organizations\n\nAn Indigenous organization is an incorporated organization that represents First Nations, Inuit and/or M\u00e9tis interests and is controlled by members of the population it serves.\n\n\n\nCommemorative initiatives eligible for funding may include, but are not limited to:\n\nEvents that contribute to healing by acknowledging those who were murdered or disappeared and by bringing people together to share and support one another.\n\n\nFor example: banquets, pow-wows, talking circles, potlatches, closing ceremonies, healing circles, welcome home ceremonies, lecture series, and art or music workshops.\n\n\nCommemoration items that leave a legacy or that educate people about missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, including LGBTQ2S people.\n\n\nFor example: community monuments, plaques, cairns, totem poles, murals, and not-for-profit films or books and education curricula.\n\n\nRegional or national coordination and support of commemoration events and initiatives.\n\n\nDevelopment and implementation of region-wide or nation-wide commemoration initiatives.\n\n\nFor example: gatherings for remembrance and healing.\n\nAs the National Inquiry noted in its interim report, public commemoration is a powerful way to help honour truths, support healing, create awareness, and to advance reconciliation.\nOrganizations and governments can submit an application to the Call for Proposals by visiting women.gc.ca. The deadline to submit is March 28, 2019 at 11:59 a.m. (noon) Pacific Standard Time.\nMIL OSI Canada News \u2013\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\t\t\t\u00a0 Print \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\t\t\t\u00a0 Email\n\n\nPublished: 1 min ago on February 3, 2019\nBy: \nLast Modified: February 3, 2019 @ 7:08 am\nFiled Under: AM-NC, america, Americas, Canada, CTF, DJF, Economy, Education, English, Government of Canada, Government of Canada - MIL OSI National News, Health, Investment, KB, MIL OSI, Open Source Intel, Pacific, Pacific Region, Police, Trade\n\n\n\nNEXT ARTICLE \u2192MIL-OSI Canada: Government of Canada Launches Commemoration Fund for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls\n\n\n\n\nAbout the author\n \nView all articles by   \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchives Archives\n\nSelect Month\n February 2019 \u00a0(2334)\n January 2019 \u00a0(24251)\n December 2018 \u00a0(26061)\n November 2018 \u00a0(28523)\n\n  Recent Posts \n\nMIL-OSI Canada: Backgrounder \u2013 Government of Canada Launches Commemoration Fund for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls\nFebruary 3, 2019\n\n\nMIL-OSI Canada: Government of Canada Launches Commemoration Fund for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls\nFebruary 3, 2019\n\n\nMIL-OSI New Zealand: Serious crash, Tauriko\nFebruary 3, 2019\n\n\nMIL-OSI Security: Readout of Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker\u2019s Trip to Bogot\u00e1, Colombia\nFebruary 3, 2019\n\n\nMIL-OSI United Nations: UN calls for support to implement Central Africa\u2019s newly minted peace agreement\nFebruary 3, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultimedia Investments Ltd\nPrivacy Policy\nCookies Notice\nTerms of Use\n \n \u00a9 2019 ForeignAffairs.co.nz.

It was wrong.By Emma McIntosh\u00a0in\u00a0Analysis, Politics\u00a0|\nJune 7th 2019 \n\n\n#11 of 11 articles from the Special Report:\n\nElection Integrity Reporting Project \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nA public closing ceremony marked the conclusion of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls at the Museum of History in Gatineau, QC on June 3, 2019. Photo by Andrew Meade \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious story \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women released its final report this week, you may have seen a statistic claiming Indigenous men killed 70 per cent of murdered Indigenous women.\nThe number was cited by white nationalist Faith Goldy, former editor-in-chief of The Walrus magazine Jonathan Kay and reams of others on social media who sought to undermine the report's finding that Canada's treatment of Indigenous people is genocide.\nProblem is, there\u2019s no published research that supports the figure. It's based on years of sloppily collected RCMP data that doesn't examine the actual problems underlying violence against Indigenous women, and is grounded in racist assumptions about Indigenous people.\n\n\nHave you seen the claim that Indigenous men killed 70 per cent of murdered Indigenous women? It's false, and relies on inaccurate data and racist assumptions. #cdnpoli #MMIWG \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we have is people cherrypicking evidence and choosing evidence that supports their point of view without sharing with the public the limitations of what they're relying on, or putting that information in context,\" said Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada and member of the Gitksan First Nation.\n\"It's really disturbing to me, because how are we to engender an understanding in Canadians about the experiences and the contributions of First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit people when there's this kind of fabricated evidence being shared around?\"\nThe federal government began the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in late 2015, and appointed five commissioners the following August. For three years, the inquiry studied systemic violence against Indigenous women and girls, delivering its final report and recommendations Monday.\n\n\n\n\nThe final report included an entire section devoted to debunking the 70 per cent figure: \"The often-cited statistic that Indigenous men are responsible for 70 per cent of murders of Indigenous women and girls is not factually based,\" it concluded.\nAccording to the inquiry, the statistic first surfaced in March 2015 when then-Indigenous affairs minister Bernard Valcourt mentioned it in a meeting with several chiefs in Calgary, several months after claiming the issue with on-reserve violence was a lack of respect for women. The next month, then-RCMP commissioner Bob Paulson released a statement confirming the stat. However, the RCMP never divulged how it arrived at the number, which was never included in any official reports.\nOn Friday, reacting to a news story based on an advanced copy of the MMWIG report, Valcourt said on Twitter that the findings were \"propagandist\" and said it had come to a \"thunderous silly conclusion.\" (The Conservative party later distanced itself, with Conservative MP Cathy McLeod, the shadow minister of Indigenous affairs, tweeting that Valcourt's comments were \"unacceptable\" and didn't represent the party's views.)\nThe inquiry's report also noted that, up until very recently, RCMP didn't even record whether victims or offenders were Indigenous. And such data that does exist was reported inconsistently. \"The RCMP have not proven to Canada that they are capable of holding themselves to account \u2014 and, in fact, many of the truths shared here speak to ongoing issues of systemic and individual racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination that prevent honest oversight from taking place,\" the report said.\nThe 70 per cent figure also fails to account for the numerous missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls whose deaths weren't recorded as homicides, and leaves out unsolved cases, the inquiry found. After reviewing cases, the inquiry \"believes that there were repeated instances... of police mischaracterizing disappearances and deaths as 'not suspicious,\" the report said.\n\"The fact is, that number is not substantiated,\" said commissioner Qajaq Robinson, a Nunavut-raised lawyer, who is not Indigenous. \"It's also quite concerning that (this) kind of number and that kind of determination is being made when it's so clear that the data is incredibly unreliable.\"\nUnderlying the spread of the 70 per cent myth is a racist assumption that Indigenous people are inherently violent or uncivil, said Robert Henry, an assistant professor at the University of Calgary who studies Indigenous justice issues. It allows people who believe it to blame Indigenous men rather than examining their own roles in colonialism as it manifests today \u2014 something that must happen if society is to change in any meaningful way, he added.\n\"(The false statistic) maintains the idea that Indigenous men and Indigenous people are ... doing it to themselves and it's not part of the larger structural issues of colonialism that have impacted Indigenous people,\" Henry said. \"We need the broader Canadian society to unlearn what we've learned and understand that we're all complicit in this.\"\nThough it's wonderful that Canadians are engaging with the ideas in the report, Robinson said, it's \"quite concerning\" that some are quibbling over the finer points rather than figuring how to fix the enormous problems at play.\n\"Making those kinds of statements is dangerous and it mischaracterizes the situation,\" she added. \"Debating semantics isn't going to get us there.\"\nAfter the inquiry's final report was released, current RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki promised that the organization would review its findings and recommendations.\nViolence does happen between Indigenous men and women, said Blackstock of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, but it's also important to understand the role intergenerational trauma caused by colonialism plays in that violence \u2014 the effects of residential schools and the Sixties Scoop, among other things, contribute to the cycle of violence.\nThe inquiry report also said men's healing must be part of the reconciliation process.\n\"It's not to excuse the behaviour,\" Blackstock said. \"People need to be accountable and that behavior needs to end, but it is an additional contextual factor.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this article.Share\u00a0on FacebookShare\u00a0on Twitter\n\n\n\nJune 7th 2019Emma McIntosh\n\n\n\n\nComments \n\nYour name *\n\n\n\nE-mail *\n\nThe content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.\n\n\nComment *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field blank \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have followed this story\n\nVal D.  | Sat, 06/08/2019 - 05:36 \n\n\nI have followed this story with concern for the safety of indigenous women. Not in depth as there are so many other topics if interest in the news. But I am now confused. I never thought to ask who specifically did the killing as a group. I never heard about the 70% number. I never thought about violence by indigenous men against indigenous women until this article. But now that I read the article I am wondering more about what that number refers to in the RCMP report. I see our concern over colonialism and our indirect responsibility in disrupting a way of life, but then is it true that indigenous men do such killing more?! I somehow always thought it was deep anger against women and/or racism by some men who likely did this. Regardless of ethnicity.

The ministers are also expected to meet the families of some victims following the announcement.\nIt is expected to be a highly emotional day for a number of long-time advocates who have repeatedly called on the federal government to open a national public inquiry into the phenomenon of missing and murdered indigenous women.\nThe study _ resisted by the Conservative government of former prime minister Stephen Harper _ was a key Liberal campaign promise during the last federal election.\nSheila North Wilson, grand chief of an organization representing First Nations in northern Manitoba, said Tuesday she hopes the study will help unravel the \u201cmassive problem\u201d piece by piece.\nShe said she\u2019s hoping the government will speak \u201cdirectly to the hearts and minds\u201d of indigenous families on Wednesday.\nDuring the course of their work, the commissioners will have the power to summon witnesses and compel testimony.\nTwo central questions for the upcoming process include how long will the study take and how much will it all cost?\nThe federal government has earmarked $40 million over two years for the inquiry but Bennett has said this is a placeholder budget and stressed the need to get the process \u201cright.\u201d\nIt is expected that the commissioners could face a number of challenges during the course of their work, such as the need to examine the nature of violence against indigenous women in urban centres and in indigenous communities themselves.\nJoan Jack, an Ojibway activist from Manitoba, has stressed the need for the inquiry to look at what is happening on reserve.\nWomen are routinely oppressed and subjected to violence, she said.\n\u201cIt is only the very strongest and very connected women that are able to rise above that,\u201d Jack said in an interview Tuesday.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a level of violence in our communities that is a crisis and no one seems to care.\u201d\nThere will have to be a lot of healing inside communities, North Wilson said, adding she hopes Canadians will use the inquiry process to better understand what is happening to indigenous women and girls.\n\u201cWe have a lot to contribute as indigenous women and girls,\u201d\u00a0North Wilson said.\n\u201cWe want the same thing that everybody wants, \u00a0we want health, we want equality, we want jobs, we want to be educated and we want opportunities \u2026\u00a0 we should be afforded that. That\u2019s at the heart of the issue \u2026 it is a Canadian problem.\u201d\nIn May 2014, the RCMP released a report documenting 1,181 murdered and missing women between 1980 and 2012.\nA year later, it said 32 \u00a0aboriginal women had been murdered and11 more had disappeared since it first reported on the issue.\nThe RCMP also noted there is an \u201cunmistakable connection between homicide and family violence.\u201d\nThe force said the relationship between victim and offender was particularly relevant because more than 90 per cent of the women in the homicide data were known to the offender.\nMistrust toward police forces and the need to examine officer conduct is also expected to be a central theme of the inquiry process.\nFive things about the inquiry set to study missing and murdered indigenous women\nBy: Kristy Kirkup The Canadian Press Published on Tue Aug 02 2016\n\n\n\n\nOTTAWA \u2014 The federal government is expected to announce Wednesday the terms of an inquiry examining the cases of missing and murdered indigenous women.\n\n\nHere are five things to know about the process:\n\n\n1. Indigenous organizations\u00a0have been calling for an inquiry: Groups, including the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada and the Assembly of First Nations, have for years urged the federal government to open a national public inquiry into the phenomenon of missing and murdered indigenous women. They will closely examine the terms of reference\u00a0and the commissioners selected. There are five people expected to sit on the body.\n\n\nIn May 2014, the RCMP\u00a0released a report documenting\u00a01,181 murdered and missing women between 1980 and 2012. A year later,\u00a0it said\u00a032 aboriginal women had been murdered and 11 more disappeared since it first reported on the issue.\n\n\n2. The Liberal government plans to be flexible on timeline and funding: The federal government has banked on spending $40 million over the next two years on the inquiry but some observers already wonder if this will be enough money and time for the commissioners to do their work. Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett has noted this is a \u201cplaceholder\u201d budget and she\u00a0has consistently stressed the need to get the inquiry right.\n\n\n3. The previous government did not support\u00a0an inquiry: Former prime minister Stephen Harper opposed\u00a0a formal examination\u00a0of the issue of murdered and missing indigenous women. He noted there were already a number of studies on the record and stressed the need for action.\n\n\n4. The commission will be able to compel witnesses to testify: Under the Inquiries Act,\u00a0the\u00a0commissioners will have the\u00a0same powers as any court in a civil case to enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give evidence. They may also examine all papers, documents, vouchers, records and books belonging\u00a0a public office or institution.\n\n\n5. Child welfare is expected to be a central theme of the study: Bennett says child welfare will be a key issue. She said the government has repeatedly heard about the \u201cdevastating\u201d impact on children who are apprehended and what often happens to their mothers.\n\n\n\nThe government is currently engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal over federal funding for child welfare services on reserve.\n\n\nIn January, the tribunal ruled the federal government discriminated against First Nations children in its funding of child welfare service\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

She was supposed to have been in a group or foster home in Winnipeg, but she had run away.\nWinnipeg police say Raymond Joseph Cormier, 53, was arrested in Vancouver this week. He remained in custody on Friday while arrangements were being made to return him to Winnipeg.\n\u201cInvestigators know that Tina was highly vulnerable and was exploited during her time on the run,\u201d deputy police Chief Danny Smyth said at a news conference in Winnipeg.\n\u201cInvestigators discovered that Tina frequented a residence on the east side of the city. Investigators also discovered that Raymond Cormier often frequented that same residence.\n\u201cIt\u2019s believed that Tina and Cormier were acquainted.\u201d\nSmyth said Cormier is originally from New Brunswick but has lived in Winnipeg for some years. Smyth said Cormier has a long criminal history with convictions across the country that include violent offences.\nCalls for an inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women intensified after Fontaine\u2019s death, but the Harper Conservatives refused to hold one. The new federal Liberal government announced this week that it will go ahead.\n\u201cThe murder of this child, and let\u2019s not forget she was a child, has shocked and outraged our community. And I think that outrage has resonated across the nation,\u201d Smyth said.\nTina had spent much of her life with her great-aunt, Thelma Favel, on the Sagkeeng First Nation, about 70 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg. The girl had a history of running away and went to Winnipeg about a month before her death to visit her biological mother.\nFavel had asked a child-welfare agency for help with Tina.\nThe girl was in a vehicle pulled over by two officers more than a week after she was first reported missing July 31, 2014, but she was not taken into custody. Her body was found nine days later.\nPolice said their investigation had not determined whether the officers knew Tina\u2019s identity at the time, or whether they were aware she had been reported missing.\nFavel said the officers did know the girl had been reported missing. She said that social workers told her that on that night _ a few hours after police came across Tina, the girl was found passed out in an alley downtown. Paramedics took her to a nearby hospital.\nFavel said Tina was kept for a few hours until she sobered up, then social workers picked her up at the hospital. She ran away again, was reported missing again, and was found in the river on Aug. 17.\n\u201cSociety would be horrified if we found a litter of kittens or pups in the river in this condition. This is a child. Society should be horrified,\u201d Sgt. John O\u2019Donovan said at the time the body was discovered.\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

The government followed the announcement with 17 information sessions to hear from families across the country about what they wanted from the inquiry and how the terms of reference should be written. \u00a0Part of what the government heard was:\n\n\u00a0\nPart of what the government heard was:\n\nThe leadership should represent Indigenous communities and regions.\nIt should also have a timetable that is sensitive to the needs of survivors, families and loved ones.\nEfforts must be made to avoid a long, drawn-out and legal process.\nThe inquiry should include as many individuals and organizations as possible including survivors, families and loved ones, national Indigenous organizations, front-line workers, and Indigenous community leaders and organizations.\nIt should also respect different points of view.\nThe inquiry should take a broad approach to its analysis of the issues. It should look at the economic, cultural, political and social causes of violence against women, girls and trans and two-spirit people.\nIt should also look at the causes of unequal and unjust treatment of Indigenous women, girls and trans and two-spirit people and recommend solutions to the causes of violence.\nThe inquiry should provide a variety of cultural, spiritual and religious supports and ceremonies.\nThe ceremonies should reflect the diversity of all participants and regions and be supported by elders.\nAs well, it will be critical to have professional mental health counselling and community-based health supports. Professional and culturally-sensitive counselling will be needed if the inquiry is to be effective and avoid causing further trauma.\n\nPolice have been a focus of many families and groups who are looking to the inquiry to find answers.\nIn June, Assembly of First Nations National Chief addressed a conference of Canadian police forces telling those gathered that he was \u201cputting them on notice\u201d because families wanted answers on how investigators handled these cases.\n\nPolice services across the country have long been criticized for their handling of cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women\u00a0and a number of families are awaiting news about how police forces will be scrutinized during the inquiry.\nIn July, APTN National News was the first to obtain a draft of the terms of reference that will guide five commissioners in their duties. While police are not mentioned specifically, the early draft seems to give the commissioners the leeway to examine any institution they believe needs to appear at the inquiry.\nBut what can a national inquiry accomplish? Are there limitations?\nThe Women\u2019s Legal, Education, Action Fund is a coalition of advocacy groups including the Aboriginal Legal Services of Toronto that legal action to advance women\u2019s issues.\nAccording to Christa Big Canoe, the organisations involved are watching the process to put together the inquiry. \u00a0and has prepared a FAQ on what an\nIn anticipation of the national inquiry call, it prepared a FAQ on what an inquiry can and cannot do\nIt is reproduced here.\n\n#1: What is a national Commission of Inquiry?\nNational Commissions of Inquiry are federally established investigations into issues of national importance. Federal inquiries are established under terms set out in the Inquiries Act. This Act says that the federal Cabinet can establish an inquiry at any time.\n\nCabinet also has the discretion to determine the inquiry\u2019s subject and scope. The Act is broad and gives the federal government ample discretion, so there is a lot of room for flexibility and creativity in designing the inquiry process. This can help to ensure a future inquiry will be a meaningful and sensitive process that includes diverse stakeholders.\nHowever, this also means that early and thorough research and consultation is especially important, as this will help inform the inquiry\u2019s design so that it can facilitate and support a fair, responsive, and effective process.\n\n#2: How is it different from a Truth and Reconciliation Commission or a Royal Commission?\nInquiries can take several forms. Royal commissions are a type of public inquiry. They receive a special seal from the Queen, but otherwise are not different from other types of public inquiry.\n\nTruth and reconciliation commissions are generally created to address mass human rights violations in a country\u2019s past, usually as a country is transitioning from autocratic to democratic rule.\nCanada\u2019s recent Truth and Reconciliation Commission was unique because it was established as one part of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement, which was negotiated by residential school survivors, churches that operated the schools, and the federal government.\n\n#3: How long do inquiries usually last from start to finish?\nThe length of an inquiry can be decided by the government or the Commissioners at the start of the inquiry process, and the Commission is expected to keep to its deadlines.\n\nPast inquiries have varied considerably in length. For example, the Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women lasted two years, the Manitoba Aboriginal Justice Inquiry took three years, and the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples lasted five years.\n\n#4: Who can establish an inquiry?\nNational Commissions of Inquiry are established by the federal Cabinet.\n#5: What could inquiry proceedings look like?\nThe Commission has the power to determine the methods of an inquiry. Some Commission meetings and proceedings may be open to the general public and informal in nature. These could involve open houses, or opportunities to submit written comments.\n\nA Commission may also decide to have some proceedings that are adversarial (i.e. court-like) hearings with witnesses, cross-examination, and legal representation. This format is adopted when Commissioners feel the need to test the evidence of presenters to sort out an unclear or contested situation. These types of proceeding may require the involvement of lawyers.\nA commission may also hold closed hearings for highly delicate evidence, or the Commission may hold invitational symposia (i.e. meetings that are only open to those who are personally invited) or other meetings to hear the views of experts or certain key stakeholders. Again, the wide discretion of the Commission with regards to designing its own process is important to keep in mind. A Commission can use any combination of the above-mentioned types of process.\nIt can also design new and unique types of proceeding.\n\n#6: Who will be able to participate in these proceedings?\nParticipation in an inquiry may depend on the type or format of the proceedings.\n\nFor open and informal proceedings, the Commission may encourage widespread public participation, usually by means of written comments submitted on paper or electronically, or by presenting to Commissioners in person.\nAdversarial hearings may require standing to participate. This means that people who want to participate in the hearing process will need to establish either: 1) how they are affected by the issues being addressed in the hearing, or 2) how their participation would further the public interest. In this situation, the Commission would have the discretion to determine how it will assess whether individual applicants should have standing.\nThe Commission would also have the authority to determine who will be granted standing. In addition to granting standing to participate in this sort of proceeding, a Commission has power under the Inquiries Act to require the attendance of witnesses through subpoenas. While formal in nature, these adversarial 3 proceedings do have the potential to delve into contested or unclear\u00a0proceedings do have the potential to delve into contested or unclear situations in search of a full picture of what has happened.\nA Commission may also restrict participation to certain groups or individuals, depending on the issue being considered. For example, closed hearings may only be open to people who are personally invited.\n\n#7: How will members of the public know whether they can participate?\nOnce a Commission of Inquiry is established and has designed its process, there will likely be some form of public notice informing members of the public about upcoming opportunities to participate in the inquiry. Such notices should also specify the means by which members of the public and interested parties will be able to participate.\n#8: Could funding be available to inquiry participants?\nA key issue for any Commission of Inquiry, and for its potential participants, is whether funding will be available to those from whom the Commission wishes to hear (i.e. grants standing to). In the past, such funding has been available at some Commissions for those taking part in either the fact-finding part of the Inquiry or its policy deliberations. It is useful to explore the practices of past Commissions to see how this funding is determined, as each Commission can establish its own rules and practices. However, as the Missing Women Inquiry in B.C. has demonstrated, it is essential that the government which establishes the Inquiry provide it with enough funding to permit it to grant funding to participants who need it. Some experts have provided guidance for setting up future Commissions of Inquiry funding mechanisms.\n#9: What languages can an inquiry be conducted in? \nThere are no specific provisions in the Inquiries Act concerning which language an inquiry must use in its proceedings. Most national Commissions of Inquiry in the past have generally been conducted in either English, French, or both, though some have also enabled people to participate in Indigenous languages.\n#10: What support could be provided to participants in an inquiry including survivors and the families of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls? \nGiven that a Commission has the discretion to hire any staff it may require, and because it has the power to design its own process, it could ensure that support is provided to survivors, families, and others.\n#11: Can an inquiry integrate ceremony? \nYes. As a Commission has the discretion to create its own process, it has the authority to integrate ceremony.\n#12: Who leads an inquiry? And how are they chosen? \nThe Inquiries Act requires the Cabinet to appoint the Commissioners who will lead an inquiry. The Act specifies that Cabinet has the discretion to appoint one or several Commissioners (s3).\n\nIn the past, Commissioners have tended to be retired judges, Attorneys General, or academics.\nHowever, Commissioners may be any person or persons whom the Cabinet determines has qualifications to lead a particular inquiry, and appointing a retired judge does not in and of itself does ensure an inquiry\u2019s independence.\nExamples of Commissioners who have been appointed for other inquiries include Justice Sidney Lindon who led the Ipperwash Inquiry, while the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples was co-chaired by George Erasmus a former national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, and Justice Ren\u00e9 Dussault from the Qu\u00e9bec Appeal Court, with Viola Robinson, former president of the Native Council of Canada; Mary Sillett, former president of the national Inuit women\u2019s association Pauktuutit and of the Inuit Tapirisat Canada; Paul Chartrand, a M\u00e9tis lawyer and head of the Department of Native Studies at the University of Manitoba; Justice Bertha Wilson, former justice of the Supreme Court of Canada; and Allan Blakeney, former premier of Saskatchewan.\n\n#13: What powers do Commissioners have?\nCommissioners have quite extensive investigative powers.\n\nThey are able to summon any witnesses to give evidence in person or in writing, or provide documents requested by the Commission (s4 Inquiries Act).\nCommissioners\u2019 power to enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give evidence is equal to that of courts in civil cases (s5 Inquiries Act).\nCommissioners have the statutory authority to hire administrative, legal, research, and investigative staff as well as recognized experts to assist the Commission in its tasks.\nCommissioners also have the discretion to hire whoever else they deem necessary (s11 Inquiries Act). This can include interpreters and support workers.\n\n#14: Where can an inquiry take place?\nCommissions have the discretion to hold meetings in and visit different parts of the country.\n#15: Can there be regional or provincial branches of an inquiry?\nWhile some provinces have their own legislation allowing their governments to establish provincial Commissions of Inquiry, these inquiries would only be able to examine agencies and issues that fall under their provincial jurisdiction. Although, it is worth noting that Ontario\u2019s Public Inquiries Act permits the province to partner with the federal government in a joint public inquiry (s4). This section would allow a future national Commission of Inquiry to address provincial agencies and issues in Ontario.\n\nThe fact that a national Commission of Inquiry is federally established does not legally preclude provinces from engaging in the process. To date, all provinces have publicly expressed support for a national inquiry into violence against Indigenous women and girls. This may indicate some willingness by the provinces to collaborate and assist with a future national inquiry.\nFurther, as a national body, a federally established Commission of Inquiry is in a perfect position to address issues of interprovincial coordination and cooperation as well as coordination (or lack thereof) between the provinces and the federal government. This is significant in the context of violence against Indigenous women because the failure to provide\u00a0co-ordination between different jurisdictions of the State has been identified by the United Nations inquiry report on murders and disappearances as a violation of the rights of Indigenous women in Canada. (This issue was also identified by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in its 2015 report, a 2013 Human Rights Watch report, a 2011 report by the SisterWatch program\u00a0with the Vancouver Police Services, and a 2010 report by the Federal Provincial Territorial Coordinating Committee of Senior Officials on Criminal Justice. For more information on this issue please see this past LSC report).\n\n#16: What is the possible scope of an Inquiry?\nWhen Cabinet establishes a public inquiry, it must also specify the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference. These terms of reference delineate the scope of an inquiry.\n\nThey generally specify: who the Commissioner(s) will be, the mandate or purpose of the inquiry, and the powers the Commission will have.\nThese terms of reference can also set the duration of an inquiry and any other specifications or guidelines Cabinet may want to include. Former Supreme Court of Canada Chief Justice Brian Dickson engaged in a pre-inquiry process to determine the terms of reference for the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. This pre-inquiry process is a good mechanism for ensuring consultation that will assist a government with developing strong terms of reference.\nPublic inquiries can investigate and study facts and statistics as well as policies and broader systemic issues. As will be discussed in the five sub-questions below, both facts and their broader historical, social, and legal contexts are equally important.\nAn inquiry can be well-equipped to study these things in an effective and helpful way. \u00a0Can an inquiry develop a clearer idea of the statistics of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls? Yes. Data collection and analysis is often a critical part of public inquiries. All inquiries are required to examine what is known, identify gaps in knowledge, and attempt to fill these gaps.\nGaining an understanding, and contributing to the public understanding, of an issue is an important cornerstone of any effective inquiry. Further, the databases and other resources prepared during a Commission\u2019s activities can be a very useful public resource if independently maintained after the inquiry ends.\nAn example of this can is the Krever Inquiry, which was established to examine the tainted blood supply in Canada. The inquiry\u2019s work and data collection ultimately led to the establishment of the Canadian Blood Services, an independent agency that continues to administer the country\u2019s national blood bank. As such, these resources produced during the inquiry process continue to be an important living document for the public.\nThe independent collection, ongoing management, and public reporting of data is an especially important issue in the context of violence against Indigenous women and girls in Canada. Over the course of many years, collection, analysis, and public release of statistics and other data has been uneven and insufficient. This has deprived families, communities, Indigenous peoples\u2019 organizations, and the public of an accurate, comprehensive, accessible, and up-to-date statistical picture of disappearances and murders.\nThe Sisters in Spirit database of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, which was in the process of addressing these issues, was defunded by the federal government in 2010. The RCMP have not been transparent with their data on this issue.\nSeveral grassroots databases have been initiated across the country that would benefit from being better resourced, more coordinated, integrated, and standardized.\n\nCan an inquiry examine the root causes of violence against Indigenous women and girls?\nYes. The majority of the literature on the subject of violence against Indigenous women and girls is unanimous about its historical, sociological, and legal root causes. The 2015 Inter-American Commission on Human Rights report on missing and murdered Indigenous women in British Columbia discussed the systemic and sociological factors responsible for the disproportionate violence faced by Indigenous women in the province. It explained that the disappearances and murders of Indigenous women in Canada are part of a broader pattern of violence and discrimination against these women throughout the country (p11). The report also noted systemic failures in policing, as well as the legacies of Canadian colonization and the persistence of discriminatory laws such as the Indian Act were responsible for the violence (p12).\nThe 2015 United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) report confirmed the broad systemic causes for violence against Indigenous women in Canada. These included the social and economic marginalization of Indigenous women in Canada, failures by the police to promptly and thoroughly investigate instances of violence against Indigenous women, and the reluctance of the federal government to take immediate and effective state action (p3).\nCan an inquiry examine government policies, laws, and practices?\nYes. A national Commission of Inquiry will be able to examine existing laws and policies, as well as the legacies of past laws and policies. A Commission will also have the authority to examine prevalent practices within government agencies that may not be explicitly required by law (and/or may be inconsistent with the law).\nCan an inquiry examine RCMP policies and conduct? \nYes. A national Commission of Inquiry will be able to investigate and examine systemic issues within the RCMP that relate to violence against Indigenous women and girls, including RCMP policies and the conduct of RCMP officers.\nCan an inquiry examine individual cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls? \nIt is important for the future inquiry to ensure that all investigations of missing and murdered women are thorough and unbiased. It is also important to review cases in a way that highlights both positive practices where they exist, as well as system failings that need to be addressed. If this is consistent with the Commission of Inquiry\u2019s terms of reference, it may be possible for it to examine individual cases.\nHowever, given the high volume of implicated cases, individual case reviews for all past cases may not be feasible. More importantly, a public inquiry may not be the most helpful or advantageous way to review individual cases. Rather, an independent civilian investigation unit whose sole purpose and focus is to investigate individual cases may be appropriate. Such a unit could liaise with the Commission but its mandate could extend beyond the life of the Commission. Ultimately, it will be important to ensure that any inquiry or civilian investigation unit reviewing individual cases is independent from government and accountable.\n#17: How can an inquiry ensure it does not merely duplicate what has been done already by other inquests and inquiries?\nWhen setting the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference and determining its scope and tasks, preliminary research and consultation will be required to determine where knowledge gaps exists and how the Commission may be able to fill these gaps. This preliminary research will also be helpful in identifying steps that governments can take right away, without waiting for the results of the inquiry. For a more detailed description and discussion of the findings of past inquiries and reports, as well as a discussion of areas that still require further research and study, please see past work by the Legal Strategy Coalition on Violence Against Indigenous Women.\n#18: How is the independence of an inquiry ensured?\nThe independence of past Commissions of Inquiry has generally been protected by ensuring that they are established at arm\u2019s length from government. Practically speaking, this would require the Commission to have control over its own budget, structure, and other administrative decisions. In addition, the Commissioners must be seen to be independent, that is, not subject to guidance or direction from government once its initial terms of reference have been provided. It is also important that the Commissioners should not have been part of any past government or agency whose conduct will be examined.\n#19: Are there any mechanisms to ensure a Commission\u2019s accountability in the process and outcome of an inquiry?\nYes. The more proceedings are made open and accessible to the public, the more accountable and transparent the Commission will be perceived to be.\n\nEncouraging public scrutiny and media access can also help to ensure accountability.\nIt is worth noting that the ultimate findings of a public inquiry are judicially reviewable by the Federal Court. This means that an individual can apply to the Federal Court to review a Commission\u2019s decisions if it is believed that the decisions included factual or legal errors, failed to follow established procedures, or failed to conform to the scope of the Commission\u2019s mandate.\nJudicial review can help to ensure a Commission\u2019s accountability.\n\n#20: When the inquiry provides recommendations, is there a way to guarantee that these recommendations are implemented?\nThere is no statutory duty to implement the recommendations of a national Commission of Inquiry.\n\nHowever, it is possible to take measures to improve the likelihood of recommendations being implemented. For example, eight years after the release of the final report of the Manitoba Aboriginal Justice Inquiry, the Manitoba government established the Aboriginal Justice Implementation Commission.\nThis Commission was tasked with reviewing the original inquiry recommendations, assessing the extent to which they were implemented, and ultimately directing how they could best be implemented more effectively. What is included in the Commission\u2019s mandate regarding expected outcomes will matter, as will public attention to ensuring that the Commission\u2019s work is orientated towards producing action and concrete measurable change.\n\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\n\nTags: Carolyn Bennett, families of missing and murdered Indigenous women, Featured, Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, mmiw, national inquiry\n\n\n\nAPTN National News\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tView all posts by APTN National News \u2192 \n\n\n\n\nAlberta First Nation\u2019s literacy program makes reading fun for kids on summer break by mixing in games\nNumber of students applying for unique Cree camp experience skyrocketing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch for:\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Posts\n\n\n\u2018I\u2019m much stronger now\u2019 Hunter Tootoo tells gathering in Iqaluit after 2 month absence \n#MMIW Inquiry details to be announced Wednesday in Gatineau, Que \n#MMIWG: What a National Inquiry can and cannot do \nBlack Tickle residents facing clinic cuts hold protest, demand healthcare from visiting government officials \nPok\u00e9mon Go craze catches on even in Internet-challenged Iqaluit \nBlack Tickle wants Liberals to follow through on land claim promise as community fights for basic services \nNumber of students applying for unique Cree camp experience skyrocketing \nFirst Nations downstream of Saskatchewan pipeline leak brace for worst as oil, chemicals flow through river \nMcGill involves students, public in dig for historic artifacts along St. Lawrence River \nEdmonton\u2019s first Indigenous artist in residence will travel to find inspiration from area First Nations, M\u00e9tis \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t@APTNNews on Twitter\n\t\t \n\n\nTweets by @APTNNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#MMIW Inquiry details to be announced Wednesday in Gatineau, Que\n\n\n\n2 hours ago\n\n\nNational News \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamilies arrive, groups gearing up for government announcement on inquiry\n\n\n\n3 hours ago\n\n\nNational News \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroups in B.C upset with feds for issuing Site C dam permits\n\n\n\n7 hours ago\n\n\nNational News \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of students applying for unique Cree camp experience skyrocketing\n\n\n\n23 hours ago\n\n\nNational News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPages \nAbout APTN InFocus\nAbout APTN Investigates\nAbout APTN National News\nAbout Face to Face\nAbout Nation to Nation\nAbout The Laughing Drum\nAPTN Investigates Full Episodes\nConnie Oakes\nLive Stream\nNewscasts\nSend Your Comments\n\n \n\n Recent Stories \n\n#MMIW Inquiry details to be announced Wednesday in Gatineau, Que\n\n\nFamilies arrive, groups gearing up for government announcement on inquiry\n\n\nGroups in B.C upset with feds for issuing Site C dam permits\n\n\nNumber of students applying for unique Cree camp experience skyrocketing\n\n\n#MMIWG: What a National Inquiry can and cannot do\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Links\nHome\nSchedule\nShows\nFull Episodes\n\n\n\n\nAPTN Programs\nAPTN National News\nAPTN InFocus\nAPTN Investigates\nAPTN Movies\nAPTN Kids\n\n\n\nFind us on\n\n     \n\n\n\n\nConnect With APTN\nAPTN Insiders\nWebstage Pass\nCommunity Cam\nContact Us\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate Home\nProducers\nCareers\n\nAdvertise With Us\nAPTNCSR.com\nCommunity Connections\nAPTNPress.com\nMedia Releases\n\n\n\n\nAPTN @ 2015.

Their stories about their mothers, daughters, aunties and cousins who had tragically gone missing or were murdered were heartwrenching ... It's because of these courageous women and families who knew something was very wrong that we are here today.\" \u2014 Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett.___\"The big houses behind me ... represent the strength and resilience of the human spirit, the strength of indigenous peoples and it is that strength, the culture, the traditions and our languages that are going to assist in healing, that are going to chart a new path to the future where indigenous peoples can finally see their face in the mirror of our Constitution.\" \u2014 Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.___\"Canada's colonial history altered indigenous communities and families and the racism brought on by colonization has had devastating impacts on indigenous women's power, their status, their role in their communities and their economic situations. This intersection of racism and sexism greatly increases the vulnerability of indigenous women and girls to experience violence. Changing these attitudes and practices will require a steady and an honest gaze.\" \u2014 Status of Women Minister Patricia Hajdu.___\"The spirits of the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls will be close in our hearts and in our minds as we do our work. The families and the survivors' losses, pain, strength and courage will inspire our work.\" \u2014 chief commissioner Marion Buller.___\"We have arrived at a new beginning: an inquiry that we hope will help us end the violence that indigenous women and girls face every day of their lives.\" \u2014 Dawn Lavell-Harvard, president of the Native Women's Association of Canada.___\"There's racism, there's discrimination, there's misogyny, there's genocide, there's colonization, there's oppression and there's also exploitation of women and that has to stop. Because the simple message to everyone is this: indigenous lives matter. Indigenous women and girls, their lives are important. Their lives matter and they're not any less than anybody else.\" \u2014 National Chief Perry Bellegarde, Assembly of First Nations.___\"It is high time that the embarrassment and shame that we carry gets addressed through this inquiry.\" \u2014 Melanie Omeniho, president of Women of the Metis Nation.___\"For this inquiry to be meaningful to Inuit, it must be led by indigenous women, including an Inuk woman. This is to me a fundamental matter of principle, equality and trust.\" \u2014 Rebecca Kudloo, president of Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada.___\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2016 Prince George Citizen\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail to a Friend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Email Address: *\n\n\nYour Name: *\n\n\nTo Email Address: *\n\n\nMessage: *\n\n\n\n* Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext\nUnemployment rate 7.7 per cent last month\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up For Our e-Newsletter!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCity Matters\n\nYour City Matters - City of Prince George\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Citizen\n\n\n\nMost Read\nMost Recent\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLocal linen business in lather as city awards contract to American outfit\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSevere thunderstorm watch\n\nAugust 5, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNorth facing physiotherapy shortage\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHighway reopened following collision\n\nAugust 5, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCanfor hosting free breakfast on Saturday\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nProvince has no \u0091Plan B\u0092 if LNG development fails\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLocal woman featured in Maclean's Canada's Stories\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNess Lake and a community in conversation\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLawsuit filed over collision with dead moose at accident scene\n\nAugust 3, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHard-hit town facing gas utility increases\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nUnemployment rate 7.7 per cent last month\n\nAugust 5, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSevere thunderstorm watch\n\nAugust 5, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHighway reopened following collision\n\nAugust 5, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNorthern Capitals\u0092 auditions begin today\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nJobs up for grabs at Cariboo Cats' camp\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPGARA pioneer passes away\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFinns finish Paciejewski\u0092s playoff run in Budapest\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHot pitcher knocks Knights out of the saddle\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEntrapment ineptitude\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRetire the rings\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill & Kate POLL\nPrince William and his wife Kate will be visiting B.C. this fall.

It also reflects the sustained advocacy and leadership of the Native Women's Association of Canada, the Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action, and other indigenous and women's rights advocates.\"It's because of these courageous women and families, who knew something was very wrong, that we are here today\", Bennett said during a press conference at the Canadian Museum of History near Ottawa.A National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls will get underway next month. Numerous cases went cold for decades. These commissioners, headed by Marion Buller who, in 1994 became the first Indigenous woman appointed to B.C.'s provincial court bench, will have a budget of $53.8 million when they launch their new national probe on September 1st.While they will be able to compel witnesses during their work, as stipulated in the Inquiries Act, they will not be able to force governments to comply with their findings.We know why our women are being killed.Predictable criticism has risen from some quarters about the inquiry price tag that's now pegged at almost $54 million, up from the original estimate of $40 million, with another $16 million over four years to establish family liaison units to ensure families remain connected to the inquiry process and to provide them with needed services.\"We can not move forward until we face and recognise and put a stop to this ongoing tragedy\".She says it's not an indigenous problem, but a Canadian one.Aboriginal women in Canada experience violence 3.5 times more than non-aboriginal women, and they are five times more likely to die violently than other women.Advocacy group the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC) noted that it has been calling for such an inquiry for over a decade as it praised the latest news.A year later, it said 32 aboriginal women had been murdered and 11 more disappeared since it first reported on the issue. The federal government disclosed Wednesday the commission will need more money to fulfil its mandate.\"Families are not looking for mainstream counselling services through victim services, but justice\", the women's centre said.\"How well the inquiry can actually serve that goal is going to depend to a large degree on the co-operation that it receives from the provincial and territorial governments, from policing services - and questions remain about that\".Some activists are concerned about the fact that the inquiry won't allow for closed cases to be reopened, the CBC says.\"Systems that are broken need to be fixed\", Bellegarde said. Farther, in doing little to unpack Canada's colonial legacy, which is embedded in the country's institutions, the \"focus is on healing and reconciliation, which downplays uncomfortable truths and hard decisions (that are required) to make change\".\n \n\n\n\n\nOther reports by MyHealthBowl \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06 August 2016\n\n\n\n\nLuis Suarez relishing Liverpool FC reunion in Barcelona clash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05 August 2016\n\n\n\n\nTurkey to Hire 20000 Teachers Following Coup Attempt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05 August 2016\n\n\n\n\nTexas reaches deal to weaken voter-ID rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06 August 2016\n\n\n\n\nTrump won't endorse Ryan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06 August 2016\n\n\n\n\nSome Olympic doping bans 'unenforceable,' court says\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05 August 2016\n\n\n\n\n19-Year-Old Teacher Abducted And Gang Raped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Service Members Have Gotten Zika\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05 August 2016\n\n\n\n\nFirst GOP Congressman Dumps Trump; Clinton Gets Convention Bounce05:48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05 August 2016\n\n\n\n\nNew York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton Resigns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05 August 2016\n\n\n\n\nTrump Support Is Collapsing Nationwide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05 August 2016\n\n\n\n\nSoria blows lead in the eighth inning as Royals split with Rays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n05 August 2016\n\n\n\n\nLt Guv wins battle for Delhi : AAP Govt to move SC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent News Articles\n\n\n \nReady or not, Pokemon Go comes to the Rio Olympics\n\n\n\n\n \nPence is Endorsing Ryan, so Will Trump Come Around?\n\n\n\n\n \nBarack Obama hits back at Donald Trump, calls his claims as 'ridiculous'\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss This Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MOST POPULAR MyHealthBowl\n\n\n\n\nIdaho fire grows, burns state-operated structure\n\n\n\nHamilton Wins German F1 GP, Claims 4th Race In A Row\n\n\n\nObama warns of IS-inspire lone wolf attacks\n\n\n\n'The Devil' Wears Pantsuits: Donald Trump Steps Up Attacks on Hillary Clinton\n\n\n\nTax free weekend kicks off Friday, August 5th\n\n\nPokemon GO Devs Respond To The Community's Outrage\n\n\n\nLewis Hamilton WINS the German Grand Prix as Rosberg finishes fourth\n\n\nClinton Accuses Russia Of DNC Hacking\n\n\n\nUSA  women's soccer team blanks New Zealand\n\n\n\nApple iPhone 7 specs leak indicate 3GB of RAM instead of 2GB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOLLOW OUR NEWSPAPER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLATES NEWS MyHealthBowl\n\n\n\n \nUSOC chairman calls for unity to fix broken anti-doping system\n\n\nIndia asks its diplomats to withdraw kids from Pakistani schools\n\n\nANC already in coalition talks\n\n\n19 stabbed, killed at Japanese disabled facility, attacker turns himself in\n\n\nTaliban attacks kill two dozen Afghan police officers in Helmand\n\n\nKuwait: Hadi coaxed back in to Yemen talks\n\n\nUSA government licenses first company to land on the moon\n\n\nFather Arrested After Twin Babies Die In Hot Car\n\n\nCuttack: Bus driver, conductor held for rape and murder of teenage girl\n\n\nLabour leadership: MP 'unresigns' from Corbyn team\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOTHER NEWS\n\n\nTechnology\nArts&Culture\nMarkets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn top of that, there is already the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge that are no...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHilsenteger discovered the new iPhone 7 Plus is a tiny bit slimmer, us...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArmy captain Humayun Khan was killed by a suicide bomber in Iraq in 20...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJason Hammel  (10-5) allowed one run and five hits while striking out ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew York Yankees first baseman Mark Teixeira  is retiring at the end t...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr maybe not: \"I don't, I don't throw shade\", Carey apparently said at...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Warner  pledged about $583 million for its piece, which values Hu...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe  Jaguar  then collides head-on with another police vehicle and a p...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has sold more than 680,000 copies in its first three days alone, be...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've seen this ability in spell form, used by Professor Snape on  Har...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn another defection Monday, top Jeb Bush adviser Sally Bradshaw said ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it's still a victory for a nation that the independent World Anti-...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverseas, European equities also increased broadly Friday.

Oppal says it's vital for the incoming Liberal government to strike the right tone and clearly define the terms for its own long-sought and long-awaited inquiry. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck \n\nPickton, one of Canada's most notorious serial killers, was convicted in 2007 of the murders of six women and charged in the deaths of 20 others.\nThe incoming Liberal government needs to first determine what kind of an inquiry it wants to conduct in order to ensure that it is proactive, Oppal said in an interview.\n\"I would think that if you're going to have an inquiry, you don't need to have one of the type that we had, where the police were cross-examined for endless days because one of our tasks was to find out what the police did wrong during the Pickton years,\" he said.\n\"I think if they're going to have one, they should have an inquiry that goes to the various communities and the centres, a commissioner or group of commissioners, to get the voice of the communities.\n\"It never hurts to talk to the communities to get their views and to bring them on side.\"\nDawn Lavell Harvard, president of the Native Women Women's Association of Canada, said it's crucial that the first stage of the inquiry include consulting with both grassroots groups and the families of victims.\n\"We have laid the ground work,\" she said. \"We have been fighting for this. We have been working on this. Our women have the expertise and the knowledge that's required here so they need to be driving that process.\"\nOjibway activist Joan Jack, a retired lawyer who previously ran to become national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said it would be a very respectful gesture for prime minister-designate Justin Trudeau to sit down with families.\n\"The families that have lost loved ones represent us all,\" Jack said. \"As First Nations people, as indigenous people, we are very connected and when somebody is hurt, we are all hurt.\"\nJack also said she hopes there will be an examination of violence inside and outside of indigenous communities. \"We can't just point outside our community and not also take a good hard look at ourselves.\"\nIn their election platform, the Liberals committed to \"immediately\" launch a national public inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls in Canada.\nThe party said it would seek recommendations for governments, law enforcement and others to help \"solve these crimes and prevent future ones.\" It also promised to spend $40 million on the study over two years.\nOppal said it will be important for the government to spend wisely.\n\"You could not have the type of inquiry that we had, where we had witnesses being called and being examined, you couldn't do that for $40 million across the country,\" he said. \"The moment you announce a national inquiry, the lawyers are going to line up. So you have to be careful as to how you're going to spend the money.\"\nOppal also said the Grits should take previous inquiries into account to ensure the new investigation does not cover old ground.\n\"It is no great mystery as to what is causing all of this,\" he said. \"It's poverty, drug addiction, it's mental illness ... homelessness and the general standards of living on reserves that cause aboriginal women to come into the urban centres.\"\nThe former commissioner said now is the time to examine prevention and policies, including community resources available to help indigenous women and what more needs to be done.\nFollow @kkirkup on Twitter \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\nReport Error\nSubmit a Tip\nRefundRefund\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou can comment on most stories on winnipegfreepress.com.

Family and friends of Tina Fontaine are remembering her five years after her death. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Kelly MaloneWINNIPEG  \u2013  On a recent warm evening in Winnipeg a woman ran up to the Bear Clan Patrol in a panic asking for help to find her niece who had not returned home.\nPatrol co-ordinator Melissa Stevenson says within minutes more than a dozen searchers wearing bright-yellow vests scoured the area, calling out the girl\u2019s name until she was found on a nearby street.\nThe child\u2019s face, Stevenson says, was small, innocent and full of potential. Stevenson almost cried because of how much the girl reminded her of 15-year-old Tina Fontaine.\n\u201cThat potential for greatness will never be. We will just never know what Tina could be,\u201d Stevenson says with tears running down her cheeks.\nSaturday marks five years since Tina\u2019s 72-pound body, wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down by rocks, was found in the Red River in Winnipeg.\nStevenson knew Tina as a child and is still connected with her siblings and cousins. For the last four years, she says, the close-knit group has met almost every month to try to come to terms with the killings of too many of their family members and to find a way to heal.\nStevenson was just starting out as a social worker when she met Tina, her sister and her cousins at the Indigenous Family Centre. Tina was very young, but she was full of love, laughter and life, Stevenson recalls with a smile.\nIt was a safe place and the smell of Tina\u2019s grandmother\u2019s famous soup would waft from the kitchen. But tragedy would strike repeatedly outside the centre\u2019s walls. Four of the dozen or so young relatives were violently killed.\nIn 2007, the body of Fonessa Bruyere, 17, was found with multiple stab wounds on the outskirts of Winnipeg. Her murder is still unsolved. In 2011, 15-year-old Clark Stevenson was stabbed to death by another youth.\nTina\u2019s body was found in 2014. Raymond Cormier was acquitted in her death last year.\nIn 2017, Jeanenne Fontaine was shot dead and her home lit on fire. Three men have been convicted in her killing.\n\u201cThey were all young. They were all beautiful. They all got hurt in a very violent way,\u201d Stevenson says.\n\u201cWhen we come together, we pray for safety. We pray for justice. We pray just to keep hanging on.\u201d\nLast year the relatives, who are now all adults, held a special potluck to release Tina\u2019s spirit. This year, they hope to work on their own healing journey.\nThere will also be private mourning on the Sagkeeng First Nation in the house where Tina spent much of her childhood being raised by her great-aunt Thelma Favel.\n\u201cIt\u2019s another year without her in it, and a daily thing for us to kind of absorb that she\u2019s never ever coming back. It hurts just as bad,\u201d Favel says.\nFavel and her family will reflect on Tina\u2019s funny stories, big dreams and easy-going attitude. She says every memory of Tina is a favourite one.\n\u201cI just wish I was able to live all those things with her again.\u201d\nTina was stolen too soon, Favel says, but her legacy has made lasting change.\nThe discovery of Tina\u2019s body renewed calls for a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and revived the volunteer Bear Clan Patrol.\nAn extensive report released in March by Manitoba\u2019s children\u2019s advocate included five recommendations touching on justice, education, mental health and child welfare.\nThe Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs created the First Nations Family Advocate Office. A 24-hour safe space for Winnipeg youth was dedicated in Tina\u2019s memory last May.\n\u201cTina\u2019s dream was always to help kids and people and I think she\u2019s doing it,\u201d Favel says. \u201cShe\u2019s not letting this rest.\u201d\nShare this story:\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n\n Twitter\n Facebook\n Instagram\n YouTube\n Tumblr\n\n\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nArchive\n \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nThe Medicine Hat News\nOther Publications\n Contact\nCareers\n \n\n\nContact the Medicine Hat News\n\n3257 Dunmore Rd SE\n\t\t\t\t\tMedicine Hat, AB T1B 3R2\n[P] 403.527.1101\n[F] 403.528.5696\n\n\nContact\nCareers\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrint Advertising: 403.528.5659\n\t\t\t\t\tNational Advertising: 403.528.5766\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Advertising: 403.528.5698\n\t\t\t\t\tClassifieds: 403.526.7653\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2019 The Medicine Hat News, A Division of Continental Newspapers Canada Ltd.\nTerms and Conditions & Privacy policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Here\u2019s what that would requireBy Alyshah Hasham, Jacques Gallant, Wendy Gillis, Jim Rankin and Betsy PowellWed., June 5, 2019The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls report lays out in undeniable detail how Indigenous women and girls have been discriminated against, harmed by and failed throughout the criminal justice system. The report\u2019s 231 calls for justice \u2014 many of which have been advocated for previously in past reviews and reports \u2014 are now in the hands of governments, police forces, and other institutions.Advocates say the focus now must be on actually making changes, and holding institutions accountable for failing to do so. What might that take? Some of the recommendations require new funding to establish or expand already existing measures such as access to Indigenous sentencing reports, legal support and victim services. Others, such as instituting harsher sentences for violence against Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA people (two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, queer, questioning, intersex and asexual), require changes to the Criminal Code.Criminal justice reforms alone, especially those addressing the trauma and aftermath of violence including punitive sentencing measures, do not address the root causes of the violence and racism experienced by Indigenous women and girls across the country for generations, said Kim Stanton, a lawyer who practises Aboriginal law at Goldblatt Partners in Toronto. The report also calls for public transit to remote communities, a guaranteed annual livable income for all Canadians, child welfare reform and safe housing and clean water for all Indigenous communities. The recommendations must be viewed as a whole if they are to make a meaningful impact, she said. \u201cEven at the most basic level we need to be paying attention to the lack of services that make it possible for Indigenous women not to be victimized in the first place,\u201d she said.ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOWOne key recommendation, Stanton said, is the report\u2019s call for a national ombudsperson and tribunal that would evaluate government services to ensure compliance with human and Indigenous rights laws. Stanton said this office could shine a light on the progress or lack thereof governments and institutions are making.\u201cWithout accountability measures, these things tend to fade,\u201d she said. \u201cEnsuring accountability will be critical to achieving any change.\u201d Here are some of the changes to the criminal justice system the report calls for, and how likely they are to be implemented:You can read the full report on the inquiry\u2019s website.

It has been an effective way of helping women, including Indigenous women, feel more comfortable accessing the justice system and making statements to police, said Deepa Mattoo, the executive director of the Barbra Schlifer legal clinic, which has been involved in the pilot program.Expanding the program in a way that ensures the cultural and geographic needs of Indigenous women and girls are met should be done with the leadership of Indigenous communities, Mattoo said. \u201cWe have a baseline to work from and it is a legal framework in which access to justice can be provided,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to reinvent the wheel.\u201d However, the recommendation comes about two months after the Ontario government went in the opposite direction and slash funding at Legal Aid Ontario by 30 per cent. \u201cWith a 30 per cent cut I am not hopeful that this particular recommendation will be implemented here,\u201d said Kim Stanton.\u201cThere has been such a long-standing crisis in legal aid funding and this recent set of cuts has just exacerbated it,\u201d she said. \u201cI would hope that there would be a reconsideration of those cuts in light of this recommendation.\u201dIncreasing Indigenous representation at all levels of the judiciary, including the Supreme CourtThis change would bring important perspectives to court cases, legal experts say.\u201cI don\u2019t know the numbers (of Indigenous judges) but I would say that it\u2019s very low and I\u2019d say it\u2019s been recognized for a long time that systems, such as health care, education, and justice, be responsive and reflective of the communities they serve, that that\u2019s a positive and it helps people feel that they are represented,\u201d said Emily Hill, interim legal advocacy director at Aboriginal Legal Services in Toronto.There\u2019s a growing recognition that Indigenous lawyers and scholars would bring strong insights to the role of judge, \u201cparticularly when we know that a disproportionate number of Indigenous people come before judges for bail hearings, trials, sentencings and as victims. \u201cTheir perspectives could add to the wisdom of the court.\u201dNeither the Ontario Court of Justice nor the Superior Court of Justice were able to tell the Star how many Indigenous judges preside over cases as they don\u2019t keep those kinds of statistics.According to the most recent annual report available online from the provincial judicial appointments advisory committee, which is from 2014, only 2 per cent of the court\u2019s then-complement of judges were categorized as \u201cFirst Nations,\u201d a total of eight.The Office of the Federal Commissioner of Judicial Affairs said it is \u201cnot in a position to advise\u201d the Star on how many 1,207 federally-appointed judges (including part-time judges) across the country are Indigenous.Following changes to the federal judicial appointment process in 2016 by the Liberal government in a bid to increase diversity on the bench, applicants were given the option to self-identify. Between October 2017 and October 2018, there were 10 applications from Indigenous candidates for a judicial position and 23 applications from Indigenous candidates (including from previous years) were assessed by independent judicial advisory committees for the federal justice minister\u2019s approval. Three Indigenous candidates ended up being appointed.Making murder cases with a pattern of intimate-partner violence and abuse count as first-degree murderThere are several circumstances where a murder is considered to automatically be first-degree murder without requiring planning and deliberation, including when the victim is a police officer, if the murder took place during a hijacking, sexual assault, kidnapping or terrorist activity or if the murder took place for the benefit of a criminal organization. The sentence for first-degree murder is automatically life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years. Mattoo said the change could help address the historic leniency in sentencing in intimate-partner homicides. However, any changes that could result in harsher sentencing will need to be carefully reviewed in the context of over-incarceration and over-policing of Indigenous and racialized people in general, said Stanton. Indigenous women are disproportionately targeted by non-Indigenous men, but they also experience abuse in their own communities, she said.\u201cPunitive measures should be less of a focus than addressing the root causes of the violence,\u201d Stanton said. Deterrence through punitive measures is not proven to be effective and much of the violence and abuse experienced by Indigenous women and girls stems from systemic factors, she said.Expanded use of Gladue reports and sentencing principlesGladue reports detail an Indigenous offender\u2019s background and are submitted to courts during the sentencing hearings. The reports can be used by judges when considering alternatives to jail or a reduction in the length of sentence.Jonathan Rudin, program director at Aboriginal Legal Services, supports the call because Gladue reports, seen as a provincial responsibility, are not universally used across Canada. Basically, there are no Gladue reports available in Newfoundland, Labrador, New Brunswick, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Northwest Territories and Nunavut.There is more access to Gladue reports in Ontario than pretty much anywhere else in Canada due to the fact the Ministry of the Attorney General and Legal Aid Ontario provide funding, he said.\u201cWhat Ontario does provide for other provinces and territories is a great model for how this can be done,\u201d Rudin said. The Toronto-based Aboriginal Legal Services was the first agency that started doing Gladue reports and has 30 staff working on Gladue issues, preparing about 500 reports and letters a year.Rudin said they make a difference. \u201cThe sentencing process has been described as a sausage factory, you\u2019re just moving people through in this line. Unless people have information that speaks to the life experience of the person before them ... those things don\u2019t get considered.\u201dAmending Criminal Code to make violence against Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA people a factor at sentencingThe change would allow a judge to consider a harsher sentence for crimes involving Indigenous victims \u2014 like they already can in crimes with established aggravating factors like hate motivation, abuse of trust or terrorism. However, on a case-by-case basis it will be difficult to prove in court that a victim\u2019s identity was a factor in the crime, Rudin said. \u201cYou would have to prove an individual knew that the victim was Indigenous. I can see this opening up a hornet\u2019s nest.\u201cWe also need to consider sometimes violence against Indigenous women and girls is perpetrated by other Indigenous women and girls for all sorts of reasons. I don\u2019t know if we want to be automatically moving to that criminalizing that behaviour even more.\u201dAs well, while violence against Indigenous women and girls is an issue, so is violence against women in general, he said.\u201cI think people might think \u2018why should the sentence that someone receives for sexually assaulting an Indigenous woman be different than the sentence the same person receives for the same activity where the victim is non Indigenous?\u2019\u201d he said.He doubts such a measure would withstand a constitutional challenge.Corrections reform, including more \u2018non-jail\u2019 facilitiesFor those who critique and study the Correctional Service of Canada, the inquiry\u2019s recommendations are nothing new \u2014 some date back several decades \u2014 but there is a feeling that, maybe now, some will get traction.Before the 1960s, Indigenous people made up 1 or 2 per cent of prison populations and that share has risen ever since, to the point where about a quarter of all federal inmates are Indigenous. They are the fastest growing prison population in Canada, despite the introduction of Indigenous programming.\u201cWhat I quite liked about it is the recommendations are focusing on decarceration strategies,\u201d said Vicki Chartrand, an associate professor in sociology at Bishop\u2019s University who specializes in penal policy and colonialism.The inquiry calls for CSC to take urgent action to create non-jail facilities to house women and girls, and to strategically locate them to allow for \u201clocalized placements and mother-and-child programming.\u201dCSC \u201cunderutilizes\u201d these already available options, Chartrand said. The inquiry calls for funding parity for these facilities in line with typical CSC-operated facilities.The inquiry also recommends the CSC create an office of the deputy commissioner for Indigenous issues, something the Office of the Correctional Investigator \u2014 the federal prisoners\u2019 ombudsperson \u2014 has been calling for more than a decade.Former correctional investigator Howard Sapers said CSC kept refusing, saying it would be too bureaucratic. (CSC already has deputy commissioners for women and health care.) \u201cIt makes no sense that such an important area of policy and programming and emphasis \u2014 as evidenced through the mandate letters that were given to the commissioners of correction over the last few years \u2014 that they wouldn\u2019t have a senior official responsible for the file,\u201d said Sapers. \u201cMaybe this time it will have traction.\u201dAnother \u201cback to the future\u201d moment Sapers found disappointing was a call to return to key women\u2019s correctional strategies set out in 1990. \u201cThat\u2019s how far things have strayed,\u201d said Sapers. Evaluate the impact of mandatory minimum sentencingThis recommendation follows one of the calls to action from the 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission report which urged the federal government to amend the Criminal Code so that judges could be given more discretion in crafting sentences for offenders by taking into account various factors including Indigenous identity. The federal Liberal government has not reined in mandatory minimums despite saying they would review them after coming to power in 2015. When the government proposed its massive bill to revamp the criminal justice system last year, the bill was silent on mandatory minimums, with then-justice minister Jody Wilson-Raybould saying the government was still looking into the issue.Independent Sen. Kim Pate took it upon herself to introduce a bill in the Senate that would allow judges to decide for themselves whether to impose the mandatory minimum, based on recommendations from past reports. That bill has been referred to the Senate\u2019s legal and constitutional affairs committee but may have to be introduced again after the fall election. Criminal defence lawyers have also been saying for years that action on mandatory minimums is long overdue.\u201cMandatory minimum sentences significantly and disproportionately impact racialized defendants including Indigenous women and more must be done to immediately address this systemic problem,\u201d said Michael Lacy, president of the Criminal Lawyers\u2019 Association.Establish \u2018robust and well-funded\u2019 Indigenous civilian police oversight bodiesIndigenous branches could be established within already existing \u201creputable civilian oversight bodies\u201d within a jurisdiction, the report suggests. These bodies would oversee investigations into alleged police negligence or misconduct, as well as cases involving Indigenous peoples.In his public consultations for his sweeping report on police oversight in Ontario, Court of Appeal Justice Michael Tulloch found that many Indigenous people felt targeted by the Ontario Provincial Police and municipal police officers in their communities. But they did not feel there was any recourse through a civilian police watchdog, such as the Office of the Independent Police Review Director; many didn\u2019t know it existed. Tulloch found that oversight bodies \u201chave chronically failed to engage with Indigenous communities\u201d \u2014 a fact that is \u201cespecially true in rural and northern communities.\u201d In an emailed statement, Brian Gray, a spokesperson for Ontario\u2019s ministry of the attorney general, cited the province\u2019s newly passed policing legislation, which impacts the Special Investigations Unit, the civilian agency that investigates police-related deaths, serious injuries or allegations of sexual assault. Under the new act, the SIU \u201cwould have authority to investigate First Nations police in jurisdictions where a First Nation police service board has been constituted.\u201d\u201cIn those situations, First Nations police would be subject to the same oversight as municipal police and the Ontario Provincial Police,\u201d Gray said.Gray added that the OIPRD, which will be renamed as the Law Enforcement Complaints Agency, will have a new mandate \u201cto oversee misconduct complaints for police officers employed by a First Nation board constituted under the statute,\u201d he said.Spokesperson Scott Bardsley said the federal Public Safety Ministry is reviewing the report, and noted that the RCMP are overseen by that Civilian Review and Complaints Commission, an independent agency that \u201censures that public complaints made about the conduct of RCMP members are examined fairly and impartially.\u201dCreating a national strategy to \u2018ensure consistency in reporting mechanisms\u2019 for missing Indigenous women and girlsThe report proposes this be led by the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the national organization that represents police leaders. Part of the goal would be to establish \u201cstandardized response times\u201d to reports of missing Indigenous persons and women and girls.Calling the national strategy \u201cimportant,\u201d the association said in a statement Monday that it was grateful for the national inquiry\u2019s trust on the issue. The organization said it was committed to studying the report and its recommendations, and to identify \u201chow it can assist police services across Canada with supports and education to aid in their understanding and implementation of the National Inquiry\u2019s recommendations.\u201d\u201cThe (association) remains committed to continuing to strengthen its relationships with the Indigenous community and Indigenous partners,\u201d it said in a statement. Mandatory training for all justice system professionals in Indigenous cultures and histories\u201cI certainly support mandatory training. I think we should be doing that right at the law school, or kindergarten,\u201d said Sen. Kim Pate. \u201cIt\u2019s that lack of awareness, the impact of colonization on Indigenous peoples, that has significantly contributed to racism.\u201d Pate is also in charge of scrutinizing Bill C-337, which would require judges to have mandatory training on sexual assault law. Pate supports the bill.The National Judicial Institute already provides some training on cultural competency \u201cand will undoubtedly reflect on what more they might do, recognizing that in keeping with principles of judicial independence, professional development must remain under the control and supervision of the judiciary,\u201d said Johanna Laporte, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Judicial Council. Ontario\u2019s Superior Court has, in partnership with the National Judicial Institute, undertaken programs to increase understanding of Indigenous cultures and histories, said court spokeswoman Norine Nathanson. \u201cJudicial education resources on Indigenous cultures, histories, and related case law and legislation have been developed by the court and are available to all judges. These resources are continually updated as new information and issues emerge,\u201d she said. Chief Justice Heather Smith also established an Indigenous judicial advisory committee in 2018. \u201cThe committee considers judicial education opportunities, increasing judicial engagement with Indigenous communities and stakeholders and other internal court policy matters related to Indigenous issues,\u201d Nathanson said. The Law Society of Ontario, which regulates the province\u2019s lawyers and paralegals, \u201capplauds\u201d the recommendation for enforced cultural competency standards, said spokeswoman Susan Tonkin, adding the regulator had been working on the issue for some time. For example, working in conjunction with its Indigenous advisory group, the law society released \u201cGuidelines for Lawyers Working with Indigenous Peoples\u201d in 2018, Tonkin said\u201cThe guidelines are a tool primarily to assist lawyers who act for Indigenous peoples and recognize the need for the law society to implement safeguards for Indigenous peoples engaged in legal processes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe law society also established Canada\u2019s first specialty certification in Indigenous legal issues in 2016, to properly articulate the Indigenous perspective and to effectively serve Indigenous clients.\u201dFunding police services in northern and remote Indigenous communitiesIndigenous communities must be served by forces that have, for example, officers with the necessary tools and experience when probing cases involving sexualized violence, including sexual assault kits, and knowledge of trauma-informed questioning, the report states. The Ministry of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness is carefully reviewing the report, spokesperson Scott Bardsley said Monday. He stated that the federal government has invested $291.2 million to go toward investments in equipment, salaries and additional officers, as well as $88.6 million in policing facilities. \u201cIn addition to its 48 per cent funding responsibility under the (First Nations Policing Program), the ministry offers a number of bilateral grant programs to support First Nation police services such as top-up funding to ensure wage parity,\u201d said provincial Ministry of the Solicitor General spokesperson Brent Ross.Ross also cited a new grant that will see First Nation police services receiving the same funding as last year.Calls for justice from the Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and GirlsView document on ScribdAlyshah Hasham is a Toronto-based reporter covering crime and court.

Gender Equality Minister Maryam Monsef says the federal government will fund more than 100 projects to \"honour the lives and legacies\" of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n OTTAWA \u2014 The federal government will fund more than 100 projects to \"honour the lives and legacies\" of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, Gender Equality Minister Maryam Monsef announced Monday.\n Funding for the commemorations will come from a $13-million fund Monsef unveiled in Winnipeg, though the limited range of recipients concerned the commissioners of the national inquiry who reported on the subject at the beginning of June.\n\n\n\n  article continues below\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\nGold mine gets go-ahead\nMMA fighter's friend sentenced on drug charges\nMan sentenced for drug house shoot out\nDemolition ordered for derelict motel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"Our government is listening to survivors and families who have told us that in order to move forward meaningfully, we must also pause to remember and honour those who are missing and whose lives have been lost,\" Monsef said in a statement.\n \"That is what we are doing by supporting these commemorative projects across Canada \u2014 ensuring that we will never forget our sisters in spirit and that we can prevent such tragedies in the future.\"\n\n Monsef said the approved projects include events, activities and creative works organized by First Nations, friendship centres and social-service agencies that help Indigenous people. Besides women and girls, they're supposed to honour the lives of LGBT and two-spirit people who've suffered similarly.\n Some examples:\n \u2014 One $493,000 project is to bring families together in 13 Inuit communities in Manitoba, Nunavut and Labrador to hold healing sewing circles and make red parkas to commemorate loved ones who are missing or known to have been murdered.\n \u2014 A $150,000 grant to the Victoria Native Friendship Centre will support performances in three cities of an opera, \"Missing,\" by Metis-Dene playwright Marie Clements.\n \u2014 A $200,000 project led by the Ontario Native Women's Association will see art exhibitions in four cities to honour the lives of the missing and murdered in Ontario.\n Last winter, the government asked for proposals for commemorations. The inquiry's interim report in 2017 called on the federal government to establish such a fund in co-operation with Indigenous organizations, \"family coalitions, Indigenous artists, and grassroots advocates.\"\n Approvals were underway when the national inquiry issued its final report in early June.\n In that report, the inquiry commissioners said they were glad to see the government funding these projects, but weren't pleased that only \"legally constituted organizations\" would receive money, leaving out informal and grassroots groups.\n \"This excludes these very same family coalitions and grassroots organizations we wanted to include, who have been organizing around missing and murdered women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people for decades with very little support,\" the report said, using an acronym for two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, and asexual.\n \"It can be a long and onerous process to legally incorporate as an organization; coupled with the very short time frame organizations were given to apply, this almost certainly excludes the very groups we intended this recommendation to reach.\"\n Monsef spokeswoman Justine Villeneuve said the call for projects required that applicants work with communities, survivors and families in conceiving their proposals so they \"could define how to help honour the lives and legacies of their loved ones,\" and applications also had to explain how survivors and families will be involved in the final work. Also, she said, Indigenous external review committees examined the applications.\n The government had planned to spend $10 million on the projects but upped the amount to $13 million because of the high demand, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Related Topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright  Prince George Citizen\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail this article to a Friend\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Email Address: *\n\nYour Name: *\n\nTo Email Address: *\n\n* Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.\n\n\nMessage: *\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2039\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nprevious\nFeds spend $275 million LNG Canada project, including cash to buy gas turbines\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nnext\nCanucks an 'awesome' opportunity to provide physicality, leadership: J.T.

Our 400 years of shared history has brought us a massive gap in the quality of life between indigenous peoples and the rest of Canada.\u201d\nBellegarde had called on natives to come out for the first time en masse to vote in the last elections that swept Trudeau\u2019s Liberals into power.\nIt was an effort to sway public policy after years of inaction on native issues, including gross poverty and desperation in many aboriginal communities that breeds abuse, suicide and crime.\nA record eight aboriginal Liberal MPs were elected in October, and two were named to Trudeau\u2019s cabinet, including Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.\nNative leaders and activists have been calling for an inquiry for more than a decade, since dozens of prostitutes went missing in Vancouver\u2019s seedy Downtown Eastside and were later determined to have been victims of a serial killer.\nA 2014 report and an update this year by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police identified 1,049 murdered and 172 missing aboriginal women dating back to 1980.\nIn most cases, the perpetrators were known to the victims.\nWilson-Raybould said the inquiry will be held in the Spring following consultations with victims\u2019 families and native groups.\n\u201cNo inquiry can undo what happened nor can it restore what we have lost,\u201d she said.\nBut the violence against indigenous women \u2014 who represent four per cent of the population and 16 per cent of homicide victims \u2014 \u201cis a national tragedy that requires an urgent and deliberate national response,\u201d she said.\nWilson-Raybould noted the \u201cheartbreaking reality that girls born in our indigenous communities are three times more likely to experience violent crime.\u201d\nPast studies have linked the violence to racism, sexism, colonialism, poverty, unemployment, lack of safe transportation, mental health and substance abuse, according to Status of Women Minister Patty Hajdu.\nIndigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett said the goal of the inquiry is to bring an end to the ongoing violence through \u201cconcrete actions.\u201d\n\u201cThe victims deserve justice,\u201d said Trudeau, \u201ctheir families an opportunity to heal, and to be heard. We must work together to put an end to this on going tragedy\u201d.\nIn addition to ordering the inquiry, Trudeau vowed to make \u201csignificant investments\u201d in native education and to lift a cap on federal funding for indigenous communities.\nFurthermore, he said Canada would \u201cfully implement\u201d the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\nCanada and three other countries \u2014 Australia, New Zealand and the United States \u2014 were the only nations to vote against the UN indigenous text in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\nTags Canada into one thousand two hundred murdered or missing women to open inquiry\n\n\n\n\nShare article\n\nShare this\nTweet this\nSend to email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPREVIOUS STORY: First Briton to travel to ISS blasts off into space \n\nNEXT STORY: Pakistani man dies \u2014 while attempting selfie with moving train \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRENDING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKTM raises senior citizen ticket discount to 50%\n17 Jan 2017, 07:01PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBNM: Exporters must convert 75% of earnings into ringgit\n2 Dec 2016, 11:12PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Chicken Rice spots in Malacca town\n4 Dec 2015, 03:12PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem of water pollution in Malaysia becoming serious, says WWF\n24 Sep 2015, 07:09AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was lucky to record Suasana Hari Raya, says Anuar Zain (video)\n17 Jul 2015, 06:07PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\n \n\n\nLATEST CONTENT\n\n\n\n\n\nLETTERS...RAKYAT\n\n\n\nInvestigate Sikh religious symbol \u2018Khanda\u2019 on slippers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolumnists\n\n\n\nVenus William denies fault for fatal accident\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEAVE US YOUR FEEDBACK\n\n\n\nHow do you like the new site\nLeave your feedback here.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a story worth sharing?\nSend us your details here.\n\n\n\n\ntest\n \n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nRSS\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 The Rakyat Post\n\nTerms of Use \u203a \u00a0\n\t\t\t\tPrivacy Policy \u203a \u00a0\n\t\t\t\tContact \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Seeing is believing, after all.\nThe upcoming inquiry, which is slated to hold its first public meeting May 29 in Whitehorse, is first and foremost a fundamental acknowledgment of a made-in-Canada tragedy: between 1980 and 2012, nearly 1,200 indigenous girls and women were murdered or went missing, according to the RCMP.\nOne of the concerns currently being raised about the $54-million initiative is that two years - the proposed allotted time-frame- won't be long enough to ensure that every voice gets heard.\nBut as necessary as the inquiry is, it is also not unreasonable to expect that some people who want to tell their story, no matter how harrowing and important, may not get that opportunity - at least not during the life of the inquiry.\nTwo years may go by in a blink. But it's still long enough to get to the heart of underlying issues negatively impacting indigenous women. In the meantime, let's get on with the necessary job of empowerment.\nImmediately.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Posted in\n        Editorials\n        \n        on\n        \n            Wednesday, May 17, 2017 7:49 am.\n            \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nRules of Conduct\n\n\n1 Keep it Clean.

Our loved ones deserve justice now, and they deserve to be safe.\u201dDuring a media conference in Ottawa on Saturday, Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Marc Miller said the federal government\u2019s efforts to keep Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQ+ people safe in the four years since the release of the 231 Calls for Justice have been \u201congoing,\u201d and claimed the federal Liberals have an \u201cunwavering commitment\u201d to continue that work.Miller cited a number of steps that he says the Liberals have taken in recent years, including funding more than 1,000 Indigenous language programs, introducing a national action plan to end gender-based violence, and appointing Jennifer Moore Rattray as the Ministerial Special Representative who will provide advice and recommendations to create an Indigenous and Human Rights Ombudsperson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOver the last year, we\u2019ve also continued to advance the priorities outlined in the national action plan and responded to calls for justice directed at the federal government,\u201d Miller said.\u201cWe will continue this work together to make a positive long lasting impact in communities. This includes housing, shelter, transportation, infrastructure, and direct supports for the well-being of families and survivors.\u201dIndigenous leaders on the provincial level in Manitoba have also called for more action to move the 231 Calls for Justice forward, as on Saturday, Southern Chiefs\u2019 Organization (SCO) Grand Chief Jerry Daniels released a media statement calling on Manitoba\u2019s PC government and all levels of government to put more urgency into implementing those calls.\u201cProgress has also been slow in terms of implementing the 231 Calls for Justice,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cWe know there are many advocates and family members who continue to push for justice for their loved ones. We stand with all impacted citizens.\u201dIn a joint statement by Premier Heather Stefanson, Indigenous Reconciliation and Northern Relations Minister Eileen Clarke and Families Minister and Minister responsible for gender equity Manitoba Rochelle Squires, the provincial government pledged to move forward on implementation through a \u2018whole-of-Manitoba\u2019 approach based on partnerships, co-development and collaboration.\u201cOur government remains committed to working closely with Indigenous leadership, community-based organizations and law enforcement to continue to respond to the Calls for Justice of the national inquiry and to combat gender-based violence in Manitoba,\u201d read the statement.\u201cWe must also continue to listen to the voices of those directly affected to further acknowledge the individual and collective strength, courage, and resilience that families, survivors and communities continue to demonstrate while fighting for justice and safety for Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ peoples.\u201d\u2014 Dave Baxter is a Local Journalism Initiative reporter who works out of the Winnipeg Sun.

Here is what\u2019s on the radar of our editors for the morning of Nov. 15.\nWhat we are watching in Canada \u2026\nOTTAWA  \u2013  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is finishing a week of meetings with opposition leaders today by sitting down with the Green party\u2019s Elizabeth May this morning.\nMay has stepped down as party leader, but is still the head of the Greens\u2019 three-member caucus in the House of Commons.\nTrudeau has been seeking common ground with the Conservative, Bloc Quebecois and NDP leaders in separate sessions as he prepares to return to Parliament in December without a majority in the Commons.\nHe\u2019ll need the backing of at least one of those parties to get any law passed, and his first test will be to get support for his speech from the throne, laying out his general plans for governing.\nThe Greens elected more MPs in the October vote than they\u2019ve ever had, but remain the only party in the Commons that doesn\u2019t have the numbers to give Trudeau\u2019s Liberals a win by voting with the government.\nThat makes the meeting more a courtesy than a negotiation between rivals seeking to find compromises to advance their agendas.\n\u2014\nAlso this \u2026\nEDMONTON  \u2013  An Edmonton charity that has supported philanthropy in the community since 1953 says Alberta\u2019s inquiry into so-called \u201canti-Albertan\u201d activities is polarizing, undemocratic and unfounded.\nThe Muttart Foundation, which supports early childhood education and other charities, has written a letter to Steve Allan, commissioner of the Public Inquiry Into Funding of Anti-Alberta Energy Campaigns.\nIt says the commission is creating a \u201cclimate of fear\u201d by suggesting there is a price to be paid for disagreeing with the government.\nThe 174-page letter says its not unAlbertan to criticize the oil and gas industry  \u2013  it\u2019s democratic.\nIt uses government statistics to show foreign sources make up a tiny fraction of the revenue to Canadian charities.\nFoundation director Bob Wyatt says he just wants any recommendations from the inquiry to be founded on fact.\n\u2014\nICYMI (In case you missed it) \u2026\nHALIFAX  \u2013  There is something funky at the bottom of the Bay of Fundy.\nA new survey estimates more than 1.8 million pieces of garbage are strewn over the bottom of the bay, prompting concerns about potential harm to marine life.\nThe study published Thursday in Marine Pollution Bulletin found an average of 137 pieces of plastic litter, dumped or lost fishing gear and other garbage per square kilometre of ocean.\nThe researchers used underwater photography at 281 locations over the past three years to extrapolate the amount of garbage present in a bay.\nPlastics, especially plastic bags, comprised slightly over half of the total, while fishing gear ranging from traps to gloves was close to 30 per cent. Other garbage  \u2013  including tires or metal  \u2013  was just over one fifth of the total waste documented.\nBiologist Tony Walker, assistant professor in the school for resource and environmental studies at Dalhousie University, said the litter eliminates potential habitat by covering the bottom.\n\u2014\nWhat we are watching in the U.S. \u2026\nSANTA CLARITA, Calif.  \u2013  People who knew the 16-year-old boy suspected of killing two students in a burst of gunfire at a high school outside Los Angeles described him as a quiet, smart kid who they would never expect to turn violent.\nOne fellow junior at Saugus High School said the suspect is a Boy Scout who she relied on to study for advanced placement European history. A student in his physics class said he seemed like \u201cone of those normal kids.\u201d A next-door neighbour who grew up with him said he kept to himself but was never threatening.\nThe attacker shot five students, seemingly at random, and then shot himself in the head around 7:30 a.m. Thursday, his 16th birthday, authorities said. Two students died, and the gunman was gravely wounded.\nPolice have not publicly identified the shooter because he is a minor. The Associated Press determined his identity based on property records for his home, which police said was searched after the shooting, and interviews with three of his friends.\nThe boy lived with his mother in a modest home on a leafy street in Santa Clarita, a Los Angeles suburb of about 210,000 people known for good schools, safe streets and relatively affordable housing.\nPolice said they had yet to determine a motive and any relationship between the gunman and the victims. Authorities said they have no indication the boy was acting on behalf of any group or ideology.\n\u2014\nWhat we are watching in the rest of the world \u2026\nMEXICO CITY  \u2013  Bolivia\u2019s Evo Morales called for the United Nations, and possibly Pope Francis, to mediate in the Andean nation\u2019s political crisis following his ouster as president in what he called a coup d\u2019etat that forced him into exile in Mexico.\nIn an interview Thursday in Mexico City, Morales said he is in fact still the president of Bolivia since the country\u2019s Legislative Assembly has not yet accepted his resignation, which he presented Sunday at the urging of military leaders following weeks of protests against a re-election that his opponents called fraudulent.\nMorales said he would return to Bolivia from Mexico, which has granted him political asylum, if that would contribute to his country\u2019s pacification.\nPolitical analyst Kathryn Ledebur of the non-profit Andean Information Network in Bolivia, who has lived in the country for nearly 30 years, said Morales could have a case.\n\u201cA resignation letter has to be presented and considered, and accepted in the plenary before it goes into effect,\u201d she said. \u201cDo I think that Evo wants to return and be president  \u2013  I don\u2019t see that. But does he want to mess with them? Yes. He wants to keep them guessing.\u201d\nTwo days after arriving in Mexico, Morales said he had received information that some Bolivian army troops are planning to \u201crebel\u201d against the officers who urged him to resign. But he gave no further specifics on how many were in on the plan, or how they would rebel.\nMorales said he was \u201csurprised by the betrayal of the commander in chief of the armed forces,\u201d Williams Kaliman.\n\u2014\nWeird and wild \u2026\nSEATTLE  \u2013  Can old dogs teach us new tricks? Scientists are looking for 10,000 pets for the largest study of aging in canines. They hope to shed light on human longevity, too.\nThe project will collect a pile of pooch data: vet records, DNA samples, gut microbes and information on food and walks. Five hundred dogs will test a pill that could slow the aging process.\n\u201cWhat we learn will potentially be good for dogs and has great potential to translate to human health,\u201d said project co-director Daniel Promislow of the University of Washington School of Medicine.\nIf scientists find a genetic marker for a type of cancer in dogs, for instance, that could be explored in humans.\nOwners will complete periodic online surveys and take their dogs to the vet once a year, with the possibility of extra visits for certain tests. Their welfare will be monitored by a bioethicist and a panel of animal welfare advisers.\nThe five-year study was formally started Thursday at a science meeting in Austin, Texas. The National Institute on Aging is paying for the $23-million project because dogs and humans share the same environment, get the same diseases and dogs\u2019 shorter lifespans allow quicker research results, said deputy director, Dr. Marie Bernard. The data collected will be available to all scientists.\n\u2014\nOn this day in 1877 \u201c\u00a6\nThe Northwest Council passed laws to conserve the bison. However, by 1880, the bison had practically disappeared from the plains of Canada, destroying the traditional way of life of First Nations and Metis living on the Prairies.\n\u2014\nCelebrity news \u2026\nTORONTO  \u2013  One of Louis C.K.\u2019s accusers is disputing a Canadian comedy club CEO\u2019s reasons for booking the standup superstar earlier this year.\nJulia Wolov says she is \u201cinfuriated\u201d by an article written by Yuk Yuk\u2019s founder Mark Breslin for the Canadian Jewish News that downplays sexual misconduct she and several other women faced from the disgraced comic.\nWolov, a L.A.-based comedy writer, penned a counterpoint that lists several inaccuracies in Breslin\u2019s article, which claimed she and others consented to sexual behaviour that occurred more than 10 years ago.\nC.K. admitted to exposing himself to several women while in a position of power following a bombshell 2017 New York Times report involving five accusers.\nWolov says she hasn\u2019t spoken about her experiences since that New York Times story, but was moved to go public this week because Breslin touted C.K.\u2019s Jewish heritage as another reason to support him. Wolov says she and three of his other accusers from the article are also Jewish.\nShe says she did not consent to C.K. undressing and masturbating in front of her, and to suggest otherwise is wrong.\nBreslin booked C.K. for a string of sold-out shows in Toronto in October. He declined further comment but says in his article that \u201crattling the cage of polite society is part of the job of comics, onstage and off.\u201d\n\u2014\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 15, 2019.\nShare this story:63\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n\n Facebook\n Twitter\n YouTube\n\n\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nSubscription Services\nArchive\n \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nThe Lethbridge Herald\nOther Publications\nFood For Thought\n Contact\nCareers\n \n\n\nContact the Lethbridge Herald\n\n504 - 7th Street South\n\t\t\t\t\tLethbridge, AB T1J 3Z7\n[P] (403) 328-4411\n[F] (403)328-4536\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrint Advertising: (403) 328-4410\n\t\t\t\t\tNational Advertising: (403) 380-7585\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Advertising: (403) 380-7585\n\t\t\t\t\tClassifieds: (403) 328-4433\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2019 The Lethbridge Herald\nAdvertising\nTerms and Conditions & Privacy Policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(CP)          \n\n\n\n\n\n\tOTTAWA \u2014 After shaping the design and scope of the inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women, the federal government is set to hand over the process to five commissioners Wednesday at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Que.\n\n\tA ceremony, expected to\u00a0feature a number of\u00a0indigenous traditions, will be held in the morning to mark the beginning of the commission's work.\n\n\tIndigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and Status of Women Minister Patty Hajdu will be on hand for the event. The ministers are also expected to meet the families of some victims following the announcement.\n\nRELATED:\n\n\nPolicing under scrutiny at inquiry into missing, murdered indigenous women\n\nFive things about the inquiry set to study missing and murdered indigenous women\n\n\n\tIt is expected to be a highly emotional day for a number of long-time advocates who have repeatedly called on the federal government to open\u00a0a\u00a0national public inquiry into\u00a0the phenomenon of missing and murdered indigenous women.\n\n\tThe study \u2014 resisted by the Conservative government of former prime minister Stephen Harper \u2014 was\u00a0a key Liberal campaign promise\u00a0during the last federal election.\n\n\tSheila North Wilson, grand chief of an organization representing First Nations in northern Manitoba, said Tuesday she hopes the study will help\u00a0unravel the \"massive problem\" piece by piece.\n\n\tShe said\u00a0she's hoping the government will speak \"directly to the hearts and minds\" of indigenous families on Wednesday.\n\n\tDuring the course of their work, the commissioners will have the power to summon witnesses and\u00a0compel testimony.\n\n\tTwo central questions for the upcoming process\u00a0include how long will the study take and how much will it all cost?\n\n\tThe federal government has earmarked $40 million over two years for the inquiry but Bennett has said\u00a0this is a placeholder budget and stressed the need to get the process \"right.\"\n\n\tIt is expected that the commissioners could face a number of challenges during the course of their\u00a0work, such as the need to\u00a0examine the nature of violence against indigenous women\u00a0in urban centres and in indigenous communities themselves.\n\n\tJoan Jack, an Ojibway activist from Manitoba, has stressed the need for the inquiry to look\u00a0at what is happening on reserve.\n\n\tWomen are\u00a0routinely oppressed and subjected to violence, she said.\n\n\t\"It is only the very strongest and very connected women that are able to rise above that,\" Jack said in an interview Tuesday.\n\n\t\"There's just a level of violence in our communities that is a crisis and no one seems to care.\"\n\n\tThere will have to be a lot of healing inside communities, North Wilson\u00a0said,\u00a0adding she\u00a0hopes Canadians will\u00a0use the inquiry process to better understand what is happening to indigenous women and girls.\n\n\t\"We have a lot to contribute as indigenous women and girls,\" North Wilson said.\n\n\t\"We\u00a0want the same thing that everybody wants \u2014 we want health, we want equality, we want jobs, we want to be educated and we want opportunities ... \u00a0we should be afforded that. That's at the heart of the issue ... it is a Canadian problem.\"\n\n\tIn May 2014, the RCMP\u00a0released a report documenting\u00a01,181 murdered and missing women between 1980 and 2012.\n\n\tA year later,\u00a0it said\u00a032 aboriginal women had been murdered and 11 more had disappeared since it first reported on the issue.\n\n\tThe RCMP\u00a0also noted there is an\u00a0\"unmistakable connection between homicide and family violence.\"\n\n\tThe force said the relationship between victim and offender was particularly relevant because more than\u00a090 per cent of the women in\u00a0the homicide data were known to the offender.\n\n\tMistrust toward police forces\u00a0and the need to examine officer conduct is also\u00a0expected to be a central\u00a0theme of the inquiry process.\n\n\t\u2014Follow @kkirkup on Twitter\n\n\tKristy Kirkup, The Canadian Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Report a Problem\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideos\nAll videos\n\n\nLatest\nEditor's picks\nMost viewed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoney Monitor: The costs of kind...\n\n\n\n\nXavier Dolan's new drama among C...\n\n\n\n\nReactions mixed to indigenous wo...\n\n\n\n\nNew funding to complement indige...\n\n\n\n\nP.E.I. man campaigning door-to-d...\n\n\n\n\nFirst Nations say Yukon salmon d...\n\n\n\n\nNovak Djokovic not dwelling on Z...\n\n\n\n\nP.K.

Indigenous women make up 4.3 per cent of the Canadian population, but they account for 16 per cent of murdered women and 11.3 per cent of missing women in Canada. Over the past 30 years, 1,026 Indigenous women have been murdered and 160 are missing.\nAs noted on their website, \"On Wednesday, September 9, Chiefs of Ontario launched our Who Is She campaign -- a fundraising effort aimed at creating a First Nations-led, community-driven process to eradicate violence against Indigenous women and girls.\" Beyond calling for a federal inquiry (now supported by all federal political parties except the Conservatives), the Chiefs of Ontario want a First Nations-led process as well.\nTheir rationale is, \"Every Indigenous woman and girl should feel safe every time of every day in every place in Canada. Our families can\u2019t wait for Ottawa to stop Indigenous women and girls from disappearing. We are planning our own process to bring safety to our peoples. ...We are looking to achieve truth and tangible solutions through a First Nations driven process to end violence in our communities.\"\nThe Council of Canadians believes an inquiry is needed to understand the root causes of this situation and to develop a national action plan. In October 2012, we added our support to the Sisters In Spirit Vigils -- A Movement for Social Change joint statement that highlights, \"An inquiry would be a crucial step in implementing a comprehensive and coordinated national action plan.\"\nOn Sunday October 4, just two weeks before the federal election, we will be on Parliament Hill to join with the Families of Sisters in Spirit for a 10th anniversary Honouring our Sisters in Spirit gathering. \n\n\n\nAssembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde says a national inquiry would help expose the colonial roots of violence against Indigenous women in Canada. CBC has reported, \"Bellegarde said the lingering impacts of the 'cultural genocide' of the residential school system and the imposition of the Indian Act on First Nations communities continue to 'really hurt indigenous peoples in Canada.'\" About 150,000 Indigenous children in this country were forced to attend residential schools.\nAs referenced above, the federal New Democrats, Liberals and Greens agree that an inquiry is needed. The provincial premiers agree that a national inquiry is needed too. The United Nations special rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous people and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights have also called for a national inquiry. It's only the Harper government that refuses to convene this inquiry.\nFor a Council of Canadians fact sheet on this issue, please click here.\nFurther reading\nHamilton chapter holds public forum on murdered and missing Indigenous women (June 2015 blog) WIN!

Indigenous organizations have been calling for an inquiry: Groups, including the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada and the Assembly of First Nations, have for years urged the federal government to open a national public inquiry into the phenomenon of missing and murdered indigenous women. They will closely examine the terms of reference and the commissioners selected. There are five people expected to sit on the body.\nIn May 2014, the RCMP released a report documenting 1,181 murdered and missing women between 1980 and 2012. A year later, it said 32 aboriginal women had been murdered and 11 more disappeared since it first reported on the issue.\n2. The Liberal government plans to be flexible on timeline and funding: The federal government has banked on spending $40 million over the next two years on the inquiry but some observers already wonder if this will be enough money and time for the commissioners to do their work. Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett has noted this is a \u201cplaceholder\u201d budget and she has consistently stressed the need to get the inquiry right.\n3. The previous government did not support an inquiry: Former prime minister Stephen Harper opposed a formal examination of the issue of murdered and missing indigenous women. He noted there were already a number of studies on the record and stressed the need for action.\n4. The commission will be able to compel witnesses to testify: Under the Inquiries Act, the commissioners will have the same powers as any court in a civil case to enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give evidence. They may also examine all papers, documents, vouchers, records and books belonging a public office or institution.\n5. Child welfare is expected to be a central theme of the study: Bennett says child welfare will be a key issue. She said the government has repeatedly heard about the \u201cdevastating\u201d impact on children who are apprehended and what often happens to their mothers.\nThe government is currently engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal over federal funding for child welfare services on reserve.\nIn January, the tribunal ruled the federal government discriminated against First Nations children in its funding of child welfare services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Twitter            \n\n\n\n                Facebook            \n\n\n\n                Google+ Share            \n\n\n\n                LinkedIn            \n\n\n\n                Reddit            \n\n\n\n                Email            \n\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under:\n\n\nMissing and murdered indigenous women\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n      \u2002\u2002\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\nPrevious Welcome to an age where the facts don\u2019t matter\n\n\nNext Introducing the Maclean\u2019s archives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow comments\nHide comments \n        (1)\n    \n \n\n\n\n\nWhat to know about the missing and murdered indigenous women inquiry \n\n\n\n\nThe one thing we truly know, is it is going to be a waste of taxpayers dollars.\n\n\n\n\nReply \u2193 \n\n\n\n \n\n\nDick Burn on August 2, 2016 at 9:17 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cancel reply \nSign in to comment.You're logged in as  .

Inside was a digital copy of all the pre-inquiry research.\nThe five commissioners responsible for carrying out the inquiry are:\n\u2014 Chief commissioner Marion Buller, B.C.\u2019s first female First Nations judge;\n\u2014 Michele Audette, a former president of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada;\n\u2014 Qajaq Robinson, an Ottawa-based, Nunavut-born lawyer who practices civil litigation with an emphasis on aboriginal law;\n\u2014 Marilyn Poitras, a professor at the University of Saskatchewan professor with a focus on indigenous law;\n\u2014 Brian Eyolfson, a First Nations lawyer based in Ontario.\nUnder the Inquiries Act, the commissioners will have the same powers as any court in a civil case to enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give evidence. They can also examine all papers, documents, vouchers, records and books belonging a public office or institution.\nFamily information liaison units will also provide centralized resources for families of missing or murdered indigenous women and girls and gather information during the inquiry process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Twitter            \n\n\n\n                Facebook            \n\n\n\n                Google+ Share            \n\n\n\n                LinkedIn            \n\n\n\n                Reddit            \n\n\n\n                Email            \n\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under:\n\n\nJody Wilson-Raybould\nmissing and murdered aboriginal women\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n      \u2002\u2002\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\nPrevious Welcome to an age where the facts don\u2019t matter\n\n\nNext Introducing the Maclean\u2019s archives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow comments\nHide comments \n        (1)\n    \n \n\n\n\n\nGovernment sets terms for MMIW inquiry \n\n\n\n\nIf you are an Indian Girl/Woman and you DON\u2019T want to get Beaten Up/Killed Don\u2019t Shack Up/Marry an Indian Man..\n\n\n\n\nReply \u2193 \n\n\n\n \n\n\nJoeFrmEdm on August 3, 2016 at 4:04 pm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cancel reply \nSign in to comment.You're logged in as  .

Indigenous organizations\u00a0have been calling for an inquiry: Groups, including the Native Women's Association of Canada and the Assembly of First Nations, have for years urged the federal government to open a national public inquiry into the phenomenon of missing and murdered indigenous women. They will closely examine the terms of reference\u00a0and the commissioners selected. There are five people expected to sit on the body.\nIn May 2014, the RCMP\u00a0released a report documenting\u00a01,181 murdered and missing women between 1980 and 2012. A year later,\u00a0it said\u00a032 aboriginal women had been murdered and 11 more disappeared since it first reported on the issue.\n2. The Liberal government plans to be flexible on timeline and funding: The federal government has banked on spending $40 million over the next two years on the inquiry but some observers already wonder if this will be enough money and time for the commissioners to do their work. Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett has noted this is a \"placeholder\" budget and she\u00a0has consistently stressed the need to get the inquiry right.\n3. The previous government did not support\u00a0an inquiry: Former prime minister Stephen Harper opposed\u00a0a formal examination\u00a0of the issue of murdered and missing indigenous women. He noted there were already a number of studies on the record and stressed the need for action.\n4. The commission will be able to compel witnesses to testify: Under the Inquiries Act,\u00a0the\u00a0commissioners will have the\u00a0same powers as any court in a civil case to enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give evidence.

Child welfare is expected to be a central theme of the study: Bennett says child welfare will be a key issue. She said the government has repeatedly heard about the \"devastating\" impact on children who are apprehended and what often happens to their mothers.\nThe government is currently engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal over federal funding for child welfare services on reserve.\nIn January, the tribunal ruled the federal government discriminated against First Nations children in its funding of child welfare services.\nKristy Kirkup, The Canadian Press\n\u00a92016 The Canadian Press\n\nShare Twitter\nFacebook\nGoogle+\nReddit\nForward\n \nTopics:\u00a0\nNational\n\n\nJoin the Discussion\nNews Talk 650 CKOM is happy to provide a forum for commenting and discussion.

Funding from the federal government changed year to year, meaning there was no way to know if a program started one year would exist the next.\nA new agreement between the Assembly of First Nations and federal government hopes to solve that problem.\nThe AFN and federal government signed a fiscal agreement Tuesday at the AFN\u2019s 37th annual general assembly happening over the next three days in Niagara Falls.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the understanding of communities needing to be able to plan. Having funding just one year at a time and not knowing if it\u2019s coming the next year has made it impossible for communities to plan,\u201d said Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to work with First Nations to develop a system that will work better.\u201d\nBoth Bennett and AFN National Chief Perry Bellegarde said the signing of the agreement is end of the 2 per cent cap on funding that impacts programs like education and health. It will start flowing funding\u00a0from the 2016 federal budget into communities as\u00a0Ottawa earmarked $8.4 billion in funding for First Nations.\n\u201cToday we are moving to ensure the 2 per cent cap is gone,\u201d said Bellegarde. \u201cThat funding cap has been in place for 20 years. That cap on potential. That cap on productivity. That cap on growth.\u201d\nHe said the new agreement is expected to be one based on needs, on and off reserve.\n\u201cOne based on long-term, predictable and sustainable funding,\u201d said Bellegarde. \u201cOne that reflects your nation-to-nation relationship.\u201d\nBut not everyone agreed with the new agreement, particularly AFN Ontario Regional Chief Isadore Day.\nDay told Bellegarde Monday he couldn\u2019t support the agreement, also known as a memo of understanding (MOU), as he saw it being \u201crammed through\u201d.\n\u201cI did not agree to the MOU,\u201d Day wrote Bellegarde in an email Monday. \u201cWe are going to have to address this.\u201d\nDay called for an emergency meeting among AFN executive Monday where Bellegarde said all of the 11 member executive except\u00a0Day supported moving forward with the agreement.\nBellegarde also said chiefs passed numerous resolutions to remove the 2 per cent cap.\n\u201cBecause there was concerns we didn\u2019t pass a formal resolution \u2026 I called an emergency meeting to clear the air. We did that and we got our motion to proceed,\u201d said Bellegarde. \u201cOne abstention \u2013 Chief Day.\u201d\nDay declined to comment when APTN asked him to clarify his stance on the agreement.\nThe AFN and Indigenous Affairs will form a fiscal working group.\nThe AFN also signed a new policing agreement with the RCMP that hopes to start a begin a new relationship with the federal police force that patrols many First Nations.\nIt\u2019s not binding to any community but done more so in an inspiration to start over said the AFN.\nNational Chief Perry Bellegarde introduces RCMP Comm. Bob Paulson Tuesday.\nBellegarde signed the agreement with Commissioner Bob Paulson also Tuesday morning.\nAs for the pending announcement on a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women Bennett said \u201cwe\u2019re getting close.\u201d\nWhat seems to be holding up the announcement is getting all the provinces and territories on board. Bennett told APTN each one has to agree to the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference and the commissioners picked by the federal government.\nkjackson@aptn.ca\n@afixedaddress\n\n\nTags: afn assembly, Bob Paulson, Carolyn Bennett, Featured, fiscal agreement, Isadore Day, Niagara Falls, Perry Bellegarde\n\n\n\nKenneth Jackson\n\t\t\t\t\tOttawa Bureau\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tView all posts by Kenneth Jackson \u2192 \n\n\n\n\nNunavut Day 2016: Iqaluit residents gather to take in display of Inuit culture\nOntario strikes deal to sell Hydro One shares to First Nations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch for:\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Posts\n\n\nElders teach youth about their roots during Samson Cree Nation gathering \nUPDATED: Forest fires evacuate hundreds from communities northwest of Winnipeg \nGwich\u2019in Tribal Council calls for review over \u2018lenient\u2019 sentence in killing of 17-year-old \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t@APTNNews on Twitter\n\t\t \n\n\nTweets by @APTNNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrown withdraws expense charges against Sen.

The fact Indigenous people nursed ancestors of newcomers back to health upon arrival, recognizing they were near death, seeking a place of safety, fleeing discrimination, oppression and mass murder in Europe, seeking health, leaving behind famine and poverty, seeking freedom to practice their own religions and so much more in what was termed the new world (research \u201cDismantle Doctrine of Discovery\u201d). Descendants of those newcomers have benefited greatly through the generations, however, unfortunately, have lost their memories of how their great lives have come to be \u2014 basically due to their governments keeping the truth from them, lying to them about Indigenous people and ultimately benefiting at the expense and demise of the Indigenous populations under the false belief of the Doctrine of Discovery.The waking up process is difficult for some yet there is now no reason to not take up the responsibility of not just correcting wrongs and ensuring history is rewritten in truth. This is happening all over Canada as First Peoples are given first priority. All legislation, policies and regulations must be scrutinized and addressed with this view in mind and there can no longer be anything done without our consent, knowledge and involvement; nothing about us, without us. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has declared there is no relationship more important to Canada than that with Indigenous peoples. He is absolutely right as without the Indigenous peoples, there would be no Canada. We nursed you when your ancestors arrived, we saved your skin in the War of 1812, the list goes on and on. When Canadians realize why the North West Mounted Police (now RCMP) was first established (to keep control of or kill the Indigenous people) and realize all policing in Canada flows from that earliest organization, they begin to see and understand how national policing later affected provincial policing and eventually regional policing up to this day.Is it any wonder then policing all over Canada has not done justice to the Indigenous women who have been murdered or gone missing? The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls must not be an exercise in futility.It represents a massive amount of work that started with Ontario Native Women\u2019s Association (ONWA) in the mid- to late-1980s and resulted in the first ever report, \u201cBreaking Free (1989),\u201d which first identified the need for Indigenous women\u2019s safety, followed by summits, resolutions to Native Women of Canada and partners joining in who all accepted the call to finally have a national inquiry for which ONWA pushed and took the lead all along the way.Indigenous women\u2019s lives matter. They are the foundation of our families, communities and nations. This is why we need a full investigation into each and every incident of policing involving Indigenous women and family members \u2014 now. Every Canadian should be mortified with the latest, very public murder. It screams and begs the question: why was an officer able to get his gun out and kill a young Indigenous woman when he was on wellness check in the Maritimes? The only answer is he already had his gun out and my friends, that is the reality and it speaks volumes. These incidents are inexcusable and need to be punished. There can be no impunity for law enforcement any longer \u2014 First Peoples are first priority. Let\u2019s get it right this time as the time to act is now. No more nice, patronizing and placating words. Let\u2019s see action. Get more from the Niagara Falls Review in your inboxNever miss the latest news from the Niagara Falls Review.

Offering to respect any evidence police needed to hold back.\nComposite sketch released by Gatineau Police of man believed to have been involved in Kelly Morrisseau\u2019s death\n\u00a0\nIn September, after months of uncertainty, Gatineau police spokesman Const. JP Lemay said they couldn\u2019t do it.\nIt would have been uncommon for police to open their file to the media said Lemay.\nThe former lead detective, who retired two years ago, never knowing who killed Morrisseau, also wasn\u2019t available.\n\u201cThe fact that it is an active police investigation, our people do not want to talk about details,\u201d said Lemay.\nHe said it\u2019s active in the sense that police still occasionally get \u201cnew tips so investigators work the info in priority.\u201d\nThe lead investigator on Morrisseau\u2019s case had \u201ccommunications\u201d with the family this week.\n\u201cTheir response is touching and motivating for him,\u201d said Lemay.\nMorrisseau\u2019s cousin Roxanne, was on Parliament Hill Tuesday when the national inquiry was announced.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just hopeful we\u2019ll get some closure as a family and get some healing,\u201d said Morrisseau of a national inquiry.\nHer and Kelly\u2019s aunt, Glenda Morrisseau, was found murdered in 1991 in Winnipeg, Man.\nHer murder also remains unsolved.\nThere was a sign of hope about two years ago when APTN first reported that police had a potential new suspect in early 2013.\nThey had their eyes on Marc Leduc, a man who was charged with the murders of two Ottawa women, one dating back to 2008.\nThey were going to compare Leduc\u2019s DNA to evidence the killer left behind, suggesting police at least have DNA of the man who killed Morrisseau.\nThat determined to be inconclusive.\nLeduc wasn\u2019t the first person police had asked to take a DNA test. The investigation has taken them throughout the country and it\u2019s believed parts of the United States.\nLemay said, while all murders are terrible, Morrisseau\u2019s left a lasting impact on those within the force.\nAPTN visited the parking lot where Morrisseau was found Thursday.\nThe sun was shinning and it was warm as joggers and cyclists moved about.\nAs for her two youngest children they are growing up in a world without their mom, waiting for answers, like so many Indigenous families across the country.\nkjackson@aptn.ca\u200e\n\nFollow @afixedaddress\n\n\n\n\nTags: Featured, kelly morrisseau, Kenneth Jackson, Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Murder, Ottawa, unsolved murder\n\n\n\nKenneth Jackson\n\t\t\t\t\tOttawa Bureau\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tView all posts by Kenneth Jackson \u2192 \n\n\n\n\nBody of girl, 13, found by police in Attawapiskat\nAssembly of First Nations ends special chiefs assembly on a high note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch for:\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Posts\n\n\nWinnipeg police charge man, 53, with second-degree murder in Tina Fontaine death 0 comments \nEarly morning start to first phase of #MMIW inquiry in Ottawa 0 comments \nA Royal Commission, the Minister of Indigenous Affairs and the Energy East pipeline on the Dec 10 edition of N2N 0 comments \nWatch Prime Minister Trudeau\u2019s address to the AFN\u2019s Special Chiefs Assembly here 1 comment \nFamilies of MMIW preparing to meet Liberal government Friday in Ottawa 0 comments \nClimate talks in Paris, a Q and A with Tantoo Cardinal 0 comments \nQuebec chiefs demanding Indigenous investigators join Val D\u2019Or abuse investigation 0 comments \nTrudeau leaves chiefs in a good mood after speech at AFN gathering 0 comments \nProtester explains why group chained themselves to Line 9 pipeline equipment 0 comments \nFormer Alberta Judge says a new system is needed for First Nation governance to work 0 comments \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\t\t@APTNNews on Twitter\n\t\t \n\n\nTweets by @APTNNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMMIW advocate says threats against Alberta Premier Notley unacceptable\n\n\n\n9 hours ago\n\n\nNational News \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaskatoon program helps young people get out of gangs, off streets\n\n\n\n13 hours ago\n\n\nNational News \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRC set to release final report Tuesday in Ottawa\n\n\n\n13 hours ago\n\n\nNational News \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily reacts to arrest of man accused of killing Tina Fontaine\n\n\n\n13 hours ago\n\n\nNational News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPages \nAbout APTN InFocus\nAbout APTN Investigates\nAbout APTN National News\nAbout Face to Face\nAbout Nation to Nation\nAbout The Laughing Drum\nAPTN Investigates Full Episodes\nLive Stream\nNewscasts\nSend Your Comments\n\n \n\n Recent Stories \n\nMMIW advocate says threats against Alberta Premier Notley unacceptable\n\n\nSaskatoon program helps young people get out of gangs, off streets\n\n\nTRC set to release final report Tuesday in Ottawa\n\n\nFamily reacts to arrest of man accused of killing Tina Fontaine\n\n\nQuebec native women\u2019s association files own report on #mmiw in province\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t \u00a9 2015.

(WINNIPEG POLICE DEPARTMENT)\nCormier, 56, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder.\nTina\u2019s body, wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down with rocks, was found eight days after she was reported missing in August 2014.\nHer death reignited calls for the national inquiry, that is now holding cross-country hearings led by Buller.\nManitoba Chief Justice Glenn Joyal spent three hours Wednesday instructing the jury on key issues in the case and how to come to a decision.\nHe explained that there are only two questions that the jurors need answer.\n\u201cUnless you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt the Crown has proved that Tina Fontaine\u2019s death was caused by an unlawful act, and that the accused Raymond Cormier committed the unlawful act, you must find Raymond Cormier not guilty of second-degree murder. Your deliberations will be over,\u201d Joyal said.\n\u201cIf you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt Raymond Cormier committed the unlawful act that caused the death of Tina Fontaine, you must find Raymond Cormier guilty of second-degree murder as charged.\u201d\nThe jury has heard that Tina was raised by her great-aunt on the Sagkeeng First Nation, 120 kilometres north of Winnipeg, but went to the city to visit her mother. It was there that the girl became an exploited youth.\nCourt was told there were no witnesses to Tina\u2019s death and no DNA linking her to the accused. Experts testified they don\u2019t know how she died.\nCrown prosecutors said the teen was killed and dumped in the river by Cormier, who had sex with her and later found out she was a minor.\n\u00a0\nJoyal urged the jurors to listen to each other while discussing the case.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe jury\u2019s decision is a group decision. Everyone has a say and an equal say. Your duty is to consult with each other. The verdict must be based on the facts as you find them,\u201d he said.\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

After Harper\u2019s defeat the Conservative opposition surprised many by announcing recently they support an inquiry.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very pleased to have the leader of the Opposition on side now,\u201d said Bennett.\nTuesday\u2019s announcement follows Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s campaign promise of an inquiry into the nearly 1,200 missing and murdered Indigenous women over the last three decades.\nThe three ministers will hear from families across the country then meet with Aboriginal organizations, leaders and provinces to hear what they want the inquiry to look like.\n\u201cWe are already getting lot\u2019s of advice. We have committed to listening to families first,\u201d said Bennett. \nStarting with families is a sign of respect said Nishnawbe Aski Nation Deputy Grand Chief Anna Betty Achneepineskum.\n\u201cThe families must be comfortable with the inquiry as it unfolds and be able to participate at every step along the way,\u201d said Achneepineskum in a statement. \u201cWe acknowledge their grief and know that this will be a difficult and painful process. We are prepared to participle in a process where the families are well supported, the appropriate resources are in place and the right people are at the table.\u201d\nFollowing those meetings, Bennett, Wilson-Raybould and Hajdu will sit down and develop the scope of the inquiry that they hope\u00a0to announce next spring.\nThe second phase is the actual inquiry. \n\u201cNo inquiry can undo what happened, nor can it restore what was lost, but it can help us find a way forward,\u201d said Wilson-Raybould.\nFamilies\u00a0have already\u00a0told the ministers that they hope the inquiry stops another family from feeling the pain they do.\nThe Trudeau government\u2019s approach to the issue is night and day compared to Harper\u2019s.\u00a0During his time in office\u00a0almost 300 Indigenous women were found murdered, died under suspicious circumstances or went missing. Funding to the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada was also slashed year after year, as reported by APTN in September in this story.\nCanadians can also play a role in the first phase of the inquiry, said Bennett.\n\u201cThere will be an online component to this process.\u00a0This will include a website that includes background information that can help all Canadians better understand this issue.\u00a0It will also include an online survey and discussion guide available in the coming weeks,\u201d said Bennett.\u00a0\u201cThe discussion guide will help focus meetings by highlighting important elements and key questions about the inquiry\u2019s design.\u00a0The online survey echoes three \u2013 these questions and will provide access to all concerned Canadians.\u201d\nHajdu said Indigenous women represent four percent of the female population and yet 16 per cent of all murdered women in Canada.\n\u201cOver the years, many studies have attempted to explain these disparities,\u201d she said. \u201cSome have linked this violence to the long-term impacts of racism, sexism, colonialism and the devastating impacts of residential schools on Indigenous men, women and communities.\u201d\nShe said a range of socioeconomic and health challenges such as poverty, unemployment, lack of transportation, mental health and substance use issues also contribute.\n\u201cIndigenous women continue to live in poorer socioeconomic conditions than non-Indigenous women, which means that they\u2019re at a heightened risk of experiencing violence,\u201d said Hajdu. \u201cThat\u2019s why family members and loved ones of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls will be at the centre of this process. National Aboriginal organizations, provinces and territories and Indigenous women\u2019s organizations, along with representatives from a range of frontline service workers will also be essential voices. We will make sure that they can be heard.\u201d\nnews@aptn.ca\n@aptnnews\n\u00a0\n\n\nTags: Featured, mmiw, Ottawa\n\n\n\nAPTN National News\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tView all posts by APTN National News \u2192 \n\n\n\n\nWatch Prime Minister Trudeau\u2019s address to the AFN\u2019s Special Chiefs Assembly here\nManitoba chiefs\u2019 organization says Indigenous women face discrimination from cabbies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarol Anne Knapp\n\n\n\nPlease stop calling it the Trudeau government, it is the Government of Canada.

But each of them represents so much more \u2014 lives cruelly interrupted, dreams unfulfilled, families left to grieve and look for answers that\u00a0for too many\u00a0never came.\nEven so, the former government never saw the need for a national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women, insisting it was a criminal matter and that police had solved most of the cases.\nTheir political opponents took the opposite view. And committing to establish a national inquiry into murdered and missing indigenous women was a cornerstone of the Liberal campaign pledge to renew the relationship between the federal government and this country\u2019s first peoples.\n\u201cWe will immediately launch a national public inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women and girls in Canada,\u201d the platform reads, \u201cto seek recommendations on concrete actions that governments, law enforcement, and others can take to solve these crimes and prevent future ones.\u201d\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau restated the commitment shortly after his government was sworn into office in a speech to the Assembly of First Nations in December.\n\u201cWe have made this a priority for our government because those touched by this national tragedy have waited long enough,\u201d he told delegates. \u201cThe victims deserve justice, their families an opportunity to be heard and to heal.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no question that indigenous women are over-represented among homicide cases. While they make up about four per cent of the female population in this country, indigenous women represent 16 per cent of the women killed in homicides\nA 2014 report by the RCMP put the number of missing and murdered indigenous women at roughly 1,200: 1,017 were believed killed, another 164 were considered missing.\nIt also said close to 90 per cent of all female homicide cases are solved, and that little difference exists between solving cases of indigenous and non-indigenous victims.\nNumbers rejected\nThose numbers have been rejected by indigenous groups. They insist the number of victims\u00a0and the number of unsolved cases involving indigenous women are far higher than police and the former Conservative government claimed.\nThe three cabinet ministers in charge of drafting the mandate for the promised inquiry have heard the message.\nIndigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and Status of Women Minister Patty Hajdu criss-crossed the country over the past three months to hear from indigenous groups, families who have lost loved ones, women who have survived assault and attempted abductions.\nThat pre-inquiry work wrapped up last week, leaving Bennett and her colleagues convinced that the numbers are much higher, possibly as many as 4,000, even though there is no hard evidence to support it.\n\u201cWe have heard enough stories to hear that if you count these deaths, that were called a suicide or other things, we have anecdotal evidence that the problem is greater,\u201d Bennett told reporters.\n\u201cWe\u2019re saying that the issue that has been described as missing and murdered indigenous women is a tragedy that is much greater than that.\u201d\nThe government earmarked $40\u00a0million, an amount Bennett described to CBC News this weekend as \u201denough to get the inquiry going.\u201d\nThe final tally will depend on the exact mandate to be given to the still\u00a0unnamed commissioners, and just how far they need to go to come up with recommendations about addressing the number of cold cases and the conditions that make indigenous women more vulnerable than the rest of the population.\nTrudeau has said no relationship is more important to him than the one between indigenous people and his government.\nNo promise is likely to be more important in reaching that goal than delivering \u2014 fully\u00a0\u2014 on the promised inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women.(\u00a0Chris Hall)\nLink:\u00a0http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mmiw-trudeau-tracker-election-1.3460926\n\n\nYou may also like:\n\n\nJustin Trudeau justifies refugee delay, saying Liberals want to \u2018get it right\u2019 \u2013 CBC News\n\nJustin Trudeau defends taxpayer-financed nannies \u2013 CBC News\n\nTaxing sugary drinks could help cut consumption, researchers say \u2013 CBC News\n\nJustin Trudeau blames Conservatives for \u2018politicized\u2019 NEB process, won\u2019t rush Energy East \u2013 CBC News\n\nISIS strategy on agenda as Canada meets NATO allies \u2013 The Star\n\nPower for sex?

The city sits at the eastern end of an area that became an emblem of the killings and disappearances that gave rise to the inquiry in the first place.Mary Teegee responds to concerns about cancelled bus transportation along the Highway of Tears at a Carrier Sekani Family Services meeting in September 2017. Teegee said the MMIWG inquiry has been a \u201clogistical nightmare.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0(Twitter)Chief commissioner Marion Buller, centre, said despite the lack of response from Ottawa on the inquiry\u2019s request for an extension, its work continues. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of a pause to wait for the government to get back to us,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u00a0(JONATHAN HAYWARD / THE CANADIAN PRESS)Melanie Omeniho, president of Women of the M\u00e9tis Nation, said a lack of communication and outreach from the inquiry has left M\u00e9tis families feeling disregarded by the process.But in January, Teegee learned the inquiry would hold only a \u201cstatement gathering\u201d session in Prince George. None of the commissioners would be there, and participants would tell the stories of their loved ones in private, without the option of speaking in an open setting, as has been done at the inquiry\u2019s larger hearings elsewhere in B.C. and across Canada.This decision had a personal impact for Teegee, whose 16-year-old cousin, Ramona Wilson, went missing in June 1994 and was found murdered 10 months later. Not only that, but as executive director of Carrier Sekani Family Services, she was asked to help organize the Prince George session. She was given less than two weeks\u2019 notice to do so \u2014 hardly enough time to spread the word to families or book a venue, she said. \u201cWe got told at the 11th hour to assist them,\u201d Teegee said. \u201cWe did the best that we could.\u201dArticle Continued BelowPoor communication, organization that came off as clumsy or insensitive \u2014 the situation was in some ways representative of the broader narrative that has enveloped the national inquiry since its first public hearings were delayed in the fall of 2017. That initial holdup was coupled with a series of high-profile staff departures that have included one of the inquiry\u2019s five commissioners, a succession of executive directors, the inquiry\u2019s lead lawyer, and more.For Teegee, it all contributed to her sense that the process \u2014 so important to those who, like her, had pushed for years for an inquiry into the \u201cnational tragedy\u201d of missing and murdered Indigenous women \u2014 has been bungled from the start. \u201cI think the inquiry is a logistical nightmare,\u201d she said. Now, after almost two years of criticism and administrative setbacks, the national inquiry has arrived at a key juncture. In early March, chief commissioner Marion Buller asked for two more years and another $50 million \u2014 on top of the original $54-million budget \u2014 to complete the work. The four remaining commissioners are now steering the inquiry into a new phase of expert hearings and research, even as they plod toward a deadline they no longer wish to meet, waiting for the government to rule on the request for more time and money. The legacy of the entire process \u2014 not to mention the credibility of Justin Trudeau\u2019s quest for reconciliation in Canada \u2014 may well hinge on the answer.\u201cWe have to do it right. We can\u2019t do a superficial examination,\u201d Buller told the Star in a recent interview, describing the \u201csacred responsibility\u201d of the inquiry to address the systemic causes of violence against Indigenous women and girls, in memory of the hundreds \u2014 and perhaps thousands \u2014 who have died or gone missing in recent decades. \u201cIn my view, to do anything less than that would not do honour to those people,\u201d she said. And yet, two months after asking Ottawa for more time and money, Buller said she has heard \u201cnothing\u201d from the Liberal government. The inquiry has also received no official responses to its interim report, published in November, which included calls on the federal government and the provinces to create a special police task force to address unsolved cases, provide funding to ensure families can participate in the inquiry \u2014 a frequent demand of critics \u2014 and expand a special mental health program to meet needs stirred up by the process. Article Continued Below\u201cWe made recommendations for funding for programming for healing that we\u2019re seeing is time-sensitive and very critical,\u201d Buller said.But in the absence of an answer on the extension, the inquiry must \u201cpress on,\u201d she said, describing how expert hearings on human rights have started in Quebec City, and will continue with sessions on government services, racism and policing until late June. Buller said the inquiry\u2019s forensic review team is preparing to start its audit of police files on specific cases, and that work on the final report is also underway, with a view to finishing a first draft in August \u2014 just three months from now. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of a pause to wait for the government to get back to us,\u201d Buller said. In her own interview with the Star, federal Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett said Thursday that a decision on an extension will be announced \u201cwithin a week or two.\u201d She added that an official response to the interim report is in the works as well, and that she hopes to provide information on which recommendations the government plans to fulfil at the same time as it releases a decision on the extension. \u201cThe issue (is what are) the concrete measures and actions that it will take to keep women safe in their communities,\u201d she said. \u201cThat still is the goal.\u201dYet some Indigenous leaders don\u2019t think the process is worth more time and money. Sheila North, grand chief of the Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak, said many of those who pushed for a public inquiry now feel a made-in-Ottawa process was imposed on them without enough consultation. \u201cPeople started feeling disrespected and disregarded,\u201d North said, explaining how there was \u201clittle or sometimes no information at all\u201d about when hearings would take place, or co-ordination about how to access \u201cafter-care\u201d for people retraumatized through their participation in the process. Others were put off by the original inquiry format, something that could have been avoided through more consultation with Indigenous groups in different regions, North said. For example, some who came to testify at the inquiry hearing in Winnipeg in October felt the process was set up like a courtroom.\u201cPeople were expecting an environment where they can feel comfortable, and feel they are telling a story to people that care,\u201d she said. Melanie Omeniho, president of Women of the M\u00e9tis Nation, said the lack of communication and outreach from the inquiry has left M\u00e9tis families feeling disregarded by the process, and that some gestures of accommodation \u2014 such as when the inquiry invited fiddlers and dancers to perform at a hearing in Richmond, B.C., at the last minute, she said \u2014 came across as superficial and offensive.Instead of an extension, Omeniho said work should begin immediately on implementing changes that have already been called for, such as reforms to police and justice systems, and filling gaps in statistics on missing and murdered M\u00e9tis women and girls. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have the respect to ask the families that tried to engage with them if they were M\u00e9tis,\u201d Omeniho said. \u201cThe trauma keeps increasing and there\u2019s no followup for them.\u201dSimilar criticisms were outlined in a scathing inquiry report card published this month by the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada. Francyne Joe, the association\u2019s executive director, said she sees two main problems with how the inquiry has unfolded: the scope of its mandate \u2014 to analyze \u201csystemic violence\u201d against Indigenous women and girls \u2014 is too wide and undefined, and the administration has been slow and uncommunicative.But even so, Joe supports the extension for the inquiry, with caveats like a more transparent budget and improved co-operation with community groups. \u201cWe just want to ensure that at the end of the day, this report that comes out is going to be a substantial and effective report that\u2019s going to make a difference for our women,\u201d she said. Buller, meanwhile, acknowledged the inquiry has its shortcomings, but said improvements have been made to ensure the process is respectful, and that participating families are supported in travelling to and from hearings. Now it\u2019s just a matter of striving toward a final report that \u2014 unlike most calls for action from so many previous inquiries and reports \u2014 results in concrete change, she said. \u201cWe want to keep this work moving,\u201d Buller said. The big question now is whether the federal government does, too.TOP STORIES, DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX.NEW NEWSLETTERHEADLINESSIGN UPMore from The Star & PartnersLOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

The long-awaited inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women has publicly released its findings including calls for health service providers to develop education programs for Indigenous children and youth on the issue of grooming for exploitation. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGATINEAU, Que. \u2014 Geraldine Gauthier clutched a picture of her sister, Lynn, as she heard from the federally funded commission tasked with documenting the causes of violence against Indigenous women and girls.\nLynn was murdered 19 years ago. For Gauthier, the day was emotional and brought back many memories. But it was also filled with a touch of optimism now that 231 recommendations from the inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls have been put on paper.\n\n\n\n   article continues below \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\nTelus to extend fibre optic network to city households\nAlert bystander aids in capture of suspected criminal\nP.G. woman ranked Top 100 in Maxim cover girl contest\nMLA still working on bill to ban glysophate from B.C. forests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrelated\n\n'Now the real work begins:' Families call for action after inquiry report\nSome of the MMIWG inquiry's furthest-reaching recommendations\n\n\n\n\"They are going to hear what we have to say, first of all,\" she said. \"It is a beginning and I hope it does bring change.\"\nSpeaking in the grand hall of the Canadian Museum of History, facing Parliament Hill across the Ottawa River, the inquiry's chief commissioner, Marion Buller, said that nothing short of an absolute paradigm-shift is in order from all levels of government and public institutions to address the issue \u2014 one her commission labelled frankly as a genocide. \n\nThe tragedy, Buller said, is a direct result of a \"persistent and deliberate pattern of systemic racial and gendered human and Indigenous rights violations and abuses, perpetuated historically and maintained today by the Canadian state.\"\nThe term has instantly become a flashpoint, the subject of arguments over whether it denotes intentionality in the hundreds of killings and disappearances the inquiry examined, whether it's fair if it does, whether the label matters.\nFor his part, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stopped short of using the term \u2014 despite being directly asked to do so in a call from the crowd \u2014 when he spoke after accepting the report.\nInstead, Trudeau said violence against Indigenous women and girls is \"not a relic of Canada's past,\" but part of its present, and the justice system has failed them.\n\"Time and again, we have heard of their disappearance, violence, or even death being labelled low priority or ignored,\" he said.\nHe received the report from the commissioners after they performed a traditional ceremony, including coating its pages with medicine.\nIn a speech later in Vancouver to a gender equality conference with numerous political leaders from around the world, Trudeau did use the term.\n\"Earlier this morning the national inquiry formally presented their final report in which they found that the tragic violence that Indigenous women and girls have experienced amounts to genocide.\"\nThe inquiry report itself uses the term \"genocide\" dozens of times, starting in the first paragraph of Buller's preface: \"This report is about deliberate race, identity and gender-based genocide,\" she wrote.\nAfter Monday's ceremony, Buller said the commission does not need to hear the word \"genocide\" out of Trudeau's mouth; it heard the truth from families and survivors. That Indigenous women and girls have been victims of genocide was an \"inescapable conclusion\" for the commission, she said.\nWhen asked if she agreed with the use of the term, Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett said the Liberal government accepts the findings of the commissioners, adding it has heard for a long time that \"racism and sexism kills.\"\nThe federal government will leave the discussion of the use of the term \"genocide\" to academics and experts, said Justice Minister David Lametti. He said the government has a responsibility to the families and survivors to fix the problem.\nConservative Indigenous-affairs critic Cathy McLeod said the discussion around the term was a distraction from the value of the report's findings and would not say whether she agreed with the use of the word.\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said he thinks genocide is an accurate word to use for what he calls \"a complete system failure\" for Indigenous women and girls.\nMonday, Buller told the crowd she and her three fellow commissioners are holding up a mirror to the country, reflecting what they heard from more than 2,300 people over two years of cross-country public hearings and work to gather evidence.\nCommissioner Qajaq Robinson said the inquiry tested her to her core as a non-Indigenous person, struggling to come to terms with her \"role in Canada's genocide.\"\n\"Shame, guilt, denial, that urge to say, 'No, no, no, that's not what this is,' \" she said. \"But it's the truth. It's our truth. It's my truth, it's your truth. The families, survivors, and Indigenous peoples across this country have brought this truth to light.\"\n(Robinson was born and raised in Nunavut, speaks Inuktitut and practises Aboriginal law, but her appointment as a member of a commission that had no Inuk member was questioned when the inquiry began.)\nThe report's 231 recommendations \u2014 framed as \"calls for justice\" \u2014 include developing an effective response to human-trafficking cases and sexual exploitation and violence, including in the sex industry.\nThese moves are not optional, but constitute legal imperatives, the report says.\nAdditional calls include establishing a national Indigenous- and human-rights ombudsperson and a national Indigenous- and human-rights tribunal.\nThe report also focuses on a call for people in the justice system and in police services to acknowledge that the historical and current relationship with Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people has been largely defined by colonialism, racism, bias and discrimination.\nMissing and murdered Indigenous women are believed to number in the thousands in Canada, but the report says that despite the commission's best efforts to quantify the extent of the tragedy, \"no one knows an exact number.\"\nIn 2005, the Native Women's Association of Canada created a database tracking cases and produced a 2010 report documenting 582 missing and murdered Indigenous women. In 2014, the RCMP released a national overview and pegged the number of cases between 1980 and 2012 at nearly 1,200. Other unverified estimates are far higher.\nEvelyne Youngchief, a survivor of violence who works on the front lines on the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, said Monday the report may offer closure to some, but not her.\nMore and more Indigenous women continue to go missing and be murdered, she said.\n\"It's going to keep happening,\" she said. \"It's not going to end any time soon. When are they going to stop murdering and taking our women?\"\n\u2014Follow @kkirkup on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Related Topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright  Prince George Citizen\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail this article to a Friend\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Email Address: *\n\nYour Name: *\n\nTo Email Address: *\n\n* Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.\n\n\nMessage: *\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nnext\nCanada's oldest woman dies at 114, 'serene, content, grateful and positive'\n\n\n\n\n\u203a\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nCanada's oldest woman dies at 114, 'serene, content, ...\n\n\nnext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID tagging garbage cans POLL\nAre you in favour of the city adding radio frequency identification tags to garbage cans?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, because it will improve service \n\n\n\n\n\n No, because the service is fine already \n\n\n\n\n\nYes, because it will reduce costs \n\n\n\n\n\nNo, because local gov't shouldn\u2019t be monitoring when I put my garbage can out or what I put in it\n\n\n\n or \n                \u00a0view results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up For Our e-Newsletter!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the latest news right in your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCity Matters\n\nYour City Matters - City of Prince George\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n97/16\n\nPrince George's Weekly News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPick up the 97/16 and Flyers\n\n\nClick here to see where you can pick up a copy of the Citizen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the North\n\n2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth and Development\n\nGrowth & Development 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfiles of Excellence - 2019\n\nPrince George\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGATEWAY TO THE NORTH\n\nMay 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Citizen\n\n\nYou Might Like\nMost Read\nMost Recent\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelus to extend fibre optic network to city households\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlert bystander aids in capture of suspected criminal\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.G. woman ranked Top 100 in Maxim cover girl contest\n\nJune 3, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMLA still working on bill to ban glysophate from B.C. forests\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorthern woman is Maxim cover girl finalist\n\nJune 4, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCougars, city sign six-year lease extension\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCostco search of man\u2019s backpack not sexual discrimination: tribunal\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMikhalchuk knocks the stuffing out of Royals\n\nDecember 2, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoor conditions at care home\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave gas, quit idling\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRally calls for ban on logging old growth\n\nJune 7, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you part of something bigger?\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFundraiser being held for local skier\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoor conditions at care home\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave gas, quit idling\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing rules are more restrictive for cannabis than for tobacco\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanada a global cannabis leader\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nSpruce Capital meet returns to Masich Place Stadium\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerry Wilson soccer tournament at Rotary Friday\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCougars, city sign six-year lease extension\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Event Calendar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out what's happening in your community and submit your own local events.\n\n\n\n\nAdd an event\n\n\n\n\nSee all community events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLowest Gas Prices in\u00a0Prince George\n\n\nPrince George Gas Prices\u00a0provided by GasBuddy.com\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up For Our Newsletter!\n\n\n\n\n\tHave the Prince George Citizen delivered to your inbox or your home each day - subscribe now!

chief commissioner, B.C.\u2019s first female First Nations judge\nMichele Audette; former president of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada\nQajaq Robinson; An Ottawa-based, Nunavut-born lawyer who practices civil litigation with an emphasis on aboriginal law\nMarilyn Poitras; a professor at the University of Saskatchewan professor with a focus on indigenous law\nBrian Eyolfson; First Nations lawyer based in Ontario\n\nUnder the Inquiries Act, the commissioners will have the same powers as any court in a civil case to enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give evidence.\nThey may also examine all papers, documents, vouchers, records and books belonging a public office or institution.\nThe launch of the inquiry shows the government is committed to honouring the lives of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls, Wilson-Raybould said Wednesday.\nThe minister has an intimate knowledge of the issue as a former B.C. regional chief for the Assembly of First Nations.\nBy examining root causes including past and present systemic and institutional barriers the commission will play a key role in defining actions needed to protect the human rights of indigenous women and girls, she added.\nThe government said Wednesday that family information liaison units will provide centralized resources for families of missing or murdered indigenous women and girls and gather information during the inquiry process.\nIn May 2014, the RCMP released a report documenting 1,181 murdered and missing women between 1980 and 2012.\nA year later, it said 32 aboriginal women had been murdered and 11 more had disappeared since it first reported on the issue.\nThe RCMP also noted there is an \u201cunmistakable connection between homicide and family violence.\u201d\nThe force said the relationship between victim and offender was particularly relevant because more than 90 per cent of the women in the homicide data were known to the offender.\nMistrust toward police forces and the need to examine officer conduct is also expected to be a central theme of the inquiry process.\nIt\u2019s expected to be a highly emotional day for a number of advocates who have repeatedly called on Ottawa to open a national inquiry into the issue, but were long denied by the former Harper Conservative government\n(The Canadian Press)\n \n\n\n\n\n\nComments are closed.\n\n\nLatest\n\nMore\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nRecently Played\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nLast Played\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarryl Worley\nAwful Beautiful Life\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2 Minutes Ago\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJess Moskaluke\nElevator\n\n\t\t\t\t\t5 Minutes Ago\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohner Brothers\nMaybe She'll Change Her ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t10 Minutes Ago\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsay Ell\nBy the Way\n\n\t\t\t\t\t13 Minutes Ago\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrevor Panczak\nI Can Be the Lover\n\n\t\t\t\t\t16 Minutes Ago\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCurrent Weather\n\n  \n\n\n\nRegina, Saskatchewan, Canada\n16\u00b0C Sunny\n\nPowered by World Weather Online \n\n\nDaily Poll\n\n  \n\nIs Flossing your teeth a regular part of your dental health\n\nAll the timeOccasionalI have dentures!\n\nView Results\nVoting ends: Aug. 4, 2016 @ 5:30 AM\n\n\n \n\n\nPoll sponsored by Stone Ridge Realty\n\n  \n\n\nFarm Fresh Song\n\n\n\tFarm Fresh Song sponsored by\n\tLine-X\n\n\n  \n\n\nRegina Traffic\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWhat's New?\n\n  \n\n\nPolice arrest two women in stolen vehicle incident \n\n\n4 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n107 Views\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30 year old man from Muskoday first nation killed in traffic accident\n\n\n5 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44 Views\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaskatchewan man charged with uttering threats against Trudeau\n\n\n6 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n264 Views\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPremier Wall: More testing needed on North Saskatchewan River\n\n\n7 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16 Views\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing grain prices Wednesday Aug 3\n\n\n7 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 Views\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent samples from Husky oil spill show water within Canadian drinking water guidelines\n\n\n7 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25 Views\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaskatchewan Rural Municipalities want Churchill open to grain shipments\n\n\n9 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60 Views\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Gloria) Rally Cap!\n\n\n9 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Views\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsettled weather forecast for southern Saskatchewan\n\n\n9 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n59 Views\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFLEA - Wednesday August 3rd, 2016\n\n\n9 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 Views\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdvertise With UsContact UsStock ImagesPrivacy PolicyTerms Of Service \n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016.

The policy that clearly targeted women, seen as the carriers of the Algerian culture, was accompanied on the ground by tanks and artillery targeting men. It was only in 1962, that Algeria gained its independence from France, after a long, brutal and violent war.\nThis week, in Ottawa, the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, submitted its long-awaited report. Years ago, already, in 2004, Amnesty International Canada called the disappeared and murdered Indigenous women, the \"Stolen Sisters.\"\nIn 2012, the RCMP reported the number of Indigenous women and girls who disappeared or were murdered as 1,182.\nThe new report speaks of thousands of women with a similar fate. Unfortunately, we will never know exactly how many. As if neither the lives nor the tragic deaths of these women and girls really mattered. Many other women were probably murdered and killed with no one reporting their disappearance, or worse, their disappearances were probably hidden.\nThe inquiry found that Indigenous women and girls are \"12 times more likely to be murdered or to go missing than members of any other demographic group in Canada and 16 times more likely to be slain or disappear than white women.\"\nDespite the cultural and geographic differences between Algerian women and Indigenous women, both groups were victims of brutal and ruthless colonialist administration. The French in the case of Algerian women, and the Canadian in the case of Indigenous women. Both were abused by police officers; both have seen their native languages banned from being taught at homes and in schools and both were targeted as they were seen as the heart of the Algerian and Indigenous family, respectively.\nUnder the pretext of liberating women from the oppression of their male relatives and pretending to welcome them into the world of civilization and legal rights, many Algerian women were forced to remove their veils. Their religion, Islam, was identified by the French colonialist institutions as the main source of their oppression and backwardness. Many Algerians grew up not learning Arabic, or being ashamed of speaking it.\nIn the case of Indigenous women, many who were fleeing domestic violence from some men in their communities (another product of colonialism and difficult economic factors) were taken advantage of by either police officers or on the road by white men who would sexually abuse them and then would kill them. Many Indigenous women would be described as \"loose\" or \"drug addicts\" or \"submissive\" so according to this highly biased and discriminating description, who would be bothered by their deaths anyway?\nIn the case of Algeria, up to today France has never admitted its war crimes in Algeria. The word genocide was never pronounced by any French politicians. The closest French politicians came was admitting to the killing and torture of Maurice Audin, a French communist who was supporting the fight for independence.\nToday, Canada has a choice. It can continue to look away and praise itself as one of the best places in the world and quietly put the report on the shelf like it has in the past for all the previous reports (the Royal commission on Aboriginal peoples, and the public commission of inquiry into missing women in B.C. in 2012).\nOr, it can decide to be courageous and brave and start decolonizing its institutions starting from stopping the abusive and racial profiling practices used by some local police forces, to overcoming the general apathy and complacency of the RCMP, to repealing the mother of all evil, the Indian Act.\nLike any radical change, this decolonization process wouldn't be easy or popular to adopt. Already, most of the major newspapers in Canada are, since the release of the report, aligning with editorial after editorial and opinion after opinion against the word \"genocide\" used in the report. Many have been acting offended and choosing to focus on the word genocide,\u00a0while all the crucial issues discussed in the report have seemed already to be once again forgotten. \u00a0\nMonia Mazigh was born and raised in Tunisia and immigrated to Canada in 1991.

CONTRIBUTED/DESTINATION MEMBERTOU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nA\n\n\n\n\nSince 1996, National Indigenous Peoples Day is celebrated every year on June 21. On this day, all Canadians are invited to recognize and celebrate the unique heritage, diverse cultures and outstanding contributions of Indigenous people. The day coincides closely with the summer solstice, an occasion that's culturally significant for many Indigenous peoples.\nWho are Canada's Indigenous peoples?\nThe Constitution recognizes three distinct Indigenous groups: First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis. The predominant group south of the Arctic is First Nations, a category that comprises 634 separate bands speaking more than 50 distinct languages. Inuit groups traditionally occupy the northern regions of Canada. There are eight major Inuit ethnic groups and five main Inuit dialects. The M\u00e9tis are the descendants of First Nations women who were married to European colonizers and who, over time, developed their own distinct culture and language. All in all, there are more than 1.4 million Indigenous people living in Canada.\nContributions to war efforts\nIn the War of 1812, thousands of First Nations and M\u00e9tis warriors fought alongside the British to defend territories from invading American forces. Indigenous people were also instrumental in Canadian-fought battles in both world wars, and more than 500 lost their lives defending the principles of democracy, freedom and equality. Numerous Indigenous individuals volunteered in both war efforts and many were awarded medals for their meaningful contributions.\nNotable contributions\nIn media, music, literature, education, sports, science, business and the arts, Indigenous people have contributed hugely to Canadian culture. Perhaps the greatest contribution of all, though, is the very land itself which was transferred from Indigenous control to Canadian control within the treaty process that occurred in the 19th century.\nIndigenous milestones\nJUNE 16, 2010\nFirst National Truth and Reconciliation event\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada hosts its first national event in Winnipeg. It explored the history of the residential school system, the experience of former students and their families and the impact such institutions had on Indigenous peoples in Canada.\nNOV. 1, 2012\nIdle No More movement begins\nFour women start Idle No More as a national (and online) movement of marches and teach-ins, raising awareness of Indigenous rights and advocating for self-determination.\nDEC. 15, 2015\nFinal Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission released\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission releases its final report, \u201cHonouring the Truth, Reconciling for the Future.\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who attended the ceremonial release of the report, commits his government to implementing all the 94 recommendations set out in the June 2015 summary report.\nAPRIL 14, 2016\nSupreme Court ruling changes legal definition of \u201cIndian\u201d\nThe Supreme Court of Canada ruled unanimously that the legal definition of \u201cIndian\u201d \u2014 as laid out in the Constitution \u2014 includes the M\u00e9tis and non-status Indians. This ruling will facilitate possible negotiations over traditional land rights, access to education and health programs and other government services.\nAUG. 28, 2017\nFederal government pledges to scrap Indian Act\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the division of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada into two departments, naming Jane Philpott minister of Indigenous Services and Carolyn Bennett minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs. Bennett was given the long-term task of ending the Indian Act and transferring certain government powers back to Indigenous peoples.\nOCT. 6, 2017\nSixties Scoop survivors receive settlement\nThe federal government announced a settlement of $800 million with Sixties Scoop survivors. The Sixties Scoop refers to the forced removal of Indigenous children from their homes and their subsequent adoption into predominantly non-Indigenous, middle-class families across Canada and the United States in the 1960s. Survivors of these federal and provincial government policies experienced lasting trauma as a result of their separation from their birth families, communities and cultures.\nJUNE 3, 2019\nFinal Report of the National Inquiry into MMIWG released\nThe final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls reveals that persistent and deliberate human rights violations are the source of Canada\u2019s staggering rates of violence against Indigenous women, girls and LGBTQ2S people. The report gives 231 calls for justice to governments, police forces and institutions.\n\nSource: thecanadianencyclopedia.ca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid this story inform or enhance your perspective on

A wide-ranging poll released Friday by Nanos Research finds, among other things, that Canadians are three times more likely to say their country has done a poor job of curtailing the deaths and disappearances than to praise the work it has done federally to stop the bloodshed. That survey is available at www.nwac.ca along with documents related to NWAC\u2019s annual Scorecard.\nWhen the National Action Plan was released, NWAC dismissed it as \u201can aspirational document with no funding, timelines, or measurable goals.\u201d\nThe federal budget of 2021 directed $2.2 billion over five years to address the genocide against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people. But the commitments outlined in the plan were not separately costed, and there is little information to show how those funds are being distributed and what concrete action is being achieved.\n\u201cToday, we are seeing the sad results of the government\u2019s weak response to the crimes being committed against Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse people,\u201d said Lynne Groulx, NWAC\u2019s CEO.\n\u201cThe National Action Plan, as it was drafted, was actually a recipe for inaction, and the people represented by our organization are paying the price.\u201d\nJust prior to the release of the National Action Plan, NWAC made public its own fully costed plan entitled Our Calls, Our Actions to outline how the association would address the Inquiry\u2019s Calls for Justice. NWAC is pleased to announce that it has fully completed 40 of the 66 actions contained in that plan and has made progress on an additional 18.\nOver the past year, NWAC introduced 16 different projects or programs aimed at reducing violence against Indigenous women, girls, and gender diverse people. Many were delivered through the creation of the Resiliency Lodges that are now operating in two provinces and are being developed in others.\nAt the same time, NWAC established three separate accountability mechanisms to oversee its achievements and to highlight what has left to be done.\n\u201cThese are things that we have implemented because we simply cannot stand by and do nothing while our mothers, daughters, sisters and aunties are being taken from us,\u201d said Ms. Groulx. \u201cWe fully understand the urgency, even if those who are in power do not.\u201d\nStatistics Canada said earlier this year that two thirds of First Nations and Metis women report having been physically or sexually assaulted since the age of 15 _ a rate that is significantly higher than that reported by non-Indigenous women.\nBetween 2015 and 2020 (the most recent year for which numbers are available), Indigenous women accounted for 24 per cent of all female homicide victims in Canada, even though they make up just 5 per cent of the country\u2019s female population. There is nothing to suggest that those crimes are on the decline.\nIt is critical that action be taken to end this genocide, said Ms. Groulx. The Calls for Justice of the National Inquiry are legal imperatives, and their implementation is not optional, she said.\n\u201cIt is now three years since the National Inquiry set the path for ending the genocide,\u201d said Ms. Groulx. \u201cNWAC has travelled far in its efforts to stop the murders and disappearances.

My understanding is that it can and very likely will. What is happening to men and boys can be examined without taking away focus away from missing and murdered Indigenous women and it won\u2019t undermine the inquiry in any way.\u201d\nThe argument is that Indigenous men are facing a darker experience in terms of violence.\nAn RCMP report issued in 2014 revealed that more than a thousand Indigenous women have gone missing or have been murdered since the 1980\u2019s, a number far higher than what was expected.\nNo such study has been compiled by a police force in Canada for Indigenous men, but reported statistics show that 71 percent of Indigenous deaths in Canada during the same time period are of men.\n\u201cThe commissioners could order a report, or entertain families who have had a boy or man who have gone missing,\u201d said Crey. \u201cIf these families can come forward, the commissioners can listen to them. It will complete the picture and in the end whatever recommendations the commissioners come up with will be well rounded.\u201d\nnews@aptn.ca\n\n\nTags: Ernie Crey, Featured, In-Focus, Indigenous boys, indigenous men, mmiw, National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Violence\n\n\n\nAPTN National News\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tView all posts by APTN National News \u2192 \n\n\n\n\nNew leadership for the Southern Chiefs Organization\nIntellectual, activist, \u2018giant\u2019 Arthur Manuel sung out by family across the threshold to the other side\n\n\n\nNo comments yet.\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply \nYour email address will not be published.

She sure learned. \"It took probably 140 hours.\"\nShe, like all other contributors, \"feasted\" her work in to the installation, providing a meal and tobacco ceremonially before placing it among the rest.\nBut, she says, \"I couldn't partake,\" of the actual placing \u2014 she was too overcome. \nWalking With Our Sisters is, of course, so much more than an installation. It is a ceremony and sacred space, and before I walk my own way through it during a special media preview on Saturday, I remove my shoes and undergo a smudging, the sweet smoke wave up to my eyes, ears, mouth, heart to help me see, hear, feel the work in the best way and to talk about it.\nThe 1,800 vamps are laid out more or less along the design of a turtle body, with concentric circles near the middle, where stand two eagle staffs. The small vamps near the middle represent the missing and perished children of the residential school system.\nThere are cedar and pine boughs laid along the path, and at various points along the way there are stations \u2014 one a buffalo pelt, another a cattle skull with brass cups, and at the front a cut-out depiction of Sky Woman, smiling, with two geese.\nEverywhere in the space, from the carpeting with depictions of deer, wolf, beaver and so on to the amazing five-generation quilt at back (the work of Cathy Clause and her family), the elements of Native myth and spirituality, history and tradition powerfully mark the visitor's journey through the installation.\nThe vamps themselves, so numerous, are achingly poignant, full of motifs and symbols, images, baby footprint here, birth and death dates there, and designs from so many tradition, from the peace symbol to flower imagery.\nOff to one side is a table where Aileen Joseph sits by a picture of her daughter Shelley Lynne Joseph, Jan. 4, 1964 to July 2, 2004, killed in Hamilton.\n\"It is a way to remember,\" says Aileen of her presence there and of the installation as a whole. \"I have met a lot of the families (of missing and murdered Indigenous women).\"\nShe says of government inquiry into the issued, \"You feel so defeated sometimes.\"\nShe was there with her granddaughter, Shelley's daughter, Sheena Joseph.\nThis is a place all Canadians should come to, walk through, feel for themselves.\nWalking With Our Sisters is at The Gathering Place by The Grand, 2593 Chiefswood Rd., Ohsweken, from Nov. 19 to 25, 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and 5 to 8 p.m. with closing ceremony on Nov. 26 at noon. \nBefore visiting contact walkingwithoursisters6na@gmail.com and/or call 519-732-9941.\n jmahoney@thespec.com \n905-526-3306\n\n\n\n\n\nMahoney: At Six Nations, honouring steps unfinished\nArt instilation commemorates Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women\n\nNews\n04:33 PM\n\nby \nJeff Mahoney\n\n\nHamilton Spectator\n\n\n\nThey were failed, at so many levels, but they will not be forgotten.\nToo often devalued and disregarded in life, sometimes by the very institutions entrusted to protect them, the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women represent through the joined cost of their disappearance a failure, arguably, of our society as a whole.\nBut the keepers of their memories are not resting.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young  Six stories in the news for Monday, Oct. 15\t\t\t CANADIANS WIDELY UNAWARE OF WOMEN'S HISTORY: POLL\t\t\t The organization behind Canada's Heritage Minutes says provincial education systems need to do a better job of teaching students about the country's most historically significant women, pointing to a new poll that suggests the majority of Canadians have a lot to learn. The Ipsos poll conducted on behalf of Historica Canada posed a dozen true or false questions about Canadian women's history. And 55 per cent of those who took the quiz failed, with only three per cent answering well enough to score an A.\t\t\t FITNESS BUFFS TURN TO CANNABIS TO AID WORKOUTS\t\t\t As an avid runner with some two dozen marathons under his belt, Adrian Landini is thoroughly familiar with the runner's high. He's also quite experienced running while high. The longtime pot smoker routinely lights up during a run, saying it benefits his endurance training. Impending legalization Wednesday is lifting the veil around the unexpected ways weed has long been integrated into some users' lives. Among those are some fitness buffs keen to dispel the stereotype of the lazy stoner.\t\t\t    HALIFAX SMOKING BAN TO BEGIN TODAY\t\t\t Halifax's sweeping smoking ban begins today, two days before recreational cannabis is legalized across Canada. The ban in Nova Scotia's capital prohibits smoking or vaping of both nicotine and cannabis on municipal property, except within designated smoking areas. The city's map of designated smoking areas currently has nine spots posted, most of which are bus terminals. And people caught smoking outside those areas could face fines as high as $2,000.\t\t\t DONALD MACDONALD DEAD AT 86\t\t\t Longtime Liberal politician Donald Macdonald died on Sunday at the age of 86. His daughter Sonja Macdonald said he died in his sleep at his Toronto home. Macdonald, who was born in Ottawa, was elected to the House of Commons in 1962 and held a number of cabinet portfolios under Pierre Trudeau, including defence and finance. He was also president of the Privy Council and in 1994 was named a companion of the Order of Canada for his contributions to trade and social policy development.\t\t\t WIDOWER GETS \"OVERWHELMING\" AMOUNT OF CARDS\t\t\t Gerard Dunn has found an unexpected best friend in his local postman who makes daily house calls \u2014 sometimes with the help of a supervisor \u2014 to deliver an \"overwhelming\" torrent of cards for him to look through. His Sydney, N.S., home is packed with containers full of letters and cards after a tweet from his daughter went viral last month asking people to mail Gerard their best wishes for his 92nd birthday on Tuesday. It will be the first in a very long time that he'll be spending without his beloved wife, Ellen, who died in March.\t\t\t COUPLE RECREATES 'ALIEN' FOR MATERNITY PHOTOS\t\t\t In Ridley Scott's 1979 classic, \"Alien,\" the crew of the Nostromo begin a voyage unknowingly carrying a new being along with them. Thirty-nine years later, Todd and Nicole Cameron of Nanaimo, B.C., drew inspiration from the film to tell their friends and family that they too will soon embark on a voyage with a new being. On a rainy September day the eight-and-a-half month pregnant Nicole donned a chiffon dress and then, along with Todd, posed for photos in a pumpkin patch recreating the infamous alien birth scene from the movie.\t\t\t ALSO IN THE NEWS:\t\t\t \u2014 Re-trial for Dennis Oland on a charge of second-degree murder in the 2011 death of his father, Richard Oland in Saint John.\t\t\t \u2014 The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls will hold hearings in St. John's.\t\t\t \u2014 Canadian Real Estate Association releases latest housing data.\t\t\t \u2014 Invitation-only meeting in Toronto of the CEOs of the world's biggest corporations.

Photo, CP/Justin Tang.\nJohn Fox went to the family consultations and meetings in Toronto and Ottawa as the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls got underway. He sent in written recommendations. He phoned the 1-800 number for family members who want to\u00a0register to address the commission; he phoned it again and again, but each time, it went to voice mail. It was weeks before he got a call back; after several conversations with inquiry staff calls, he\u2019s still not sure his name is on the list.\nFox, a member of Wikwemikong First Nation on Ontario\u2019s Manitoulin Island, lost his daughter four years ago. Cheyenne Fox, a 20-year-old mother of one, fell to her death from the 24th\u00a0floor of a Toronto condo building in what her father believes was murder, though police say they have no evidence of criminal activity.\nAfter Cheyenne died, Fox\u00a0intensified his efforts in the decades-long fight for a national inquiry,\u00a0which was finally announced in October 2015,\u00a0to probe why indigenous women and girls are about five times more likely to vanish or die violently than their non-indigenous counterparts.\u00a0The RCMP report some 1,200 cases of unsolved homicides and disappearances across Canada; advocacy organizations put the number closer to 4,000. The inquiry commission will hold hearings across the country\u00a0before issuing\u00a0far-reaching recommendations for how to stop the ongoing crisis. The\u00a0final report\u00a0is due by the end of 2018.\nNow, not nine months after the inquiry officially began, Fox has given up on it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s in shambles,\u201d says Fox, who, together with fellow advocate and family member Jocelyn Wabano-Iahtail, spoke at a press conference on Parliament Hill last week to announce their intention to boycott the process ahead of the hearings beginning Tuesday.\u00a0Fox says protesters will gather at future inquiry meetings to air their grievances and warn other families against taking part.\u00a0\u201c[The inquiry] had the opportunity to do something right,\u201d he says. \u201cThey haven\u2019t done it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJohn Fox and his daughter Cheyenne\nWhile few have gone so far as to publicly call for a boycott, criticism of the inquiry has echoed across the country. In mid-May, more than 50 people, including family members, scholars and advocates, signed off on an open letter to the commission \u201craising alarms that the Inquiry is in serious trouble.\u201d Days later, hereditary chief Bill Wilson \u2014 a prominent indigenous leader in B.C. who happens to be the father of federal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould \u2014 called the inquiry \u201ca bloody farce\u201d in a widely circulated Facebook post. Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde issued a statement expressing support for families\u2019 frustrations and reiterating its call for better communication. And dozens of families have aired their concerns in national media.\nIn addition to charges of poor communication, many family members were bitterly disappointed to learn that the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference don\u2019t explicitly include an examination of policing, despite widespread concerns about the quality of some investigations and racism within police forces. The process, says Fox, has been bureaucratic, disrespectful of traditions and plagued by\u00a0delays. After months of silence, the commission promised to begin hearings this spring. The final straw for Fox and Wabano-Iahtail was the recent announcement that hearings wouldn\u2019t start until the fall, aside from a gathering in Whitehorse this week.\nIndigenous communities across Canada need women's shelters now\n\u201cPeople are pissed off, they\u2019re fed up, they\u2019re angry, they\u2019re hurt, they\u2019re disappointed,\u201d says Fox. \u201cThere are families out there that are at suicide risk.\u201d It takes a lot for grieving family members to work up the courage to speak, says Fox. He likens it to tearing off a scab. \u201cYou have to build up yourself to be able to talk about some of these losses, and when you\u2019re ready to talk, and then they close the door on you\u2026 it\u2019s left that scab open.\u201d\nBrenda Wilson coordinates the Highway of Tears Initiative in northwest B.C., which works closely with families of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.\u201cWe\u2019re feeling very insecure, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with it and I don\u2019t blame some of the families for boycotting it,\u201d she says. Wilson\u2019s younger sister, Ramona, was murdered in 1994 in Smithers, B.C.; the family has spent the decades since fighting for an inquiry.\n'A pain most Canadians can't understand': The aftermath of the '60s scoop - Chatelaine\nDespite her longstanding involvement in the inquiry process, Wilson says she only received confirmation that local family meetings were cancelled the week those meetings were scheduled to happen, via a press release. Other families don\u2019t even know the inquiry is underway; there\u2019s been no outreach in many communities. The commission has left it up to families to follow its proceedings online \u2014 a challenge in rural and northern communities without reliable internet \u2014 and to contact an email address or a 1-800 number to register, a fact of which many aren\u2019t aware. \u201cIt\u2019s just been really confusing and information changes from one day to the next,\u201d says Wilson.\nStill, she wants the inquiry to go ahead. \u201cTo boycott it now would be back to the drawing board, back to day one, 40 years ago, 30 years ago, 20 years ago,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cAlthough we want this to happen quickly, we do need to be patient.\u201d\nThe inquiry\u2019s chief commissioner, Marion Buller, says she understands the frustration. \u201cSome families and survivors have worked on making this inquiry happen for 40 years, and they\u2019ve been living with their loss and their grief for a very, very long time.\u201d She\u2019s aware of accusations that the inquiry is re-traumatizing families with delays; the commission is balancing that concern with the need to take time to design hearings that won\u2019t cause further harm, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of, for us, being as careful and thoughtful as we can at every stage of our work.\u201d And communication with families and the public is going to improve, she says, attributing former challenges to a months-long period without a permanent communications director as the hiring process ground through sluggish federal bureaucracy. Buller says she hopes hearings in Whitehorse will allay some of the concerns, with people feeling supported to tell their stories and encourage others to come forward.\nChief commissioner of the MMIW inquiry, Marion Buller, left, and commissioner Michele Audette\nThe Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, which spent decades advocating for missing and murdered indigenous women and girls, began issuing \u201creport cards\u201d assessing the inquiry\u2019s progress in January 2017. Its second report, released May 16, gives the inquiry a \u201cfail\u201d in 10 of its 15 categories. It notes that 300 families had contacted the commission, and only half have received a response. Those who did, according to the report, were put through an assessment to decide \u201cwhether or not the family will be able to speak in front of the Commissioners,\u201d a process the organization says seems \u201ccruel and unusual.\u201d\nNWAC interim president Francyne Joe says her organization has reached out to the commission numerous times after hearing concerns from families about \u201cvetting\u201d to try clarify but didn\u2019t receive a response. But Buller is categorical: \u201cThere\u2019s no vetting, there\u2019s no screening, period,\u201d she says.\n\u201cNobody was expecting this type of adversity coming from the inquiry itself,\u201d says Joe. While NWAC is still committed to working with the inquiry, she applauds the families calling for a boycott. \u201cIt really tells me they\u2019re remaining strong in this adversity as they\u2019ve always done,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re using their voices, I\u2019m proud of them.\u201d\nWhile Joe has been hearing rumblings of a boycott in recent weeks, she says many families are still \u201cat the unsure stage.\u201d If the commission shows they\u2019re listening and responding, those rumblings will die down. \u201cBut if they fail, I am concerned that you\u2019re going to see more families stating \u2026 they\u2019re going to boycott,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that would be the saddest, that would be the tragedy, if this inquiry were to fail.\u201d\nMore:\u00a0\n5 things you need to know about Andrew Scheer, surprise winner of the Conservative leadership\nAlicia Keys on Trump, Trudeau, and really bad karaoke\nSubscribe to our newsletters\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Advertisement\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n          \u2002\u2002\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Pin\n                \n\n\n\n                    Share\n                \n\n\n\n                    Tweet\n                \n\n\n\n                Email            \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop\n \n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n                Facebook            \n\n\n\n                Pin It            \n\n\n\n                Twitter            \n\n\n \n\n\nResources\n \nAbout\nContact\nAdvertise\nSitemap\n\n \n\n\nCreate a new password\n\nWe've sent an email with instructions to create a new password.

Photo by The Canadian Press/Sean Kilpatrick \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious story \n\n\n\n\n\nListen to article\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal Liberal government is committing $8.7 million to hold more consultations on Indigenous resource sharing in a budget that offers relatively little new spending on its reconciliation agenda.On Tuesday, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland tabled a spending plan that prioritizes Canada's transition to a greener economy, offering billions in new tax credits, as well as for health care and affordability.Reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples remains a major priority for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government, with tens of billions announced in previous years, including early in his first mandate. Get daily news from Canada's National Observer Email * Major Indigenous organizations, including the Assembly of First Nations, have told the federal government that billions more are needed to address current and future infrastructure needs, such as housing.The organization, which advocates for the needs of more than 600 First Nations across Canada, said ahead of Tuesday's spending plan that to improve on-reserve housing stock and meet population growth until 2040, about another $60 billion would be required.  \"They certainly talk a good talk about reconciliation,\" National Chief RoseAnne Archibald said Tuesday, adding \"there is a real failing\" when it comes to following through on action. She said First Nations are trapped in what she calls a \"repetitive injustice\" of budget cycles.  What people are reading               Young people are about to get screwed by the budget \u2014 again By Max Fawcett\u00a0|\u00a0Opinion, Politics\u00a0| March 28th 2023      \"We put forward a number of asks for funding for things like infrastructure, education and so on \u2014 and the government turns around and actually deliberately underfunds us.\"Tuesday's budget shows Ottawa plans to inject $4 billion over seven years into an urban, rural and northern Indigenous housing strategy beginning in 2024-25, but that remains under development, and only $1.9 billion of the money is slated to be spent over the next five years.The federal government also committed $8.7 million to Natural Resources Canada in the coming fiscal year to consult Indigenous partners on developing a framework to give communities access to more dollars from resource projects built on their territories.  Budget 2023: Feds commit consultation money for Indigenous resource sharing. #CDNPoli #Budget2023 #Indigenous      That would fulfil a commitment made in last fall's economic statement.Archibald says First Nations need a \"new economic deal\" with Ottawa \u2014 one in which communities would receive more wealth from things like resource-extraction projects, but also one in which they would benefit more broadly from the federal system and its taxation. \"All of the wealth that's built in Canada is actually built on First Nations lands and water,\" she said. Asked about the government's announcement to consult on providing Indigenous communities with more access to resource revenues, Archibald says that without action, the consultation is \"just more spinning of the Liberal government's wheels.\" She added: \"They could actually make investments that would create this new economic deal, a better economic deal for First Nations.\"Archibald said this marks the second federal budget in a row since she became national chief in which Trudeau's government has \"done very little to advance economic reconciliation.\"Trudeau, along with his ministers of Indigenous services and Crown-Indigenous relations, often say more works needs to be done to improve the lives of Indigenous people in the country and the Liberals are committed to doing the work.In recent years, the government has placed a greater focus on self-determination when it comes to supporting Indigenous communities, the tone of which is reflected in Tuesday's budget.It commits to giving Indigenous Services Canada $30 million over the next five years to improve a reserve land and environment management program to ensure \"First Nations can develop capacity to exercise increased responsibility over their lands, resources and environment.\"Another $5 million was also pledged in the coming fiscal year for the department to take part in developing a framework for economic reconciliation in hopes of bolstering economic opportunities for Indigenous people and businesses.The government pledged in February to put $2 billion over the next decade into an \"Indigenous Health Equity Fund.\" In addition to this, it promises to spend around $16 million over three years on efforts to reduce the tuberculosis rates in Inuit communities. Before Tuesday's budget was released, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami- a national organization representing Inuit communities- had requested about $131 million over seven years for this issue.The federal government also promised to spend $2.5 million to advance an action plan on implementing the 2019 recommendations of the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls, fulfilling one of its reconciliation-related promises to the federal New Democrats under its supply and confidence arrangement.This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 28, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch 29th 2023\n\nStephanie Taylor\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep reading \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDanielle Smith calls fed climate policy an existential threat to Alberta\nBy John Woodside & Natasha Bulowski\u00a0|\u00a0News, Politics, Ottawa Insider\u00a0|\nMarch 24th 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPierre Poilievre is \u2018making it fun\u2019 for these young people to be conservative\nBy Natasha Bulowski\u00a0|\u00a0News, Politics, Ottawa Insider\u00a0|\nMarch 23rd 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this articleShare\u00a0on FacebookShare\u00a0on Twitter\n\n\n\nComments \n\n\nSubscribe to join the conversation.

Owen took her own life in a Prescott, Ont., group home and Courtney died in a fire at her group home in Orleans, Ont.\u00a0\u00a0(family photos)\u00a0\u00a0By Tanya TalagaStaff ReporterMon., May 1, 2017Indigenous leaders are demanding an inquiry into the deaths of all Indigenous children in care after the recent deaths of two northern Ontario teenage girls in provincial group homes last month.Poplar Hill First Nation\u2019s Amy Owen, 13, took her own life on April 17 after she was taken out of her community near the Manitoba border and flown to live at a Prescott group home in eastern Ontario.\u201cI don\u2019t know why the parents have to go through this. I always thought they would bury me first. I always prayed for her, hoped she wouldn\u2019t do anything like this,\u201d said her father Jeffrey Owen, 36.\u201cShe would secretly call us. At the agency she was at, they forbade her to talk to us and they always delayed and delayed visits,\u201d he said. Fort Albany First Nation\u2019s Courtney Scott, 16, died in a house fire at her group home on April 21 in Orleans, Ont. She was also living away from home, removed at a young age along with her sisters and brothers.Article Continued Below\u201cTo me, I haven\u2019t seen my granddaughter for so many years, she was so small the last time I saw her. She was maybe 12. She was happy when she saw her mom,\u201d said her grandmother, Madeline Koostachin. The family has many unanswered questions about the fire and what happened to Courtney.Another Poplar Hill girl, Kanina Sue Turtle, 15, was taken into care and she died Oct. 29, 2016. Her family is still waiting for details on if whether Kanina committed suicide, said her father, Clarence Suggashie.\u201cThe kids should be in the community here. They should keep them here so they don\u2019t lose their culture, their language and we can see them,\u201d Suggashie said.Owen, Scott and Turtle are members of one of Nishnawbe Aski Nation\u2019s 49 northern Ontario First Nation communities, and NAN has inherent jurisdiction over their well-being regardless of where they live, said NAN deputy grand chief Anna Betty Achneepineskum.But provincial legislation and how services are delivered do not coincide with NAN\u2019s jurisdiction over their kids, said Achneepineskum. \u201cIt is very obvious the services, the resources and the policies governing those resources need to be fixed. Why should a child have to travel so far away to get basic services?\u201d she asked.\u201cWe want an inquiry.\u201dAchneepineskum added they have no official records that confirm the number of youth the NAN communities have lost while in care, but \u201cthe loss of two young lives in a matter of weeks must be examined.\u201dThe province is trying hard to bring mental health services to kids in remote communities and they are working with their Indigenous partners, including the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, on improving outcomes, said Rob McMahon, a ministry of children and youth spokesperson.\u201cWhere needed, and often as a last resort, there are times when a young person travels outside of their home community to receive care. Children\u2019s aid societies and Indigenous child well-being societies supervise, monitor and track the placement of children in their care, including the children they place in residential resources outside their jurisdictions. However, there is no formal reporting by societies of these numbers at this time,\u201d McMahon said.Mental health services are difficult to access for NAN kids and First Nations-led child agencies struggle with both a severe lack of services and high suicide rates among the youth. It is difficult to access diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation services and delays makes treatment even more elusive.Owen and Scott\u2019s deaths follow the tragic suicides of two girls from Wapakeka First Nation, Jolynn Winter, 12, and her friend, Chantell Fox, 12, who took their lives last January after a plea for emergency mental health funding was refused for the remote community more than 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay. Another four girls were flown out of Wapakeka for urgent mental health care. An anonymous private donor stepped in to pay $380,000 for the emergency care Health Canada had initially refused to provide.Amy had no means of getting any mental health help closer to home so she had to be flown to Ottawa, completely cut off from her Anishinaabe culture, language and from everything she knew, said Achneepineksum. To visit, her parents would have to take a flight to Sioux Lookout, then to Thunder Bay and then to Ottawa, which is expensive.\u201cHow can they expect a child to deal with their mental health issues when they are so disconnected with their families? Phone calls will not do,\u201d she asked.Owen said his daughter Amy tried to commit suicide when she was taken away from her family and placed in a Pickle Lake home. \u201cIt broke her spirit,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish I could have done something to prevent this. I wish I could drive there and just go pick her up. There were just so many things I wish I could have done.\u201dAmy was receiving one-on-one supervision, he said, because she was high risk for suicide. \u201cI don\u2019t know how she could have done this when she was supposed to have all this support. Why was she left in a room for so long? By the time they checked on her it was too late,\u201d he said.\u201cIf they were closer to home, we could visit. Amy wasn\u2019t into hurting herself when she was with us. She was smart, outgoing, she liked to have fun. She loved her family, especially her little sister. She even looks like her,\u201d Owen said. Amy had seven brothers and sisters ranging in age from 18 to 5.When Irwin Elman, Ontario\u2019s Provincial Advocate for Children and Youth, found out about Owen and Scott\u2019s deaths, he insisted there be immediate changes concerning conditions in group homes and how far First Nations kids are taken outside of their communities for care. \u201cFrankly, children should survive our attempts to protect them. That is a pretty low bar in terms of outcome but . . . we need to do something now,\u201d Elman said.Elman has asked the ministry better analyze the 19,000 serious occurrence reports they see every year and they should be used daily to identify homes at risk and visit them immediately to speak to the kids and assess the available supports. \u201cImmediately they should create a roster of clinicians, in my opinion, mental health professionals and trained child and youth workers who can be quickly deployed to homes in crisis to support young people and stabilize the homes,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd then the ministry should determine the numbers and situations of First Nations children living in group homes in southern Ontario. And then they should immediate reach out to those kids through culturally appropriate means to see how they are,\u201d he said.Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines\u00a0NewsletterSubscribeThe Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E\u00a01E6.

The two accused cannot be identified under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.\nAll three were students at the Sagkeeng Anicinabe High School, said principal Claude Guimond.\n\"We're not a very big school. We only have about 220 students here ... and all three of the students in the video, I know them personally and it was hard to take,\" Guimond said.\n\"Tuesday we had a healing ceremony for our students and staff ... and one of the recurring things that came out was how social media \u2014\u00a0Facebook, you know \u2014 made things even worse by people reposting the video.\"\nThe video shows a young woman lying bloodied on the ground and barely conscious as she is repeatedly kicked and punched in the head. It appears to have been taken on a cellphone. Female and male voices can be heard.\nMcKay is the woman being attacked in the video, Guimond said.\nRCMP\u00a0would only say the victim's body was found Sunday night, near a home in Sagkeeng, about two hours after she was reported missing to the detachment in the neighbouring town\u00a0of Powerview.\nCounsellors were brought in this week to help students and staff at the school deal with the death. A vigil was planned for the community\u00a0on Thursday evening.\nSagkeeng, a community of some 3,000 residents, was also the home of\u00a015-year-old Tina Fontaine,\u00a0whose body was pulled from the Red River in Winnipeg in 2014. She\u00a0had left\u00a0Sagkeeng just two months earlier. Her father, Eugene Fontaine, was beaten to death on the reserve three years earlier.\nThe small community has seen several other cases of missing and murdered indigenous women, including\u00a017-year-old Fonessa Bruyere, who was killed\u00a0in Winnipeg in 2007.\nGuimond said gang activity and drug use have encroached on the community from the city.\n\"Over the last 10 years, what I've noticed is that more and more of the gang influence is filtering on to the reserve from Winnipeg,\" Guimond said.\n\"With gang activity comes drug trafficking and stuff like that, and that's what's killing our youth here.\"\nSagkeeng Chief Derrick Henderson said everyone is trying to come to terms with the latest death.\n\"It's been tragic and it's pretty sombre right now.\"\n\u2014 By Steve Lambert in Winnipeg\nThe Canadian Press\n\u00a92017 The Canadian Press\n\nShare Twitter\nFacebook\nGoogle+\nReddit\nForward\n \nTopics:\u00a0\nNational\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen live\nNews\nTalk\nSports\nTraffic\nWeather\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal\nProvincial\nNational\nInternational\nAll Topics\nRSS Feeds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Brent Loucks Show\n6:00am8:30am\n\n\n\n\n\nGormley\n8:30am12:30pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaskatchewan Afternoon\n1:00pm3:00pm\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Green Zone\n3:00pm6:00pm\n\n\n\n\n\nAll Shows\n\n\n\n\nSchedule\nPodcasts On Demand\nContests\nEvents\n\nAdopt A Family\nAuction\nInsider\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Green Zone\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Day with Wray\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Time Sports\n\n\n\n\nRiders\nLocal\nProvincial\nNational\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraffic Updates\nHighway Hotline\nReport a Pothole\n\nLatest Traffic \n\n\nApr 27\n Road Work For Thursday  \n\nApr 26\n Road Work For Wednesday   \n\nApr 25\n Road Work For Tuesday  \n\n\n\n\n\nloading weather...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n  \u00a9 650 CKOM .

Schnarr\nLethbridge Herald\njwschnarr@lethbridgeherald.com\nSept. 1 marked the start of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\nA grassroots group from the Piikani Nation marked the start of the inquiry with a ceremony and by tying more than 1,300 ribbons along a section of Highway 3.\nThe event began with a ceremony to honour missing and murdered indigenous women and girls from the Piikani Nation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming in our little community, we could say five or six are on that list,\u201d said event contact Edna Ann Fairbrother, in regard to the list of more than 1,200 women currently listed as missing or murdered.\n\u201cBut if you look back in history, that list keeps growing.\u201d\nA commission has been established as part of the inquiry to examine and report on the issues behind the violence experienced by FNMI women and girls, and their vulnerability to that violence. It is hoped that examining the underlying factors will identify some of the root causes for that violence.\nFactors could include historical, social, economic, institutional or cultural issues.\nThe commission will also report on policies and practices of government institutions, such as policing, child welfare, coroners, and other government policies, practices, or social and economic conditions.\nIndigenous women and girls in Canada are disproportionately affected by all forms of violence.\nIndigenous women make up four per cent of Canada\u2019s female population but were 16 per cent of all women murdered in Canada between 1980 and 2012.\nFairbrother said those numbers are higher the longer people go back in history.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like (Prime Minister Justin) Trudeau said, it hasn\u2019t been happening for decades. It\u2019s been happening for centuries,\u201d said Fairbrother. \u201cNow finally, it\u2019s being noticed. And we have to pay attention. Moms, grandmothers, aunties, aren\u2019t returning home but for a pine box. And many are missing.\u201d\n\u201cThey are not out of our minds,\u201d she added. \u201cThey are not forgotten. And (the ribbons are) just a little token to get them home safe or get some answers. We\u2019re not done. It\u2019s going to continue.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let this be a silent inquiry,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople have to be made aware that they can participate. And if they ever wanted to make change, now is the time. The inquiry is going to afford that for every person.\u201d\nThe commission will be provided with $53.86 million by the federal government over two years to complete its mandate by the end of 2018.\nFollow @JWSchnarrHerald on Twitter\n\nYou have 7 free stories left to read this month.\nSubscribe Now & get unlimited access\n001000\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n\n Facebook\n Twitter\n YouTube\n\n\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nSubscription Services\nArchive\n \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nThe Lethbridge Herald\nOther Publications\nFood For Thought\n Contact\nCareers\n \n\n\nContact the Lethbridge Herald\n\n504 - 7th Street South\n\t\t\t\t\tLethbridge, AB T1J 3Z7\n[P] (403) 328-4411\n[F] (403)328-4536\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrint Advertising: (403) 328-4410\n\t\t\t\t\tNational Advertising: (403) 380-7585\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Advertising: (403) 380-7585\n\t\t\t\t\tClassifieds: (403) 328-4433\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2016 The Lethbridge Herald, A Division of Continental Newspapers Canada Ltd.\nAdvertising\nTerms and Conditions & Privacy Policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The government should implement them immediately. \n\n\n\n\nThen, do the following.\n\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0Tyee\u00a0is\u00a0supported by\u00a0readers\u00a0like\u00a0you\n\n\n\n\n\n Join us and grow independent\u00a0media in\u00a0Canada\n\n\n\n Immediately stop fighting the orders of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal on the issue of discrimination against Indigenous children in delivery of child welfare services. \nCanada created this tribunal and appointed its members, and it must accept the tribunal orders to pay compensation to children it discriminated against and to ensure that Indigenous children\u2019s health needs are met in a timely fashion without waiting for federal and provincial governments to fight over who will have to pay the bill. \nAfter everything Canada has done to Indigenous children, it\u2019s appalling that it\u2019s now in court arguing against the ruling.\nImmediately implement Truth and Reconciliation Commission Call to Action 93, to revise, in collaboration with national Indigenous organizations, the information kit for newcomers to Canada and the citizenship test in order to reflect a more inclusive history of First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit peoples, including information about treaties and the history of residential schools.\nIn addition, when Canadian citizens apply to obtain or renew their passports, they should be provided with a booklet and online information that focuses on the diversity of Indigenous peoples, their inherent right to self-government and land ownership based on the principle of prior occupation, the general terms of the treaties that were signed with colonial powers, treaty promises not yet fully implemented, residential schools and intergenerational impact, and the principles of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples compared to the Indian Act.\nNext, Canada should enact new legislation \u2014 specifically, the \u201cEvery Child Matters Act.\u201d This new law would: \n1. Enact provisions that are consistent with the July 1, 2021, statement of the Canadian Historical Association and modelled after the Ukrainian Famine and Genocide (\u201cHolodomor\u201d) Memorial Day Act, creating a new law acknowledging and commemorating the genocide carried out against Indigenous peoples in Canada. Canada acknowledges eight genocides around the world but not its own genocide. \nIn addition to the non-binding motion this February against China\u2019s treatment of its Uyghur population, Canada recognizes the following genocides: the Holocaust during the Second World War; the Armenian genocide; the Holodomor; the Rwandan genocide; the Srebrenica massacres; the mass killing of the Yazidi people; and the mass murder of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar. \nYet Canada is silent about the genocide it carried out against Indigenous peoples here.\n2. Amend the Criminal Code provision on genocide, Section 318(2), which was deliberately chosen to be narrower than the United Nations convention on genocide. Canada included, in its provision, \u201cdeliberately killing members of the group\u201d and \u201cdeliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction.\u201d In other words, any attempts to destroy a group that stop short of deliberate mass murder are fine by Canada. Canada\u2019s definition excluded these parts of the UN definition: \u201c(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\u201d\nIt is not enough for Canada to simply add in the provisions from the UN convention. We went narrower in the past; now it is time to go broader. This time, Canada should add the full UN convention and expressly include cultural genocide, just as Raphael Lemkin, the original driving force behind the convention and one of the drafters of the convention, wanted. The UN convention did not ask Indigenous peoples what they thought the definition of genocide should be, and colonial powers, including Canada, said they would not support the convention at all if it included a reference to cultural genocide. Shame on Canada.\n3. Enact an inquiry under the Inquiries Act with power of subpoena and funding to go into all relevant archives and make digital copies of all relevant records relating to Indian residential schools, starting with Justice Canada, the RCMP and the Catholic Church. These would include records of the children who attended the schools, including any records of birth, baptism, communion and marriage while the child was a student at an Indian residential school. All Justice Canada files for every criminal prosecution and civil court case should be expressly included. \n\n\n\n\nAll statements of claim, all statements of defence, all motions and factums, all affidavits, examinations for discovery, transcripts, correspondence, court orders and Justice Canada legal advice should be included. \nAll Government of Canada memos relating to whether or not to enter into a settlement agreement and whether or not to issue an apology and memos concerning the negotiating positions for drafting those documents should be included. \nAll police files, witness interviews, correspondence and records transmitted between police forces to the RCMP, all communications between the RCMP and prosecutors, and all charges filed, should be included. \nAll school narratives and journals created by church personnel documenting the happenings within the parish where an Indian residential school operated should be included. \nAll records subject to Canada\u2019s responses to all residential school issues should be within the mandate of the inquiry in order to undo the damage done by Justice Goudge in Fontaine v. Canada. Goudge ruled that how Canada responded to Indian residential schools is not \u201crelevant\u201d to the historical record about Canada\u2019s treatment of Indian residential school children and not relevant to the mandate of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada. He could not have been more wrong. Canada\u2019s response is the coverup. \n\n\n\n                           A woman pauses in front of a memorial at the Vancouver Art Gallery.

Enact that all records from the Independent Assessment Process to determine survivors eligibility for compensation are to be preserved according to national archives and privacy laws unless the IAP claimant has expressly consented to the destruction of some or all of their records. Enact that the records be sealed for 20 years. \nThe current ruling of the Supreme Court is that all IAP records will be destroyed in 2027 unless a survivor has specifically requested to have their record preserved. In other words, the IAP refused to offer survivors any consent option at all until it was finally forced to by the courts, and even that \u201cconsent\u201d option provides that any survivor who does not receive, understand or respond to the IAP\u2019s consent offer will have their records destroyed without their consent. \nHow many survivors have died before having the chance to express a choice, how many are so sick and frail they can no longer meaningfully engage with the process, how many no longer have lawyers or cultural supports to explain the process and the choices to them, how many are so fed up with the entire process and with being forced to relive the memories of their abuse that they no longer want to have anything to do with the process?\nHow many thousands or tens of thousands of IAP claimants will simply not respond? The destruction without consent of evidence of residential school abuses must stop now by enacting a consent process for the destruction of records to be conducted by the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation. \nThe Independent Assessment Process violated the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement in the following ways: The IAP refused to give survivors the choice to have their records preserved, refused to give survivors the choice to donate their records to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission or the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, refused to reasonably co-ordinate with the TRC, refused to allow the TRC to build off the information collected and created by the IAP, and refused to create an archive for the purpose of preserving IAP records. The IAP refused to allow the TRC and NCTR to explain how survivors\u2019 privacy and wishes would be respected and protected and to explain the value of preserving the records. The IAP refused to distinguish between different categories of IAP records for preservation or destruction. The IAP should never have been allowed to operate a consent program after having violated the settlement agreement in these many ways.\n5. Enact that the Catholic Church is a legal entity and make all of its assets available to satisfy damage awards against the church, and not only the assets of a specific diocese. The Catholic Church has refused to incorporate itself as the hierarchical, national and international organization that it is. The Catholic Church routinely goes to court to argue that the church is not a legal entity and is not liable for paying damages it has caused, and that only the assets of an individual diocese are available to satisfy damage awards. This has to stop. \nFurther, enact that any municipality can impose property taxes on any religious properties as the municipality chooses (in a non-discriminatory way).  \n6. Amend the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act to state that any organization funded by the Government of Canada, as well as the Government of Canada itself, is vicariously liable for any child abuse committed by employees or volunteers of the organization that occurred within the general context of the services that were funded. Too many survivors of child abuse have had justice delayed and justice denied while the Government of Canada and the churches fought in court for years about vicarious liability, and the courts have never provided satisfactory clarity, which creates continuing needless litigation. The government can and must put an end to these litigation loopholes that only harm abused children. \n7. Enact that the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement is not discharged until all aspects of it have been fulfilled, including Catholic payments and disclosure by Canada and the churches of all relevant records. Enact that two parties to the settlement agreement do not have the power to amend the settlement agreement to waive financial obligations or document disclosure obligations under the settlement agreement without the consent of all parties. Further, no part of the settlement agreement should be discharged based on a misrepresentation by Canada or the churches. \n\n\n\n                           Students at the Shingwauk Residential School in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\nPhoto from Shingwauk Residential Schools Centre.\n\n\n8. Amend the Criminal Code to implement Truth and Reconciliation Commission Call to Action 6 and repeal Section 43 of the Criminal Code, which makes it legal for school teachers, parents and guardians to assault children. Most of the section as written has already been struck down but the section remains unchanged and does not remotely correspond with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. \nThe Supreme Court says that teachers cannot hit children, except by using reasonable force to restrain or guide a student (for example, out of a classroom). Further, anyone who is not a legal guardian of a child cannot hit the child. Further, even a parent or legal guardian is prohibited from hitting a child who is less than 24 months old or more than 12 years old. A parent or guardian can only use corrective force that is \u201ctransitory and trifling.\u201d They cannot use force that might cause bodily harm, cannot hit a child because the parent or guardian has lost their temper, cannot use any object to hit a child, cannot hit a child on the head, cannot hit a child in a degrading, inhumane or harmful way and cannot hit a child who has disabilities and cannot \u201clearn\u201d from any hitting. \nYet the original Section 43 is still on the books and has not been changed to incorporate any of the Supreme Court\u2019s guidelines. That makes Section 43 a \u201czombie\u201d law that needs to be amended to precisely reflect the Supreme Court decision \u2014 or better yet, simply repealed. Evidence of the harm that hitting children causes and the number of countries that have repealed equivalent laws has been growing by leaps and bounds since the Supreme Court decision. There are now 63 countries that have eliminated legal excuses for hitting children. Canada is not one of them, despite our history of Indian residential schools and discrimination against Indigenous children through the '60s Scoop and underfunding Indigenous child welfare. \n9. Amend the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in order to implement Truth and Reconciliation Commission Call to Action 26: \n\u201cWe call upon the federal, provincial and territorial governments to review and amend their respective statutes of limitations to ensure that they can conform to the principle that governments and other entities cannot rely on limitation defences to defend legal actions of historical abuse brought by Aboriginal people.\u201d\n(See \u201cThe Horrors of Canada\u2019s Tort Law System: the Indian Residential Schools Civil Cases,\u201d Section 7 (\u201cLimitations\u201d), and Kent McNeil, \u201cAbuse of Indigenous Peoples Goes Beyond Residential Schools.\u201d)\n10. Enact an obligation on the Government of Canada to table an annual report listing every law society and every law school in Canada and explaining what each one has done to implement Truth and Reconciliation Commission Calls to Action 27 and 28, which demand that all law societies require all lawyers to take a professional development course, and all law schools require all law students to take a course on Indigenous diversity, history, rights under UNDRIP, the content of the various treaties and the yet-to-be-implemented treaty promises, and the specific requirements of the \u201chonour of Crown,\u201d fiduciary duty, duty to consult and Aboriginal title. \n11. Amend the Statistics Canada Act to implement Truth and Reconciliation Commission Call to Action 39: \n\u201cWe call upon the federal government to develop a national plan to collect and publish data on the criminal victimization of Aboriginal people, including data related to homicide and family violence victimization.\u201d\n(CBC\u2019s Beyond 94 reporting asserted that this Call to Action had been completed. While Statistics Canada has made important changes to its homicide report, family violence reporting has yet to be addressed.)\n12. Enact a process that will create Indigenous justice systems in order to implement Truth and Reconciliation Commission Call to Action 42: \n\u201cWe call upon the federal, provincial and territorial governments to commit to the recognition and implementation of Aboriginal justice systems in a manner consistent with the Treaty and Aboriginal Rights of Aboriginal peoples, the Constitutional Act, 1982 and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, endorsed by Canada in November 2012.\u201d\nThe Report of the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba described Indigenous justice systems in the United States and proposed guidelines for creating them in Canada. \nI would add that Indigenous justice systems in Canada should be developed and approved by Indigenous women. No Indigenous victims of violence should be forced into a process where they don\u2019t feel safe or respected.\n13. Amend Section 23 of the Access to Information Act and Section 27 of the Privacy Act to implement Truth and Reconciliation Commission Call to Action 51: \n\u201cWe call upon the Government of Canada, as an obligation of its fiduciary responsibility, to develop a policy of transparency by publishing legal opinions it develops and upon which it acts or intends to act, in regard to the scope and extent of Aboriginal and Treaty rights.\u201d\nAt a bare minimum, amend the Access to Information Act to permit non-disclosure of federal legal advice on Indigenous issues only for a period of 20 years.\n14. Amend the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act to implement Truth and Reconciliation Commission Call to Action 52: \n\u201cWe call upon the Government of Canada, provincial and territorial governments, and the courts, to adopt the following legal principles:\ni) Aboriginal title claims are accepted once the Aboriginal claimant has established occupation over a particular territory at a particular point in time.\nii) Once Aboriginal title has been established, the burden of proving any limitation on any rights arising from the existence of that title shifts to the party asserting such a limitation.\u201d\n15. Enact provisions to implement Truth and Reconciliation Commission Call to Action 64 for any education institutions receiving federal funds:\n\u201cWe call upon all levels of government that provide public funds to denominational schools to require such schools to provide an education on comparative religious studies, which must include a segment on Aboriginal spiritual beliefs and practices developed in collaboration with Aboriginal Elders.\u201d\n16. Amend the Library and Archives of Canada Act to implement Truth and Reconciliation Commission Call to Action 69:\n\u201cWe call upon Library and Archives Canada to:\ni) Fully adopt and implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the United Nations Joinet-Orentlicher Principles, as related to Aboriginal peoples\u2019 inalienable right to know the truth about what happened and why, with regard to human rights violations committed against them in residential schools.\nii) Ensure that its record holdings related to residential schools are accessible to the public.\niii) Commit more resources to its public education materials and programming on residential schools.\u201d\n17. Amend the Historic Sites and Monuments Act to implement Truth and Reconciliation Commission Call to Action 79:\n\u201cWe call upon the federal government, in collaboration with Survivors, Aboriginal organizations and the arts community, to develop a reconciliation framework for Canadian heritage and commemoration. This would include, but not be limited to:\ni) Amending the Historic Sites and Monuments Act to include First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis representation on the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada and its Secretariat.\nii) Revising the policies, criteria and practices of the National Program of Historical Commemoration to integrate Indigenous history, heritage values and memory practices into Canada\u2019s national heritage and history.\niii) Developing and maintaining a national heritage plan and strategy for commemorating residential school sites, the history and legacy of residential schools and the contributions of Aboriginal Peoples to Canada\u2019s history.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo TRC Calls to Action Are a Litmus Test for Governments. They\u2019re Failing\n\tread more \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18. Amend the Department of Justice Act to require all Department of Justice legal advice and litigation positions to be consistent with UNDRIP, the honour of the Crown, the fiduciary duty and the duty to consult (including definitions of the latter three terms). \nFurther amend the Department of Justice Act to require the department to table before Parliament a statement on whether each new bill or regulation has a significant risk of infringing Indigenous rights, including whether any Indigenous group has made such an assertion. This would be modelled on Section 4.2 of the act on charter statements.\nAfter more than 150 years of extreme discrimination against Indigenous peoples, it is time to demand bolder steps than it seems like Justice Canada will ever support.\nCanada needs the Every Child Matters Act. We need to implement the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Calls to Action in law.  \n Read more: Indigenous, Rights + Justice  \n\n\n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Share on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Share on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Forward by Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nShare article via email\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend this article to:\n\n\n\nYour email address:\n\n\n\nYour message:\n\n\n\nWould you like to receive The Tyee's headlines free by email?\n\n\n\n                                    Yes, every day.\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Yes, once a week.\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Yes, once a week, national news only.\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    I already subscribe.\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    No, thanks.\n                                \n\n\n\nSubmit\n\nShow form again \u00bb\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0Tyee\u00a0is\u00a0supported by\u00a0readers\u00a0like\u00a0you\n\n\n\n\n\n Join us and grow independent\u00a0media in\u00a0Canada\n\n\n\n\n\nFacts matter.

Recently, the 32-year-old completed a cross-Canada walk to raise awareness of missing and murdered Indigenous women and to break down systemic barriers between Indigenous people and non-Indigenous people. - Nicholas Mercer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Matthew Jefferson reached Cape Spear on the eastern tip of this province June 25, it marked the end of one journey, but only the beginning of something bigger.\u00a0\nHe had left Victoria, B.C. more than a year earlier on a campaign to raise awareness of missing and murdered Indigenous women and to break down barriers between Indigenous people and non-Indigenous people.\u00a0\nIn that time, the 32-year-old Jefferson travelled 8,275\u00a0kilometres, moved through 64 Indigenous communities and interacted with thousands of people along the way. He is on his third backpack and his sixth pair of sneakers.\u00a0\nStill, when he reached Cape Spear there was no feeling of triumph or accomplishment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019d think that I\u2019d be ecstatic and overjoyed that I had finished this walk,\u201d Jefferson told a small group of people at The Mary March Museum in Grand Falls-Windsor Sunday afternoon. \u201cYes, I\u2019m done the walk but I\u2019m not done the work.\u201d\u00a0\nWhile Jefferson spoke, his backpack sat on a table near the far wall of the room. Attached to the front of it was a photo of his aunt, Frances Brown. She and Jefferson\u2019s mother are\u00a0Witset\u00a0First Nation in central British Columbia.\u00a0\nBrown went missing Oct. 14, 2017 while picking mushrooms north of Smithers, B.C and she still hasn\u2019t been found.\u00a0\nShe loved eagles and whenever Jefferson sees one flying overhead he wonders aloud if it is his auntie and he sends a prayer to her.\u00a0\nThe picture makes it feel like Brown is with Jefferson every step of his journey, but there was a portion of his walk for which Brown\u2019s picture was not attached to his backpack.\u00a0\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t until he reached Port Hope, B.C. that he made the picture a part of his pack. Up until that point, Jefferson didn\u2019t feel he was worthy to carry her photo.\u00a0\nThrough his journey, Jefferson has learned there are people in this country that want to help but don\u2019t know how.\u00a0\nBaby steps are what he spoke of. Learn the history of the land we\u2019re on and its traditional name.\u00a0\nLearn the history and the culture of the people who occupied that land.\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to learn their language, you just have to learn to respect it,\u201d said Jefferson. \u201cThen, with that new understanding, reach out to them in a respectful, humble way.\u201d\u00a0\nEarlier this year, the results of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls was released.\u00a0\nIt outlined 231 changes that need to be made by governments and the people of Canada to put an end to violence against Indigenous women and girls.\u00a0\nIt isn\u2019t just his aunt Frances who has connected Jefferson personally to the plight of missing Indigenous people in this country. His 16-year-old cousin, Colton Fleury, disappeared from Prince George over a year ago and hasn\u2019t been seen since.\u00a0\nAlthough Jefferson is in the midst of writing a book about his journey, he has plans to cross Canada two more times.\u00a0\u00a0\nOnce on a bike next year, which he will film for a documentary, and the other the following year when he and others will run a marathon each day across Canada.\u00a0\nAnother cousin, 18-year-old Jessica Patrick, disappeared in late August 2017. On Sept. 15, her body was found at the bottom of Hudson Bay Mountain. Jefferson said he had been raped and murdered. Patrick left behind a young son.\u00a0\nJefferson walks for them.\u00a0\nIn Newfoundland and Labrador, the stories of Loretta Saunders, an Indigenous woman from Happy Valley-Goose Bay murdered in Halifax, N.S., and\u00a0Conne\u00a0River\u2019s Chantel John \u2014 allegedly murdered by her boyfriend Kirk Keeping \u2014 have brought this serious issue closer to home.\u00a0\nJefferson walks for them too.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is my lifelong journey,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m helping to give a voice to those who don\u2019t have one.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore

I feel scared for urban Indigenous young people who are affected by too many systems that fail them,\u201d said Michael Redhead Champagne, 30, an organizer with Aboriginal Youth Opportunities in Winnipeg.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am nervous for all of my relatives who are wrapped up in a justice system that doesn\u2019t know what that word means.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLast month, a jury found Raymond Cormier not guilty in the 2014 death of 15-year-old Tina Fontaine. Her body was found wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down with rocks in Winnipeg\u2019s Red River.\n\u00a0\nLess than two weeks earlier, a Saskatchewan jury found Gerald Stanley not guilty in the 2016 killing of 22-year-old Colten Boushie, who was shot after the vehicle he was in drove onto Stanley\u2019s farm.\n\u00a0\nBoth verdicts brought people into the streets to protest.\n\u00a0\nThe Ontario First Nations Young Peoples Council said the verdicts highlight the \u201csystemic racism that is pervading the Canadian justice system.\u201d The Canadian Roots Exchange, a group of Indigenous and non-Indigenous youth dedicated to reconciliation, posted a statement saying \u201cracism, colonialism and white supremacy continue to thrive.\u201d\n\u00a0\nChampagne said it\u2019s hard to have faith in a justice system that ignores countless reports and recommendations, including the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry from 1991, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples from 1996 and calls to action by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s time for action, he said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI want the justice system in Canada in general to quit asking Indigenous people what we need, because we have already told you,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cRight now, we can\u2019t have a conversation about reconciliation in this country until we feel that there is justice.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBrendin Beaulieu, an 18-year-old Winnipeg high school student, is preparing for graduation. The six-foot-five teenager who likes to make music in his spare time said he has to deal with a \u201cbroken heart\u201d as he grapples with \u201cknowing there are things we can do but it\u2019s going to take time.\u201d\n\u00a0\nVitriol online shows there\u2019s a lot of talking about Indigenous youth but not nearly enough listening to them, Beaulieu said.\n\u00a0\nJada Ross, 17, goes to a different high school across the city, but is having similar conversations with her friends and family. She said they are scared and saddened but determined to make change.\n\u00a0\nLauren Chopek, 21, knows all too well how vulnerable Tina was on the city\u2019s streets.\n\u00a0\nChopek was sexually exploited as a teenager. Now, she runs the Midnight Medicine Walk to help others in the same position. She said it feels as if Indigenous people have been asking for justice for a long time, but it\u2019s essential Canada hears it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve been there in her shoes, and also misjudged and just ignored as a person on the street, being a child that needs to be somewhere safe. I needed help and I just got judged,\u201d she said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are we always the ones standing up for ourselves? How come there is no one else vouching for us?\u201d\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story? We'd like to hear from you about this or any other stories you think we should know about.

(The federal government) probably pressured the RCMP to back them up \u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true, someone should challenge them to release that data.\u201d\nThe RCMP released a report showing that between 1980 and 2012, 1,181 aboriginal women were murdered or went missing, and they describe a list of contributing factors, however it does not show the 70 per cent statistic.\nFor Dyck, the lack of transparency coming from the RCMP Commissioner Bob Poulson and Valcourt is more reason to call for a national inquiry, to get down to the truth about why aboriginal women and girls are so vulnerable. Dyck believes the vulnerability stems from attitudes born in the residential school system and they continue to linger.\n\u201cTwo of the biggest factors are racism and sexism which we don\u2019t really talk about \u2013 you mix sexism and racism together then you have a potent cocktail that makes aboriginal women and girls vulnerable so mostly men feel they can pick on them, assault them and make sexual advances because you talk to young women and they\u2019re fearful when they walk down the streets they have to be careful because our society has allowed this image of aboriginal women,\u201d Dyck said, adding residential schools taught generations that aboriginals were an inferior race.\nThe horrors of the residential schools system were laid out in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), and one of the many recommendations from the TRC report asks for a national inquiry. But rather than making aboriginal issues and election issue, Dyck said First Nations may have a bigger impact on provincial governments.\n\u201cMissing and murdered indigenous women should be an election issue but not many aboriginal issues are election issues because we don\u2019t represent a very large number, but here in Saskatchewan and Manitoba we do so maybe provincially there\u2019s more we can do on that level,\u201d Dyck said.\nA lot of things can change after Canadians head to the polls on Oct. 19, and if there is a change in government, Dyck hopes they work to gather evidence and figure out why so many aboriginal women are murdered or go missing.\n\u201cRight now we don\u2019t really understand all the factors and one of the things the TRC really makes clear is that we need to educate all Canadians because we\u2019ve all been taught the mistruth about aboriginal people in Canada; and if we get to that I think then a change will start to happen,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n Email fbiber@ckom.com \n Twitter @Notthebeebs  \n\n\nShare Twitter\nFacebook\nGoogle+\nReddit\nForward\n \nTopics:\u00a0\nLocal, Saskatchewan, First Nations/Aboriginal, TRC, RCMP\n\n\nJoin the Discussion\nNews Talk 650 CKOM is happy to provide a forum for commenting and discussion.

The hearings are being held at Membertou First Nation in Cape Breton.\n\u201cThe purpose of the \u2026 ceremonies is to honour the women and the ancestors that are coming here for this truth,\u201d said Maloney. \u201cA lot of people are feeling the presence of the missing and murdered women.\u201d\nThe president of the Nova Scotia Native Women\u2019s Association is among 40 witnesses who are expected to testify at the hearings, which kick off on Monday.\nMany of those gathering to testify participated in a community feast on Sunday evening that included drumming, dancing and singing.\nCatherine Martin, a Mi\u2019kmaq filmmaker and storyteller, said during the ceremonies she\u2019s been inspired by the efforts by aboriginal women to bring the stories of missing and murdered aboriginal women and girls to light.\n\u201cThe strength of these women has inspiring to me. \u2026 It\u2019s a commitment to bring these women back to where they should be, a place of honour, a sacred place.\u201d\nMaloney said she and other community members are working to \u201cback up\u201d Indigenous women and families as they prepare to share their traumatic stories with the inquiry, which has been criticized for lacking such emotional supports.\nThe inquiry has been dogged by controversy, including delays and a high-profile resignation, prompting some groups to call for a restart.\nMaloney echoed concerns that have been raised in recent months, but said the inquiry should nevertheless push ahead.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be very critical \u2026 We have to do what we can to make things work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the families. This is the stories of the life and death of missing and murdered Indigenous women that we\u2019re talking about.\u201d\nMaloney said she has lost sleep in anticipation of her testimony before the commissioners on Tuesday, where she will speak on behalf of the family of Victoria Rose Paul of Indian Brook, N.S.\nThe 44-year-old woman died in 2009 after suffering a stroke while in jail for public intoxication.\nA review of the Truro, N.S., police\u2019s handling of the incident found that officers did not properly monitor Paul\u2019s health while she was in custody. It also said she was incoherent and left lying on the cement floor of the lockup for four hours in her own urine.\nThe commission is also expected to hear from the family of murdered Innu student Loretta Saunders.\nThe 26-year-old\u2019s body was found on the side of a New Brunswick highway in February 2014.\nMiriam Saunders said outside the conference area that she hoped to spread the message about the need for improved social services for indigenous women.\n\u201cThe reason I chose Nova Scotia is that my daughter was murdered here and here is where I feel all my supports are,\u201d she said in an interview the night before the hearings began.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to talk about the way my people are being treated. There are many ways they\u2019re being mistreated through different organizations including social services, child welfare. I can see why they\u2019re getting murdered because there\u2019s no supports in our community to help them be stronger people,\u201d she said.\nThe inquiry has visited three communities across Canada prior to this week\u2019s hearings: Whitehorse, Smithers B.C., and Winnipeg.\nAn interim report is set to be released on Nov. 1.\n \u2013  Story by Adina Bresge in Halifax, with files from Michael Tutton.\n000000000000\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n\n Facebook\n Twitter\n YouTube\n\n\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nSubscription Services\nArchive\n \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nThe Lethbridge Herald\nOther Publications\nFood For Thought\n Contact\nCareers\n \n\n\nContact the Lethbridge Herald\n\n504 - 7th Street South\n\t\t\t\t\tLethbridge, AB T1J 3Z7\n[P] (403) 328-4411\n[F] (403)328-4536\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrint Advertising: (403) 328-4410\n\t\t\t\t\tNational Advertising: (403) 380-7585\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Advertising: (403) 380-7585\n\t\t\t\t\tClassifieds: (403) 328-4433\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2017 The Lethbridge Herald, A Division of Continental Newspapers Canada Ltd.\nAdvertising\nTerms and Conditions & Privacy Policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The force added another 32 deaths and 11 disappearances in a 2015 update.\nBennett, who has been travelling the country to talk to grieving loved ones, hopes the government will be able to develop the inquiry's mandate by summer.\nA key step in this process will involve naming a commissioner or commissioners to lead the examination, which is intended to be arm's length from government once it is up and running.\nThe inquiry leadership will have to consider a number of questions, including whether cold cases need to be revisited, Bennett noted.\n\"That will be the job of the commissioners \u2014 to sort out what they feel they can do about these,\" she said.\nThe process also needs to consider the survivors, she added.\n\"When we talk about families, we haven't been focused on the people who know it could have been them, it was almost them, people who ran away from the (Robert) Pickton farm, people who woke up after being strangled,\" she said.\nThe families have also indicated they still want to be involved once the inquiry has started, Bennett added.\nStatus of Women Minister Patty Hajdu said she is no stranger to tragic stories, having worked in Thunder Bay, Ont., where she ran a shelter for men, women and youth.\n\n\n\n\n\"Daily, I heard stories like this and witnessed personally, violence,\" she said.\nShe said the pre-inquiry process was also emotional.\n\"I think that if you are truly doing this job well, you need to be able to bear witness to that pain and you need to be able to empathize without losing yourself in the grief.\n\"It is a very delicate balance actually ... It is our shared responsibility to hear these stories as Canadians.\"\nOne of the most challenging aspects of the pre-inquiry phases has been hearing how hopeful people are about the process, Bennett added.\n\"In some ways, the hardest part is the hope that a lot of these participants are expressing, that they're actually talking to people who can make a difference in their lives and the responsibility that we feel,\" she said.\n\"That we have to put the concrete actions in place that will stop this tragedy.\"\nClaudette Commanda from Ontario's Kitigan Zibi First Nations reserve attended Monday's discussions.\nCanada must be accountable for racism against aboriginal people, she said.\n\"That's the common theme that is coming out of this,\" Commanda said.\n\"The families want justice and the families want healing. But importantly, the families want their voices to be heard for their loved ones because their loved ones are not here to speak.\"\nKristy Kirkup, The Canadian Press\n\n\n\n\nShare this article.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterFacebook Like\n\n\n\nFebruary 15th 2016The Canadian Press\n\n\n\nPolitics, MMIW, Inquiry on missing and murdered Indigenous women, Liberal Party of Canada, Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women, News\n\n\n\n\nToday's must read \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the National Observer.

Countless others who followed a similar trajectory are no longer alive to tell the tale.\nTo this day, that same cycle is repeating itself with alarming frequency in Indigenous communities across Canada, a CP investigation has found.\nAnd with its insidious links to suicide, violence and mental health problems, the issue of child sexual abuse is poised to be a key theme in next year\u2019s long-anticipated national inquiry into the tragic phenomenon of murdered and missing Indigenous women.\nAcoose was just three years old and living in Regina when it started _ three separate uncles, all of them now dead. The memory later manifested as emotional, spiritual and physical self-punishment, fuelled by the cocktail of drugs and alcohol she used to numb her pain.\n\u201cThat was just my destiny,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I became what I became, because I grew up bitter, against men.\u201d\nIndeed, experiences of sexual and physical abuse among Indigenous women and girls are so pervasive they are expected to overwhelm next year\u2019s national inquiry, where commissioners will examine and report on the systemic causes of the violence.\nHearings are expected to begin in early 2017 and will undoubtedly draw attention from around the globe, said chief commissioner Marion Buller.\nIn May 2014, the RCMP documented 1,181 murdered and missing women between 1980 and 2012. A year later, it said 32 additional Aboriginal women had been murdered and 11 more had disappeared since it first reported on the issue.\nThe force also cited an \u201cunmistakable connection\u201d between homicide and family violence.\nAboriginal women are vulnerable precisely because they\u2019re Aboriginal and women, said Dr. Yvonne Boyer, a Canada Research Chair at Manitoba\u2019s Brandon University.\nBoyer co-authored a report on trafficking of Aboriginal women for the Public Safety Department in May 2014 that noted many of its participants suffered sexual abuse as a child, contributing to a pattern of exploitation that carried on into their adult years.\n\u201cI see it as all being on a continuum,\u201d she said in an interview.\n\u201cYou have children who are abused, you have young teenagers that are abused, they go through life, then it is just normalized behaviour \u2026 some of them, we just don\u2019t hear their voices anymore because they\u2019re gone.\u201d\nThe links between missing and murdered women and childhood sexual abuse are undeniable, added Wally Oppal, who led B.C.\u2019s hearings on how authorities handled cases in the wake of the Robert Pickton investigation.\nPickton _ one of Canada\u2019s most notorious serial killers _ was convicted in 2007 of the murders of six women and charged in the deaths of 20 others. A number of them were Aboriginal.\nOppal\u2019s report found Aboriginal women experience higher levels of violence in terms of both incidence and severity and are disproportionately represented among the missing and murdered.\n\u201cI still think of those women and what had happened to them \u2026 the abuses that had taken place and why they had left home,\u201d he said.\nIndigenous women who have been incarcerated like Acoose commonly suffer from abuse and share similar vulnerable backgrounds with those who go murdered and missing, said Kim Pate _ longtime head of the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies and one of Canada\u2019s newest senators.\nThese women are at risk of being re-victimized. They find themselves over-policed yet underprotected from the violence and exploitation that enters all too often into their lives, she said.\n\u201cIf they end up on the street or in communities where they are being victimized, they\u2019re often trying to figure out ways to survive that violence,\u201d Pate said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to negotiate their lives.\u201d\nIndigenous women are also more likely to be criminalized for fighting back, Pate added.\nWhile The Canadian Press has a policy of not identifying the victims of sexual assault, Acoose agreed to be identified in this story as part of her ongoing efforts to raise awareness about the issue.\nIn her work at the First Nations University of Canada\u2019s Saskatoon campus, she finds herself pondering a lingering question: why wasn\u2019t there a national public inquiry 20 years ago?\n\u201cI am so fortunate to be able to talk to people and tell my story,\u201d Acoose said. \u201cI should have been dead by the time I was 20.\u201d\nnews@aptn.ca\n\nFollow @aptnnews\n\n\n\n\nTags: Featured, mmiw, MMIWG, National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women\n\n\n\nAPTN National News\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tView all posts by APTN National News \u2192 \n\n\n\n\n12 people hospitalized, another 200 injured as North Dakota police use water cannons, rubber bullets on #NoDAPL supporters\nStanding Rock, Chief Dan George and the political panel on Nation to Nation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch for:\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Posts\n\n\nPolice say Standing Rock winterized protest camps against the law \n12 people hospitalized, another 200 injured as North Dakota police use water cannons, rubber bullets on #NoDAPL supporters \nMi\u2019kmaq are \u2018conquered people\u2019 says Nova Scotia government lawyer \nIqaluit Tim Hortons turning away gift cards from homeless clients \nMother and two children ordered to leave on-reserve home \nStanding Rock Tribal Council votes to oust Red Warrior camp over agressive tactics \nPolice in North Dakota pummel DAPL opponents with tear gas, water cannons in sub-zero temperatures \nJoanne Neepin laid to rest as family pleas for information on her death \nDid North Dakota police use water as a weapon against #NoDAPL supporters?

After that, Inuit voices started trickling in.\nNTI joins the Qulliit Nunavut Status of Women, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, Northern Quebec MP Romeo Saganash, the United Nations\u2019 Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and many others who have demanded an inquest from the federal government.\nThe Government of Nunavut howeverhas not offered support for such a national examination into the heightened violence Aboriginal women face in this country.\nAt the end of February this year, in the absence of an inquiry, Aboriginal groups met with provincial and territorial leaders at a national roundtable to end violence against Indigenous women and girls in Canada.\nIn 2014, an RCMP report reported that 1,017 Aboriginal women had been murdered and another 164 had gone missing between 1980 and 2012. \nThe RCMP identified 20 female victims of homicide in Nunavut between 1980 and 2012. \n\u201cNTI recognizes there is violence in Nunavut communities,\u201d Eetoolook said. \n\u201cWe need support and resources to end the victimization of women and children,\u201d he added. \n\u201cResponding to this unacceptable reality should be a priority for the Government of Nunavut and the Government of Canada.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(12) Comments:\n#1.\u00a0Posted by  george on June 10, 2015\n\nWhen is NTI going to do SOMETHING for its own people????\n\u201cGovernment needs to do this, government needs to do that\u2026.etc.\u201d\nNTI is so irrelevant.

As NTI image is well known being very vocal against a rainbow flag, a flag representing gay, lesbian, bi and transgender people in Nunavut, plus NTI\u2019s pro seismic testing and uranium mining.

In recent weeks, the commission has also seen resignations from executive director Michele Moreau, director of operations Chantale Courcy and others.\nSheila North Wilson, a grand chief who represents First Nations in northern Manitoba, has called on chief commissioner Marion Buller to step down.\nRelatives of the missing and murdered have lost faith that the inquiry will properly fulfil its mandate and offer hope that the number of victims will be lower in the future, the coalition said.\nDelaronde says families don\u2019t want the inquiry scrapped, but want several changes including a slate of new commissioners who are related to victims or who have worked closely with victims\u2019 families and an Indigenous-led process that is less like a courtroom hearing.\nBetty Rourke, whose sister and daughter were killed in separate incidents decades apart, said she watched footage of the inquiry\u2019s hearing in Whitehorse and was shocked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like you\u2019re on trial there,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to have to be sworn-in, you know? Because we\u2019re going to tell the truth. What, don\u2019t you believe me? That hurts.\u00a0That really hurts.\u201d\nThe coalition also wants a separate commissioner for Manitoba.\nThe inquiry is still planning to move ahead with its work as planned, including nine hearings this fall beginning in September in Thunder Bay, Ont.\nThe federal government gave the commissioners a budget of about\u00a0$53.8 million and asked them to complete their work by the end of 2018, with an interim report due in November.\nBuller has already indicated more time and funding will be required but a formal application has yet to be filed to the federal government.\n\u00a0\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

It\u2019s the conclusion of more than two years of research involving at least 2,380 people who shared their stories or artwork with the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and\u00a0Girls. At a ceremony detailing the findings early Monday in Gatineau, Quebec, Indigenous community members cheered and wept. Indigenous peoples in Canada have long expressed frustration that violent acts against their communities were not adequately investigated by\u00a0authorities. The National Inquiry\u2019s full report, which runs over 1,000 pages, also highlights violence against indigenous 2SLGBTQQIA people, which stands for Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex and\u00a0asexual. \u201cThe significant, persistent and deliberate pattern of systemic racial and gendered, human and Indigenous rights violations and abuses \u2014 perpetuated historically and maintained today by the Canadian state, designed to displace Indigenous Peoples from their lands, social structures and governance and to eradicate their existence as Nations, communities, families and individuals \u2014 is the cause of the disappearances, murders and violence experienced by Indigenous women, girls, 2SLGBTQQIA people, and this is genocide,\u201d Chief Commissioner Marion Buller said at the\u00a0ceremony.The steps to end the violence, the report states, \u201cmust be no less monumental than the combination of systems and actions that has worked to maintain colonial violence for\u00a0generations.\u201dThe inquiry was a campaign promise by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who took part in Monday\u2019s ceremony.  In a statement, Trudeau said his government would thoroughly review the report and \u201cdevelop and implement a National Action Plan to address violence against Indigenous women, girls, and LGBTQ and two-spirit\u00a0people.\u201d The inquiry put forward a lengthy list of recommendations, named Calls for Justice, that it said Canada has a \u201clegal imperative\u201d to implement. Trudeau vowed that the government will turn these demands into \u201creal, meaningful, Indigenous-led\u00a0action.\u201dThe prime minister also said his government has already begun taking steps to protect Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA people, including reforming Canada\u2019s criminal justice\u00a0system.As NPR has reported, a 2014 study by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police found that nearly 1,200 Indigenous women were murdered or went missing between 1980 and 2012, and government ministers have said they believe the actual number is far\u00a0higher. The National Inquiry didn\u2019t quantify the number of the missing and murdered in Canada, instead concluding that \u201cthousands of women\u2019s deaths or disappearances have likely gone unrecorded over the\u00a0decades.\u201d The report views the violence as a product of a long history of oppression. \u201cViolence against Indigenous women and girls is a crisis centuries in the making,\u201d the reports states. \u201cThe process of colonization has, in fact, created the conditions for the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA people that we are confronting\u00a0today.\u201dTrauma from government policies toward the indigenous community, it says, are a catalyst for violence \u2014 policies such as separating children from their families and forcing children to attend government-sponsored schools for purposes of assimilation. Violence also stemmed from the economic and social marginalization of these communities, and a lack of will by government and other institutions to make concrete\u00a0reforms.  \u201cIn the justice system, the health care system, child welfare, and in other situations, witnesses commonly described an institutional culture that makes women and 2SLGBTQQIA people feel as though the violence they\u2019re experiencing is due to their own personal failings, rather than recognizing that these challenges are a reflection of the way their own institutions contribute to colonial violence,\u201d the report\u00a0states. The government has not listened enough to indigenous community members and what they think might help to end the violence, according to the inquiry. The dozens of recommendations put forward ranged from global to local in scope \u2014 such as calling on the government to fulfill its obligations under international law or asking Canadian officials to help provide access for Indigenous communities to connect with their own\u00a0cultures. The report also urged the government to prioritize funding for and civilian oversight of Indigenous policing, and to weigh violence against Indigenous women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA people more heavily in criminal sentencing.

it is a sociological issue,\u201d said the report. \u201cThe recommendations that are repeated time and again in so many of the reports highlight exactly why and inquiry is needed: to ascertain the extent to which these recommendations have been implemented and to identify and address obstacles to implementation.\u201d\nThe report said that many of the studies \u201cstress that the economic and social marginalization of Indigenous women makes them more susceptible to violence and less able to escape violent circumstances.\u201d\nThe LSC report found that many of the studies found that a toxic mix of family breakdowns, overcrowded housing, food insecurity, lack of access to education and chronic underfunding for services targeting Indigenous women increased their exposure and vulnerability to violence.\nAdded to this is the continuing racism and sexism in Canada, the legacies of colonialism, the shadow of residential schools and discriminatory legislation like the Indian Act.\n\u201cAnd yet, police and health care professionals fail to adequately prioritize the health and safety of Indigenous women and a lack of culturally sensitive programs prevent the services that already exist from addressing challenges specific to Indigenous women\u2019s experiences,\u201d said the report.\nExecutive Summary of LSC report\n\nDownload (PDF, 2.64MB)\nThe report was released a day before a planned roundtable on murdered and missing Indigenous women that will include federal and provincial premiers and cabinet ministers along with Indigenous leaders and the families of victims.\nThe roundtable aims to hammer out a strategy to stem the disproportionate level of violence faced by Indigenous women.\nLSC includes a number of First Nation, universities and human rights organizations including Amnesty International, the Nova Scotia Native Women\u2019s Association, Dalhousie University, University of Saskatchewan, Aboriginal Legal Services Toronto and the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies, among others.\nnews@aptn.ca\n@APTNNews\n\n\nTags: AFN, Amnesty International, Dalhousie University, Legal Strategy Coalition on Violence Against Indigenous Women, mmiw, Murdered and Missing Indigenous women, Ottawa, our stories, Politics, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, roundtable, University of Saskatchewan\n\n\n\nAPTN National News\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tView all posts by APTN National News \u2192 \n\n\n\n\nFamilies of MMIW begin meeting in Ottawa to address crisis\n#MMIW family gathering & racism in minor hockey InFocus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisqus_hsTNA60RrW\n\n\n\nJust as I thought.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/John WoodsWINNIPEG  \u2013  Commissioners from the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women are encouraging people to support the family of 15-year-old Tina Fontaine while jurors decide whether the man accused of killing her is guilty.\n\u201cNothing is more heartbreaking than the loss of a loved one and tragically this is not an isolated case,\u201d said the statement released by Marion Buller, who is leading the inquiry, and commissioners Michele Audette, Quajaq Robinson and Bryan Eyolfson.\n\u201cThe violent end of this beautiful young Anicinabe woman\u2019s life is a tragedy that hurts us all,\u201d it said.\n\u201cTina\u2019s death woke up the nation to the issues of violence and marginalization Indigenous women and girls are subjected to.\u201d\nJurors resumed deliberations Thursday morning at the trial of Raymond Cormier, who is accused of killing Tina and dumping her body in Winnipeg\u2019s Red River.\nCormier, 56, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder.\nTina\u2019s body  \u2013  wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down with rocks  \u2013  was found eight days after she was reported missing in August 2014.\nHer death reignited calls for the national inquiry, that is now holding cross-country hearings led by Buller.\nManitoba Chief Justice Glenn Joyal spent three hours Wednesday instructing the jury on key issues in the case and how to come to a decision.\nHe explained that there are only two questions that the jurors need answer.\n\u201cUnless you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt the Crown has proved that Tina Fontaine\u2019s death was caused by an unlawful act, and that the accused Raymond Cormier committed the unlawful act, you must find Raymond Cormier not guilty of second-degree murder. Your deliberations will be over,\u201d Joyal said.\n\u201cIf you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt Raymond Cormier committed the unlawful act that caused the death of Tina Fontaine, you must find Raymond Cormier guilty of second-degree murder as charged.\u201d\nThe jury has heard that Tina was raised by her great-aunt on the Sagkeeng First Nation, 120 kilometres north of Winnipeg, but went to the city to visit her mother. It was there that the girl became an exploited youth.\nCourt was told there were no witnesses to Tina\u2019s death and no DNA linking her to the accused. Experts testified they don\u2019t know how she died.\nCrown prosecutors said the teen was killed and dumped in the river by Cormier, who had sex with her and later found out she was a minor.\nJoyal urged the jurors to listen to each other while discussing the case.\n\u201cThe jury\u2019s decision is a group decision. Everyone has a say and an equal say. Your duty is to consult with each other. The verdict must be based on the facts as you find them,\u201d he said.\n \u2013  Follow @BillGraveland on Twitter\nShare this story:\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n\n Twitter\n Facebook\n Instagram\n YouTube\n Tumblr\n\n\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nArchive\n \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nThe Medicine Hat News\nOther Publications\n Contact\nCareers\n \n\n\nContact the Medicine Hat News\n\n3257 Dunmore Rd SE\n\t\t\t\t\tMedicine Hat, AB T1B 3R2\n[P] 403.527.1101\n[F] 403.528.5696\n\n\nContact\nCareers\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrint Advertising: 403.528.5659\n\t\t\t\t\tNational Advertising: 403.528.5766\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Advertising: 403.528.5698\n\t\t\t\t\tClassifieds: 403.526.7653\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2018 The Medicine Hat News, A Division of Continental Newspapers Canada Ltd.\nAdvertising\nTerms and Conditions & Privacy policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

THE CANADIAN PRESS/John WoodsWINNIPEG - Recent acquittals in the high-profile deaths of two young Indigenous people have some of their peers across Canada questioning whether reconciliation is possible.\"I feel scared. I feel scared for urban Indigenous young people who are affected by too many systems that fail them,\" said Michael Redhead Champagne, 30, an organizer with Aboriginal Youth Opportunities in Winnipeg.\"I am nervous for all of my relatives who are wrapped up in a justice system that doesn't know what that word means.\"Last month, a jury found Raymond Cormier not guilty in the 2014 death of 15-year-old Tina Fontaine. Her body was found wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down with rocks in Winnipeg's Red River.Less than two weeks earlier, a Saskatchewan jury found Gerald Stanley not guilty in the 2016 killing of 22-year-old Colten Boushie, who was shot after the vehicle he was in drove onto Stanley's farm.Both verdicts brought people into the streets to protest.The Ontario First Nations Young Peoples Council said the verdicts highlight the \"systemic racism that is pervading the Canadian justice system.\" The Canadian Roots Exchange, a group of Indigenous and non-Indigenous youth dedicated to reconciliation, posted a statement saying \"racism, colonialism and white supremacy continue to thrive.\"Champagne said it's hard to have faith in a justice system that ignores countless reports and recommendations, including the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry from 1991, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples from 1996 and calls to action by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.It's time for action, he said.\"I want the justice system in Canada in general to quit asking Indigenous people what we need, because we have already told you,\" he said. \"Right now, we can't have a conversation about reconciliation in this country until we feel that there is justice.\"Brendin Beaulieu, an 18-year-old Winnipeg high school student, is preparing for graduation. The six-foot-five teenager who likes to make music in his spare time said he has to deal with a \"broken heart\" as he grapples with \"knowing there are things we can do but it's going to take time.\"Vitriol online shows there's a lot of talking about Indigenous youth but not nearly enough listening to them, Beaulieu said.Jada Ross, 17, goes to a different high school across the city, but is having similar conversations with her friends and family. She said they are scared and saddened but determined to make change.Lauren Chopek, 21, knows all too well how vulnerable Tina was on the city's streets.Chopek was sexually exploited as a teenager. Now, she runs the Midnight Medicine Walk to help others in the same position. She said it feels as if Indigenous people have been asking for justice for a long time, but it's essential Canada hears it.\"I've been there in her shoes, and also misjudged and just ignored as a person on the street, being a child that needs to be somewhere safe. I needed help and I just got judged,\" she said.\"Why are we always the ones standing up for ourselves? How come there is no one else vouching for us?\"\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAdvertise With Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Error\nSubmit a Tip\nRefundRefund\n\n\n\nThe Winnipeg Free Press is not accepting comments on this story.\nWhy aren't comments accepted on this story?

Advisory Council on the Status of Women, receives her purple ribbon from Michelle Jay, program co-ordinator for the P.E.I. Advisory Council on the Status of Women, at their pinning bee event at the Confederation Centre Public Library on Tuesday, Nov. 5. - Ernesto Carranza\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHARLOTTETOWN, P.E.I. \u2014 \nWhen she first heard about the 14 students, all women, who were gunned down in their engineering class at l\u2019\u00c9cole Polytechnique, Michelle Jay remembers where she was.\nShe was a student herself at UPEI on Dec. 6, 1989.\u00a0\nJay imagined what it was like to be in that class room when the shooter came in with his gun and told the men to leave and the women to stay.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was a horrible event for Montreal, but it was also indicative of violence that affects women all across the country. It was truly a shocking event.\u201d\nIt is still shocking for Jay, but looking back now, it was a poignant time for her and for the women around her.\n\u201cLater that same year, we had heard a couple of stories of sexual assaults around campus, so a little bunch of us advocated for a women\u2019s centre.\n\u201cBecause women (were not) safe ... we needed to talk to about the threats and how women aren\u2019t being treated equally,\" she said, adding that a women\u2019s centre eventually opened up and operated for many years because of their efforts.\nNow, as the program co-ordinator for the P.E.I. Advisory Council on the Status of Women, Jay continues to help work toward ensuring a better world for women.\nOn Nov. 5, the P.E.I. Advisory Council on the Status of Women hosted an evening pinning bee to prepare ribbons and bookmarks for its Purple Ribbon Campaign Against Violence Against Women.\nThe pinning bee was held at the Confederation Centre Public Library with the 2019-2020 theme of \u201cSUPPORTING SURVIVORS\u2014Support the person. Involve the community. Right the world.\u201d\n\n\nAround 30 people, all women and girls, attended the event on Tuesday, Nov. 6. Ernesto Carranza/The Guardian\n\n\nThis year will mark the 30th anniversary of the Montreal Massacre.\n\n\u201cIt is a day to be really, really sad,\u201d said Jay.\nThe advisory council holds a vigil each year at Memorial Hall of the Confederation Centre of the Arts for women who have been murdered by gender-based violence.\nAround 30 people, all women and girls, were at the library, helping with pins and ribbons.\nAnnually, volunteers cut more than 17,000 ribbons and pin them to information cards to be distributed across the Island.\u00a0\nThe purple ribbons are worn in honour and remembrance of the 14 women killed in the Montreal Massacre and the 10 women murdered on P.E.I. since 1989 by someone who knew them, said Jay.\n\u201cWe also wear purple ribbons as a call for justice for the thousands of murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls (MMIWG) in Canada,\u201d she said.\nThe final report from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murder Indigenous Women came out on June 3 of this year, and it could not provide \"a reliable estimate of the numbers of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA persons in Canada\".\n\u201cWe continue to strive as (a council) to make a difference and make a change to improve the lives of women everywhere.\u201d\nAnna Sophia Ledwell-MacInnis, 12, has been coming to the pinning bee with her mom since she could remember.\n\u201cIt is important for the community to get together and learn about things like this,\u201d she said.\nAnna Sophia said all people should keep fighting to remember women who have died because of gender-based violence and change the future for girls like her and women like her mom.\nShe plans to keep coming back as long as she can.\n\u201cBecause if there is not a community effort, then nothing is going to get done. This is important for everybody.\u201d\nTwitter.com/Ernesto_Carranz\n\n\n\nOn a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend The Guardian?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Local stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                Disturbance in Charlottetown leads to charges\n                            \n\nPublished 32 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                Charlottetown man faces drunk driving charge\n                            \n\nPublished 42 minutes ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                Charlottetown councillor suggests meeting with police, fire\n                            \n\nPublished 1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                Charlottetown traffic advisory: Lane Closure on Riverside Drive\n                            \n\nPublished 1 hour ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                French-language enrolments continue to rise on P.E.I.\n                            \n\nPublished 2 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                P.E.I. women prepare ribbons, bookmarks to mark anniversary of Montreal Massacre\n                            \n\nUpdated 3 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                P.E.I. mother sues French language school board for inaction over students bullying her son\n                            \n\nUpdated 4 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                P.E.I. weather, travel updates for Thursday, Nov. 7\n                            \n\nUpdated 5 hours ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        Egypt, Ethiopia, Sudan to try to resolve dam dispute by January 15: Treasury\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        Meghan Markle makes first visit to Westminster Abbey's Field of Remembrance\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        Exclusive: KKR's new Asia-focused fund targets record $15 billion in 2020 -

The forum would look to how the city and community can take action on the report\u2019s recommendations.\n\n\n\n  article continues below\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\nCourt Docket: June 3 - 7\nWestJet eyes Fort St. John as a hub\nRural directors will recommend rescinding bylaw\nShaw cuts cord to Peace Region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u201cWhat can we do as a community to address (those recommendations)?\u201d Mayor Lori Ackerman said.\n The national inquiry\u2019s final report was released last week after years of study and testimony documenting the causes and impacts of violence of against indigenous women and girls.\n\n Among the report's 231 recommendations are calls for a national Indigenous- and human-rights ombudsperson and a national Indigenous- and human-rights tribunal, increased funding for education, health and wellness programs and services aimed at indigenous women and girls, and improved public transportation in rural areas. The inquiry also raised concerns about the\u00a0\"urgent need\" to consider the safety of Indigenous women in all stages of resource extraction projects.\n The city will need to gauge the interest and willingness of First Nation communities in participating, Ackerman said.\n Ackerman noted there\u2019s grant funding available through the Union of BC Municipalities to host a community to community forums, Ackerman said, noting she sees the community discussion being more than just one event. The biggest cost would be bringing in an expert to explain the report and its recommendations, Ackerman said.\n Last week, more than 150 people took part in the city\u2019s first annual Moose Hide walk calling for an end to violence against children. The city also took part in a reception in Victoria hosted by Lieutenant Governor Janet Austin to commemorate the release of the inquiry's report.\n Missing and murdered Indigenous women are believed to number in the thousands in Canada, but the national inquiry\u2019s report says that despite the commission's best efforts to quantify the extent of the tragedy, \"no one knows an exact number.\"\n The inquiry, started in 2016, labelled the issue a \u201cdeliberate race, identity and gender-based genocide\u201d, and the result of a \"persistent and deliberate pattern of systemic racial and gendered human and Indigenous rights violations and abuses, perpetuated historically and maintained today by the Canadian state.\"\n The term genocide has become a flashpoint of national discussion.\n Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stopped short of using the term in responding to the report, but said he accepted the inquiry\u2019s findings. \"Time and again, we have heard of their disappearance, violence, or even death being labelled low priority or ignored,\" he said.\n Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer disagreed with the inquiry's use of the word. \u201cThe ramifications of the term 'genocide' are very profound,\u201d he said. \u201cThat word and term carries a lot of meaning. I think the tragedy involved with missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls is its own thing, it is its own tragedy, and does not fall into that category of genocide.\"\n Ackerman didn\u2019t wade into that debate Monday, saying, \u201cthat\u2019s a pay scale above our level; we\u2019re going to work community to community.\u201d\n \u2014 with files from the Canadian Press\n Email Managing Editor Matt Preprost at editor@ahnfsj.ca\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright  Alaska Highway News\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              Comments\n          \n\n          \t  \t\t\t\tNOTE: To post a comment you must have an account with at least one of the following services:\n                  Disqus, Facebook, Twitter, Google+\n                  You may then login using your account credentials for that service.\n                  If you do not already have an account you may register a new profile with Disqus\n                  by first clicking the \"Post as\" button and then the link: \"Don't have one?

They agreed to meet again before the end of 2016.\n\nPolice have been accused of lackluster investigations into the murders and disappearances because the victims are aboriginal and the stereotypes of aboriginals being drunks and prostitutes persists in some minds.\n\n\u0093I\u0092ve seen the systemic racism,\u0094 Marion Horne, vice-president of the Native Women\u0092s Association of Canada, said after the conference. She said the lack of a national inquiry into 1,200 missing and murdered women is unconscionable.\n\n\u0093There\u0092s something wrong in our society \u0085 we do nothing about it,\u0094 Horne said during a live interview. \u0093Why are our women going missing and murdered?\u0094\n\nAt a parallel meeting taking place nearby, other victims\u0092 families and native leaders gathered and some shouted \u0093Shame on Canada.\u0094\n\nC.J. Julian, whose sister was one of serial killer Robert Pickton\u0092s approximately 50 aboriginal victims a decade ago, said the treatment of aboriginals as second-class citizens has to change.\n\n\u0093This is a life and death matter, and it has to stop,\u0094 she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as she pleaded for aboriginal women to be treated as equals. \u0093I am not a drunk.

Those came not least from the families of victims, who alleged a lack of empathy compounded by endless staff turnover, a glacial pace of evidence-gathering and a lack of transparency. This week CBC reported the inquiry also made some very basic factual errors.\nThe final report alleges \u201cIndigenous women and girls now make up almost 25 per cent of homicide victims,\u201d when of course it\u2019s 25 per cent of female homicide victims. In her preface, commissioner Mich\u00e8le Audette claims \u201cstatistics show \u2026 Indigenous women and girls are 12 times more likely to be murdered or missing than any other women in Canada.\u201d Statistics Canada pegs it at around 2.7 times more likely.\n\u201cWe were on the ground, we were with the families,\u201d Audette explained. \u201cSometimes we were able to see that numbers don\u2019t connect to the reality on the ground.\u201d\nThis validated widespread concerns that the inquiry was disastrously uninterested in collecting actual data about victims, perpetrators and circumstances, but it gets worse: Corrections made to the report in light of CBC\u2019s inquiries are not annotated, nor have they been included in all versions \u2014 including the official one filed with the government.\nSome are understandably worried the inquiry\u2019s useful findings might be overshadowed by such blunders. But if anything I think it could be a useful reminder, because the discussion following the report\u2019s release came nowhere near running its course. At one point, amid much waffling, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau literally copped to Canada committing genocide under his watch: \u201cWe accept the finding that this was genocide, and we will move forward to end this ongoing national tragedy.\u201d\nAnd then \u2026 nothing. We are about to have an election campaign in which a head of government has admitted at the very least to failing to prevent genocide \u2014 itself a breach of international law, putting Trudeau\u2019s Canada in the same league as Slobodan Milosevic\u2019s Serbia. A lot of perfectly mainstream jurists and commentators said they agreed with this. And now, bupkes.\nI suspect a lot of people who claim to support the inquiry\u2019s findings are rolling their eyes at this point. It\u2019s not, you know, GENOCIDE-genocide. Justin Trudeau\u2019s not going to wind up in The Hague, for heaven\u2019s sake.\nAll I can say is read the report. Its legal analysis concedes \u201cthere is little precedent in international law for situations where the state is the perpetrator of genocide through structural violence, such as colonialism,\u201d but it very much implicates Canada in GENOCIDE-genocide, \u201cin breach of (its) international obligations, triggering its responsibility under international law.\u201d\nFew commentators seemed to have read that part. After the report\u2019s release, some asked why Indigenous people shouldn\u2019t be allowed to define the terms of their own terrible mistreatment \u2014 but the report is concerned specifically with the UN Convention. Others found themselves defending historical events as genocide or \u201ccultural genocide,\u201d which is a much easier case to make \u2014 just not the report\u2019s case. Nearly everyone \u2014 including, you will note above, the authors of the report\u2019s legal analysis \u2014 found themselves supporting the charge of genocide against Indigenous people, rather than against women.\nThey found themselves doing all that because the inquiry\u2019s case for an ongoing genocide against Indigenous people in general, and Indigenous women specifically, was a hopelessly dodgy, ill-advised distraction. Even if you can accept that when Indigenous men murder Indigenous women they do so as unwitting agents of genocidal Canadian colonialism, Indigenous men are murdered roughly three times more often than Indigenous women.\nMost ridiculous were the folks who ostensibly supported the report\u2019s findings but accused skeptics of getting too hung up on the genocide thing. \u201cLet\u2019s not obsess about who did what to whom in Srebrenica,\u201d nobody ever said. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal whether Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic calls it \u2018genocide\u2019 or \u2018a crime,\u2019\u201d nobody added in 2013 when Nikolic apologized only for the latter. Just because you\u2019re accusing a person or entity of a novel kind of genocide doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t accusing them of something that needs answering for. It\u2019s a big word for a reason.\nThe fact Trudeau was able to shrug the accusation away may well be evidence of Canadians\u2019 apathy or antipathy toward Indigenous people. But it is certainly evidence that the inquiry swung for the fences and whiffed. There is indeed lots else in the report about how to prevent Indigenous women from going missing and being murdered, but it\u2019s nothing we didn\u2019t know before: Better housing, education and health, more job opportunities, higher incomes and happier lives lead to all the better outcomes we\u2019re after.\nThat progress has been in many cases so slow is a national shame, and normally I would say we can\u2019t be reminded of that often enough. But this hopelessly misbegotten, mismanaged and incurious inquiry may well have made things worse.\n\u2022 Email: cselley@nationalpost.com | Twitter: cselley \nCopyright Postmedia Network Inc., 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore National Perspectives stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                CHRISTIE BLATCHFORD: Appeal court got it wrong: Via Rail bombers received a fair trial\n                            \n\nUpdated a day ago\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                                \n                                CHRIS SELLEY: Politicians say they won't prop up a minority government?

But one\u00a017-year-old Lake County senior is stepping out of the \"teenage comfort zone\" to make a\u00a0 very adult statement about unsolved murders among Native American women and girls. Reporter\u00a0Jill Valley found out\u00a0how she's sharing that message through art and activism.Marita Growing Thunder makes the most of her clothes --\u00a0and that sets her apart from other students at Polson High School.\"This is how my grandmas used to dress in high school and I feel this is how I should dress\", she said.Marita is\u00a0wearing her regalia her entire senior year, not just to honor her ancestors, but also to honor other Native American women, and girls specifically -- the thousands who've been murdered or who are missing across Canada and the United States.It's an issue that for many that\u00a0isn't generating the concern it should -- and Marita\u00a0wants to change that.\"Nobody is paying attention. Some are trying to speak up, but they're being turned away. It really got me upset and the only way to express my sadness was through my art.\" she explained.Marita's art includes bead-work and symbols sacred to her culture. She has about 20 different dresses so far this school year.Her message resonates in the halls of Polson High School, but through Facebook, that message has a larger reach -- inspiring people in Montana and across the country.\"A\u00a0lady in Oklahoma contacted me, and another is wearing a dress for her cousin. [Salish Kootenai College] is doing one day a week -- and so is my mom,\" Marita said.\"Marita has always been strong and determined and interested in making a positive impact in the world,\" SKC Upward Bound instructor Joanne Morrow told MTN News.Marita is a strong young woman, bravely taking a stand against unspeakable crimes against women who cry out for justice:\u00a0\"I only have my mother and sister in my life. It hurts my heart to see other people who have not have the feeling of family or of love.\"Click here\u00a0for \u00a0more on Marita's cause and to learn more about missing and murdered indigenous women in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tWEATHER\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave Location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Weather\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular StoriesMost Popular StoriesMore>>\n2 people charged in connection with stabbing death of Great Falls teen2 people charged in connection with stabbing death of Great Falls teenUpdated: Monday, September 26 2016 3:20 PM EDT2016-09-26 19:20:03 GMTCoombs is charged with tampering with evidence; assault with a weapon by accountability; and solicitation to commit distribution of dangerous drugs.Brianna Coombs and Joseph Knowles have been charged in connection with the death of Great Falls teen Megan Meriwether.Gates charged with assaultGates charged with assaultUpdated: Monday, September 26 2016 7:25 PM EDT2016-09-26 23:25:36 GMTBarry Gates of\u00a0HelenaGates, 25 years old, is charged with aggravated assault and partner/family member assault, both felonies.

We have heard directly from families of (missing and murdered indigenous women) they are quickly losing hope that your inquiry will actually be relevant to them,\u201d states the letter, dated last Wednesday.\u201cWe call on you to, at a minimum, announce in the near future when you, as commissioners, will finally go out and listen to our people.\u201dRead more: Article Continued BelowInquiry into murdered and missing indigenous women and girls hits roadblocks before it startsMissing, murdered women\u2019s inquiry frustrating families, advocates sayOntario opens support centres for families of murdered and missing indigenous womenInquiry officials announced April 13 that they were postponing a series of regional advisory meetings, which were supposed to help determine what issues should be covered when the formal hearings get underway.Since then, the Manitoba coalition said there has been no communication. The group is also worried many family members may have a hard time being included in the hearings.\u201cYou have not yet initiated meetings with Manitoba survivors of violence or who were missing, families of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls, as well as First Nations and communities that are part of your mandate,\u201d the letter states.A spokesperson for the inquiry commission said Monday the advisory hearings were put on pause to look at possible changes for the inquiry hearings, and the May start date is still a go.\u201cThe message we received is that we must be flexible and be prepared to change course if need be. This time is an opportunity for us to reflect on our approach for future truth-finding gatherings,\u201d Tiar Wilson wrote in an email.The uncertainty over how families across Canada may be ensured participation in the inquiry has led some indigenous leaders to call for the inquiry to be postponed.Eric Robinson, former deputy premier and aboriginal affairs minister of Manitoba, said a delay is warranted to ensure the inquiry is fair and thorough.\u201cLet\u2019s not do a job that\u2019s in half-measures. I think that it\u2019s got to be done in a thorough fashion and there\u2019s got to be satisfaction ... for the families,\u201d Robinson said.Grand Chief Sheila North Wilson, who represents First Nations in northern Manitoba, said the process so far has been troublesome.\u201cI still believe that it should take place and that they should go forward and I respect the fact that they\u2019re being flexible,\u201d she said.\u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m worried that the families ... are losing a little bit of faith in the process because there seem to be some false starts.\u201dDelivered dailyThe Morning Headlines\u00a0NewsletterSubscribeThe Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E\u00a01E6.

CTV News reports that the mission is either to have begun this investigation on or prior to this date, given its significance and the fact that this project has been a long time coming. It will reportedly be in full swing by the spring of 2016.\nA statement was issued by Canada\u2019s Indigenous and Northern Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett, who ensured the public that their first step would be to contact\u00a0the families and loved ones of those who either lost their life or have not yet been found, in order to make sure they are fully engaged and involved in the process. Following this, engagement will be made with members of various Aboriginal communities, bringing in experts and residents alike to join forces on this campaign to bring justice for these women at last.\nCanada\u2019s Federal Government to Investigate Missing/Murdered Aboriginal Women\nThe relatives of these victimized females are said to be \u201crelieved\u201d that some effort is finally being put in by Canada\u2019s political power figures to rectify this issue, as they feel it has gone unheeded for many years now and passed off as being a \u201cless important\u201d issue to the demographic it affects.\nWarren Goulding\u2019s 2001\u2019s non-fiction book titled Just Another Indian provides a hard-hitting insight into this notion, stating that the death of any Aboriginal person is considered by Canada\u2019s politicians to be of far less significance than that of any other race, most particularly white people. He goes in depth, pointing to the fact that those in power seem to find it acceptable reasoning to suggest that due to many of these women living \u201chigh-risk lifestyles, engaging in prostitution, being runaways etc, there is nothing that can be done about this crime and, in essence, it is to be expected. The notion that perhaps, if Aboriginal people, especially women, were given the same opportunities that other racial minorities were they would not have to resort to such ways of life, is ignored by the government completely in Goulding\u2019s eyes.\nEver since the induction of a new Liberal government on October 19, when Justin Trudeau won over Canada\u2019s public with an overwhelming majority, pushing out decade-long Prime Minister Stephen Harper, much more attention has been focused on both solving and preventing Aboriginal crime, with the 43-year-old making sure to employ a significant amount of Indigenous cabinet minister\u2019s on November 4, as well as other racial minorities in order to ensure that the government was well-balanced with men, women, and various races so that the knowledge and viewpoints of all could work together to make the country a better place.\nThe full list of his cabinet, which consists of 50 percent women, can be found here. When asked by a reporter why he choose to split the gender right down the middle and for what reason this was important to him, Trudeau gave a powerful and some feel most reminiscent of his late father, also a Prime Minister, statement, \u201cBecause it\u2019s 2015.\u201d\nWill Justin Trudeau\u2019s new government be skilled enough to pull off this investigation and finally bring some peace to the families of all the women who have died or disappeared since 1980, which includes 1,017 homicide victims and 164 missing females?

They have not said when a new executive will be hired.\nThe Native Women's Association of Canada says a several other executives and staff have quit in recent months, and families need reassurance that the national inquiry is not in jeopardy.\nThe inquiry already held a session with families in Whitehorse in the spring, but has yet to schedule dates in other communities.\nThe association's president, Francyne Joe, says this could be a pivotal moment to bring in new leadership as the inquiry reviews its process.\nOfficials with the national inquiry did not respond to requests for comment.\nJoe suggested that the\u00a0new executive director should either be two-spirited, transgender or\u00a0a woman with Indigenous ties, adding that the position should be filled\u00a0before\u00a0September.\n\"I don't think we need to see another lawyer filling this type of position,\" she said.\u00a0\"We need to see somebody who is well organized, who is able to communicate on a normal, one-to-one basis with families.\"\nJoe said there are leaders\u00a0within Indigenous communities who would be strong candidates for the job.\nShe\u00a0said the meetings with families in Yukon went well but those people need to know they'll continue to receive support.\n\"I think the commissioners need to come out immediately and have a proper press release so they can reassure families that they are still going to be moving forward,\" she said.\n____\nBy Linda Givetash in Vancouver\n\nThe Canadian Press\n \n \n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nCanadian doctor shot at New York hospital recovering after surgery, father says\n\n\n\n\nNext\nCleanup continues at derailed freight train site, oil spill\n\n\n\n \nRelated Articles\n\n\n\nCleanup continues at derailed freight train site, oil spill\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n\nCanadian doctor shot at New York hospital recovering after surgery, father says\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n\nGoFundMe campaign launched to help young siblings who survived deadly crash\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCBC Regional News \n\n\n\n\nCyclist injured by motorcyclist on Vancouver\u2019s North Shore\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSunny weather helping Fraser Valley farmers after soggy spring\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWildfire at Harrison Lake still burning out of control\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAdvocates seek Indigenous-focused addiction counselling centre for Vancouver\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\u2018Sick, sick, sick story\u2019: Family dog shot with nail gun\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHells Angel convicted in massive cocaine sting dies in Abbotsford prison\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCanada 150 won\u2019t leave much of a \u2018concrete\u2019 legacy, architects say\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nB.C. couple rediscovers Canada Centennial memorabilia\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n \n\nCanadian Press \n\n\nCleanup continues at derailed freight train site, oil spill\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\nIndigenous families need reassurance as inquiry director resigns, group says\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\nCanadian doctor shot at New York hospital recovering after surgery, father says\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\nGoFundMe campaign launched to help young siblings who survived deadly crash\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\nInitial findings from necropsies suggest blunt trauma for two whales in die-off\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\nCanadian woman and her husband found dead in New Mexico, state police say\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n \n\nCHEK Sports \n\n\n\n\nHarbourCats confident in second half surge\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPlays of the Week \u2013 July 3rd\n\nJuly 03, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGame On! \u2013 July 2nd, 2017\n\nJuly 02, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nJunior Premiere Eagles set to host Provincial Championships\n\nJuly 02, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nVictoria officially enters bid for 2022 Commonwealth Games\n\nJune 30, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHarbourCats win third straight in dramatic 9th inning walk-off\n\nJune 30, 2017\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nTop Stories \n\n\n\n\nBigger crowd, fewer arrests for Canada Day in Victoria compared to last year\n\nJuly 02, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nUPDATED WITH VIDEO: Hundreds attend Big Gay Dog Walk in Victoria\n\nJuly 02, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nVictoria welcomes 152 new Canadians in a special citizenship ceremony\n\nJuly 01, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nJohn Horgan will be first Victoria-based premier in 84 years\n\nJune 30, 2017\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSummer election?

She\u2019d been dead for nearly two months.\nCheryl McDonald remembers how desperate they had been. She spent hours\u00a0walking through the reeds on the outskirts of Akwesasne, restlessly scanning the field for some trace of her big sister.\nShe hoped to find a path in the grass, a set of footprints, anything. As she tracked\u00a0across the muddy soil, she kept thinking of what Carleen said the day she disappeared.\n\u201cShe told one of my sisters, \u2018Think of me when you smell sweet grass\u2019,\u201d Cheryl said. \u201cI know she was planning her end. She was trying to give us signs, and when my mom said she was missing, we knew she was lying out there, somewhere out there. We looked where the sweet grass was. In Akwesasne, it grows wherever there\u2019s water.\u201d\nIn the beginning, the search party\u00a0was exhaustive: Mohawk police patrolled the Akwesasne marshes on foot while the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec buzzed overhead in a helicopter. Canine units also scoured the territory.\nAfter three days, the group dwindled to neighbours, friends and family. Time wore on, the nights grew longer, the morning dew turned into frost as summer gave way to fall.\nThe McDonalds despaired: They visited seers and fortune tellers for a sign from beyond. But that only seemed to heighten tensions.\nThe end came seven weeks later, as they were nearing their breaking point.\n\u201cThe night after they took her out of the woods, it started snowing,\u201d Cheryl said. \u201cWe were exhausted, my sisters had missed work and left their families to find Carleen. Our husbands needed us, our children needed us, we couldn\u2019t have gone on for much longer. We needed some sort of closure.\u201d\nThe hunter found Carleen in the forest bed next to an empty bottle of rum. She was 25 years old.\nWhen they recovered her body, the medical examiner said she probably drank the rum, then fell into a deep sleep and died of exposure.\nJust before Carleen crept out of her parents\u2019 house and into the night on Sept. 4, 1988, she leaned over her 4-year-old daughter\u2019s bed and soothed her. It was one of the child\u2019s earliest memories.\nTwo days after she disappeared, her family rummaged through her things looking for a\u00a0hint that might lead them to Carleen. They found a letter stuffed in an envelope.\nIt was a suicide note.\n***\n\n\n\nCheryl McDonald, centre, is flanked by her mother, Agnes, and Viviane Michel, president of Quebec Native Women, at the release of a report on missing and murdered indigenous women in Kahnawake in December.\n\nPaul Chiasson /  \n\nThe Canadian Press\n\n\n\nIn death, Carleen became part of a troubling Canadian narrative: one of young aboriginal women whose lives were cut short\u00a0by violence.\nBetween 1980 and 2012, 1,181 aboriginal women disappeared or were murdered, according to the RCMP.\u00a0Aboriginal women are six times more likely to die from homicide than non-aboriginal women, according to Statistics Canada.\nCarleen\u2019s death might not have been a homicide\u00a0but her story will be recorded alongside hundreds of others this fall at the\u00a0National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women and Girls. Cheryl will testify at the public inquiry.\nThe $53-million inquiry will engrave\u00a0these women\u2019s stories into Canadian history, but it will also look at why so many indigenous women are affected by violence and how that trauma\u00a0ripples through their communities.\nLike many of the aboriginal women who died violently these past four decades, Carleen was a casualty of domestic abuse. The abuse\u00a0isolated her from her children, her sisters, her community and herself.\nShe sought comfort in the numbing effects of alcohol.\nIn speaking out about her big sister\u2019s death, Cheryl\u00a0has been embraced by a community that spans dozens of indigenous territories and cuts across generations to link families throughout Canada.\nBefore the inquiry was mandated by the Trudeau government in 2015, the families of Canada\u2019s missing and murdered aboriginal women found solace\u00a0with each other.\n\u201cThe people who have gone through this, they carried this pain alone for a very long time,\u201d said Mary Hannaburg, a board member of Quebec Native Women, one of the early proponents of a public inquiry. \u201cBut then they began to realize they weren\u2019t alone, that\u00a0there were so many others just like them. They formed a bond through this national tragedy.\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time for the whole country to listen. There might not always be an answer, we might not always figure out why this happens, but there can be healing and there can be closure.\u201d\n***\n\n\n\nCarleen McDonald (second from right) was a prankster in school, her sister Cheryl recalls, \u201cbut she was tough, too. She was stronger than me.\u201d Courtesy of Cheryl McDonald\n\n\n\nGrowing up, the four McDonald sisters\u00a0navigated between worlds.\nThey were raised\u00a0in upstate New York but spent summers with their Mohawk relatives in Kanesatake, near Montreal. They lived on Onondaga territory but attended school off-reserve, among the white children in\u00a0Lafayette, N.Y.\nCheryl\u2019s father, a Korean War veteran, was an ironworker. He plied his trade on bridges and office buildings near the family home. Her mom took odd jobs cleaning homes in nearby Syracuse.\nAt Lafayette High School, Carleen earned a reputation as a prankster.\nOne afternoon, in a bit of mischief gone awry, Carleen accidentally locked herself in her own locker.\u00a0\n\u201cWe heard a pounding noise in the hallway and the teacher ran out of the classroom to see what it was,\u201d Cheryl said. \u201cSure enough, it was her, she was hiding in her locker waiting to jump out at her friends. But somebody saw the locker door open and just shut it.\n\u201cShe was funny, rambunctious, but she was tough, too. She was stronger than me. She used to wrestle with me to toughen me up. She was such a tomboy. She made me strong, too.\u201d\nCarleen was 15\u00a0when she met her future husband. He was 25 and fresh out of the United States Army.\nCheryl likes to say her sister fell in love with his good side: kind-hearted, charming and educated. He\u2019d also trained as a millwright and seemed like the kind of man who could provide for a family.\nBut there was a dark a side to him as well.\n\u201cAs hard as we had it growing up, it was worse for him,\u201d said Cheryl, who asked that his name not be published out of respect for her family. \u201cHis family was evicted from the Onondaga (aboriginal) territory because his mother was white. He came back into town as a teenager and his own cousins jumped him.\u201d\nCarleen gave birth to the couple\u2019s first child, a boy, when she was 16. The couple eventually rented a place in Syracuse and Carleen\u2019s parents moved back to Akwesasne.\nCheryl says she started to notice things get bad after her nephew was born.\n\u201cWhen the baby had a bruise, it was, \u2018Babies fall. It happens.\u2019 It was overlooked,\u201d Cheryl said. \u201cAnd then I remember (her second child), another baby, she\u2019s crying in her crib and my sister won\u2019t tend to her. \u2026 He wouldn\u2019t let her go to the baby. He said, \u2018That baby is spoiled.\u2019\n\u201cWhen I had children of my own, I wouldn\u2019t leave them (at Carleen\u2019s),\u201d she said. \u201cHer kid is playing outside, something happens, this kid is terrified, running through the house, and it\u2019s not a predator chasing them, it\u2019s their father, chasing them into a closet. They were terrified of that man.\n\u201cHe was in the army, my husband was in the army, my father was, a lot of our men have this pain that they bring home.\u00a0And who\u2019s around them? Us, their children, their wives, their siblings, their friends. Everybody knows and nobody knows. That\u2019s the thing about domestic violence.\u201d\nCheryl remembers trying to be stern with her sister, begging her to leave her husband and forge a new, safer home for the children.\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned people will take a little bit of love even if the rest is bad, they\u2019ll still cling to that love,\u201d Cheryl says. \u201cMy sister met him when she was just a child. He was all she ever knew. I imagine the thought of living without him was scary.\u201d\nThough there are few\u00a0comprehensive studies comparing rates of domestic violence among aboriginal and non-aboriginal families, the available data suggest a significant imbalance.\u00a0A Statistics Canada 1999 survey found that 25 per cent of aboriginal women reported experiencing violence from a current or former partner \u2014 that\u2019s about three times higher than in non-aboriginal communities.\nThere isn\u2019t one explanation that accounts for this statistical gap, but a 2003 report by the Aboriginal Healing Foundation points to multiple factors.\nThe residential school experience \u2014 which saw tens of thousands of indigenous children taken from their families, beaten and molested in state-run schools \u2014 instilled a pattern of\u00a0abuse\u00a0in thousands of families across Canada. Often that violence was handed down through generations.\nThe report also outlines the \u201cwholeness of aboriginal history,\u201d wherein the federal government, using the threat of military violence, subjected entire\u00a0territories\u00a0to cruel and unfair treatment. The result was that this brutality was replicated\u00a0within the communities themselves.\nBoth Carleen and her partner\u2019s families had, to some degree, experienced this pattern of violence.\n\u201cViolence is often a response to trauma, it can be passed down across generations,\u201d said Hannaburg, who also works as a therapist at the Kanesatake Health Centre. \u201cPeople turn that violence against their spouses, their children and, in many cases, they turn that violence against themselves.\n\u201cPart of the work of the public inquiry will be to try to break that cycle. I don\u2019t know if this inquiry can do that but it has to try if things are going to get better.\u201d\nAs Carleen\u2019s life continued to unravel, the sisters drifted apart.\nCheryl moved north to Kanesatake and started her own family.\u00a0Carleen separated from her husband in 1988 and took the kids to her parents\u2019 house in Akwesasne.\u00a0He stayed in Syracuse.\nLater, she found out her husband had fallen in love with another woman.\nOn the last day anyone saw her alive, Carleen began dropping hints that something was amiss. She called Cheryl\u2019s house looking for her two other sisters.\n\u201cShe asked me how my husband and the kids were doing but I sort of rushed her off the phone,\u201d Cheryl said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t getting along at that point. My big sister could be so loving, but there was also a lot of anger there, too. I regret that that was our last conversation. It haunted me for a long time.\u201d\nWhen Cheryl got the call that her sister was missing, she says she could feel something terrible in the pit of her stomach.\n\u201cI think I knew then that Carleen\u00a0was gone,\u201d she said.\nWhen the police finally recovered Carleen\u2019s remains, her husband broke down.\n\u201cI remember he was crying and he said, \u2018If I could just get her back, I would fix everything, I would make everything better\u2019,\u201d Cheryl said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I really began to feel empathy for him. It was his loss too. He suffered too. There was a good man in there somewhere.\u201d\n***\n\n\n\nCheryl McDonald left a heart-shaped wreath on her sister Carleen\u2019s grave. She hopes one day to buy her a tombstone.\n\nVincenzo D'Alto /  \n\nMontreal Gazette\n\n\n\nThey buried Carleen on a hill at the confluence of three nations.\nShe was laid to rest in Akwesasne, on a plot of land that rolls into the St. Lawrence River. Her grave overlooks a pair of green islands that bulge from the Canadian side of the water.\nTo the Mohawk\u00a0people who lived and died in\u00a0this valley before it was split into countries, states and provinces, it will always be home.\nCheryl clutches a heart-shaped wreath as she walks toward her sister\u2019s grave on a muggy August afternoon. She hangs it upon the wooden cross, leans down and whispers something into the ground.\nIt hasn\u2019t always been easy for Cheryl to come back to this place.\n\u201cI grew up in the Iroquois Longhouse tradition, where, when someone died, you got 10 days to mourn and you stopped crying after that,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I did. I worked on my career, my kids, my marriage. My husband found sobriety and I kept pushing myself forward.\u201d\nThe grief ate away at her over the years.\u00a0She watched as a national tragedy unfolded.\n\u201cI kept hearing stories just like Carleen\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cStories about aboriginal girls and women that disappeared. Of sisters and daughters and mothers who were killed like they were nothing. It took me a long a time to admit to myself that Carleen was part of something a lot bigger.\u201d\nThen, in the spring of 2015, Cheryl had a breakthrough. She left her job at the Assembly of First Nations and, for the first time since Carleen died, she spoke up.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when the healing started,\u201d she said. \u201cI shared Carleen\u2019s story\u00a0during\u00a0a vigil at Cabot Square and there was no looking back.\u201d\nA few months later, Cheryl travelled to Winnipeg with another sister for the Roundtable on Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women and Girls. They began meeting people\u00a0who shared their pain, strangers who were willing to unburden themselves in hopes of finding peace.\nIt was in this safe place that Cheryl learned to cry again.\n\u201cI remember going to the traditional healers and breaking down,\u201d she said. \u201cI shed so many tears it dehydrated me, I fell to my knees, I cried and wailed until there was nothing left inside of me.\u201d\nDelbert Sampson was one of the first healers to work with Cheryl. He credits his spirituality with helping him get sober and move on from the abuse he suffered at residential school.\nTo him, the residential school crisis mirrors the situation with Canada\u2019s missing and murdered indigenous women.\n\u201cI was lost for years, I was an alcoholic into my 40s, I needed something to make me feel whole again,\u201d said Sampson, who hails from the\u00a0Shuswap Nation in British Columbia. \u201cThese families are lost too, a lot of them have carried this pain for an entire lifetime. And a lot of them are finding help from traditional healing, from sharing and listening and expressing themselves. That\u2019s when they can let go and give themselves permission to heal.\u201d\nCarleen\u2019s death cut deep into the McDonald family. It has strained some relationships among the\u00a0surviving siblings and there are some questions about Carleen\u2019s final days that will never be answered.\nThere will always be traces of guilt, feelings of culpability and questions about how, if one or two things had been different, Carleen might still be alive.\nFor years rumours about her death possibly being a homicide persisted and the McDonalds will always wonder if the police and government could have done more to find Carleen.\nCheryl says her sister\u2019s children have grown up to become loving parents and they\u2019re all on their own path toward a better future. She knows Carleen would be proud.\n***\n\n\n\nWhen Cheryl McDonald spoke up for the first time about the suicide of her sister Carleen, \u201cthat\u2019s when the healing started.\u201d She will testify at the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women and Girls.\n\nVincenzo D'Alto /  \n\nMontreal Gazette\n\n\n\nCheryl wipes away a tear and drives out of the graveyard.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to buy her a tombstone soon,\u201d she says, referring to the wooden cross planted above Carleen\u2019s grave. \u201cIt\u2019ll be nice. She deserves it, her kids deserve it.\u201d\nBy the time she parks her truck next to the river, Cheryl\u2019s mood has brightened considerably. She wanders towards the water, where a group of children are swimming under a willow tree.\nShe doesn\u2019t know any of the kids, but Cheryl immediately assumes the role of a fun aunt, warning the children to be careful as they climb the tree but then encouraging them to leap from its branches into the water.\nIn a few hours she\u2019ll attend a play about missing and murdered aboriginal women. One of the actresses will start to tear up as she thanks Cheryl for attending the production. Cheryl will tell her sister\u2019s painful story in front of a packed audience.\nBut for now Cheryl can live in the moment, she seems totally at peace.\n\u201cThings get better, there is healing,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a time where I didn\u2019t think that was possible.\u201d\nRELATED\nRead more about aboriginal social issues\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor breaking news stories throughout the day, visit montrealgazette.com\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It is already $13.8 million more expensive than the government originally anticipated. The federal government had originally budgeted $40 million for the inquiry over the next two years. The federal government disclosed Wednesday the commission will need more money to fulfil its mandate. Some critics say they fear the final price tag could end up being even higher than $53.8 million.2. The government will be flexible on the timeline. Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett has stressed the need for the inquiry to be done properly, meaning the federal government is open to the possibility that the commissioners need more than two years to finish their work. Aside from providing the necessary funds and timing, the federal government is to remain at arm's length during the process.3. It will be up to indigenous leaders to comply with commissioners. During a news conference on Wednesday, Bennett said it will be up to indigenous leaders to work in co-operation with commissioners as they go about their research. Some women, such as Ojibway activist Joan Jack from Manitoba, say they are concerned about violence experienced among indigenous women in communities. One question lingers: to what extent will commissioners be able to work inside communities to explore what is going on? Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde said he is confident chiefs will work in partnership with the commissioners. The body will also have to examine violence in urban centres as well.4. Money has been earmarked for victims services and for family liaison services. The federal government announced funding Wednesday of $16.2 million over the next four years for victims' services and to create liaison units to assist families. The measures are designed to ensure families of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls feel connected to the inquiry process as it proceeds.5. The commissioners will release non-legally binding recommendations at the end of the inquiry. At the end of the inquiry, the commissioners are expected to release recommendations for governments \u2014 provincial, territorial and federal. While they will be able to compel witnesses during their work, as stipulated in the Inquiries Act, they will not be able to force governments to comply with their findings. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission released 94 calls to action last year and various levels of government are working on implementing those recommendations.\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Times Colonist\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail to a Friend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Email Address: *\n\n\nYour Name: *\n\n\nTo Email Address: *\n\n\nMessage: *\n\n\n\n* Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext\nDozens move into housing for tent-city homeless\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCapital Home Summer\n\nThe Water Edition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n2016 Festival preview\n\nCheck our listing of the top festivals of summer 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\nTop News\nTop Business\nTop Sports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDozens move into housing for tent-city homeless\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those on medical EI, benefits can run out too soon\n\n\n\n\nFundraiser launched for Victoria dad paralyzed from neck down\n\n\n\n\nNo charges in death of man on Songhees reserve\n\n\n\n\nPolice looking for witnesses after man struck by vehicle in Courtenay\n\n\n\n\nDriver crashes into Quiznos after foot gets caught\n\n\n\n\nAs tent city breakup approaches, not everyone eager to move on\n\n\n\n\nTillicum Lowe\u2019s to hold hiring fair;

Laakkuluk Williamson Bathory is encouraging people to bring Inuit women\u2019s symbols as a sign of support and pride for Indigenous women. (PHOTO BY JANE GEORGE)\n Iqalungmiut are planning an April 2 rally to demand justice for Cindy Gladue, a Cree woman who died in 2011, and a national inquiry into missing and murdered Aboriginal women.\nGladue, a sex worker, was found dead in the bathtub of an Edmonton hotel room in June 2011 where she had bled to death from a severe wound in her vagina.\nThe man who stood trial for her murder, Bradley Barton, was acquitted March 18. His lawyers argued the wound was caused by consensual rough sex.\nBut that verdict has prompted calls for an appeal and sparked anger among many Canadians and Aboriginal groups \u2014 particularly those calling for a national inquiry into cases of murdered and missing Indigenous women across the country.\nIqaluit\u2019s Lakkuluk Williamson Bathory has helped to coordinate a rally that starts at noon April 2. Iqalungmiut are invited to attend to show their support for Cindy Gladue, while asking the federal government to launch a national inquiry into cases like hers. \nWilliamson Bathory encouraged people to bring Inuit women\u2019s symbols and a sign of support and pride for Indigenous women.\nGladue\u2019s case has hit a nerve with many people in the community, Williamson Bathory said, given how long the case went on, how Gladue\u2019s body parts were used as evidence in the court room, and how her accused killer walked free.\n\u201cWhat kind of message does that send?\u201d Williamson Bathory said.\u00a0 \n\u201cIt\u2019s important for people in Nunavut to show solidarity with Indigenous women, and to show respect for Cindy Gladue and her family.\u201d\nIt\u2019s equally important that the rally send a message to Nunavut\u2019s leadership that it has a role to play in finding justice for women who have been abused, she added \u2014 through the support for a national inquiry.\n\u201cWe live in an environment where there is so much violence and suicide,\u201d Williamson Bathory said. \u201cAny initiative that shows an openness to promoting safety, respect and diversity is important.\u201d\nDuring the last sitting of the legislative assembly, the Nunavut government made clear that it would rather fund family support or healing activities than see an inquiry.\n\u201cWith respect to the national inquest or inquiry, it will cost an exorbitant amount to hold that inquest [sic] and we are looking at ways to resolve our social issues through other avenues,\u201d said Jeannie Ugyuk, the minister responsible for the status of women, March 2.\nA report prepared by the RCMP in 2014 revealed that at least 1,181 Indigenous women were murdered and missing in Canada between 1980 and 2012.\nThe RCMP is now preparing to release an updated version of that report this spring.\nAt a closed door meeting with Aboriginal leaders in Calgary last month, federal Aboriginal affairs minister Bernard Valcourt is reported to have said that the new report shows that up to 70 per cent of the murdered and missing women issue \u201cstems from their own communities.\u201d\nValcourt\u2019s office said Apr. 1 that it won\u2019t disclose specifics of the closed door meeting, but that it \u201cencourages the RCMP to release this information.\u201d\nBut Valcourt\u2019s comment has garnered criticism from many Aboriginal groups who question whether the government intends to use that statistic to absolve itself of responsibility.\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what the inquiry is supposed to do \u2014 find out what\u2019s happening to these women,\u201d Williamson Bathory said. \u201cSomething terrible is happening. Regardless of who is perpetrating it, we need to find out why.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(4) Comments:\n#1.\u00a0Posted by  Juss Sayin' on April 02, 2015\n\nYou would think MLA Jeannie Ugyuk would step up to the plate and support the women in Canada. But NO\u2026..

File photo by The Canadian Press/Stephen MacGillivray \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious story \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndigenous leaders in New Brunswick say they are losing faith in Premier Blaine Higgs and his provincial government after a second meeting failed to produce an agreement for an inquiry into systemic racism and two recent police shootings.Wolastoqey and Mi'kmaq chiefs joined Higgs and members of his cabinet Thursday afternoon for a two-and-a-half-hour meeting in Fredericton.The Indigenous leaders said they insisted the provincial government establish an inquiry to look at how the justice system in New Brunswick is failing Indigenous peoples. They left empty-handed and without any commitment on another meeting.\"His inaction is unacceptable,\" said Chief Ross Perley of the Tobique First Nation at a news conference following the talks. \"We have waited over three weeks for this meeting and we still have no firm commitment for an inquiry.\"The last time the two sides met was in June. The chiefs left that meeting disappointed after Premier Higgs turned down their request for an inquiry and instead suggested a task force to review recommendations made from previous inquiries. What people are reading       School\u2019s back in Ontario, and COVID-19 cases keep rising   Young Canadians eye basic income, climate action in throne speech   'Provinces are not independent states': B.C. defends carbon pricing at Supreme Court      Chief George Ginnish, of Eel Ground First Nation, said there has long been systemic racism in the justice system, and when it comes to policing, the RCMP is not prepared to deal with First Nations' issues.\"We need community peacekeeping,\" Ginnish said Thursday. \"We need people that can interact with our members on the ground and work with our mental health teams, work with our health centres, and have a comprehensive approach to what our issues are.\"The chiefs say they're united in their call for a independent provincial inquiry.Higgs, however, told reporters after the meeting he thought the concerns of the Indigenous leaders should be addressed with a national inquiry.\"I said this is bigger than New Brunswick,\" Higgs said. \"This is a national issue. Every province is dealing with these issues, and why don't we make it that?\"The premier said problems involving policing by the RCMP require a national perspective. \"I just believe that we have to make it a bigger national issue because so much of it is related to the federal government.\"  Indigenous leaders in New Brunswick say they are losing faith in Premier Blaine Higgs and his provincial government after a second meeting failed to produce an agreement for an inquiry into systemic racism and two recent police shootings.      The chiefs say they want Opposition members to call for a vote in the legislature as a way to order an inquiry. But Liberal member Chuck Chiasson says it would be late September at the earliest before they could debate the issue.He said the Liberals already introduced a motion on June 25 calling for an inquiry into systemic bias against Indigenous people in New Brunswick, but the legislature doesn't sit again until September.The chiefs' calls follow the fatal shootings of Chantel Moore and Rodney Levi \u2014 two Indigenous people killed by police in June.Mi'kmaq leaders are also calling for immediate reforms to the justice system, including improved police training and standards and increased Indigenous involvement in police oversight.In a letter to the premier dated July 2, they demanded a change in the approach to law enforcement including the creation of a community-based initiative they are calling Mi'kmaq Peacekeepers.\"This will be a system of unarmed safety officers from our communities, trained in de-escalation tactics and to address issues of mental health, addiction, poverty and trauma,\" they wrote. Levi, 48, was attending a barbecue on June 12 near the Metepenagiag Mi'kmaq Nation when someone allegedly called police to complain about an \"unwanted person.\"The Mounties have said a suspect carrying knives was jolted with a stun gun, but that failed to subdue him. He was shot when he charged at officers, police said.Moore, 26, was fatally shot June 4 when an officer from the Edmundston Police Department was conducting a \"wellness check.\" Police allege she lunged at an officer with a knife.Quebec's independent police watchdog agency \u2014 the Bureau des enquetes independantes \u2014 is investigating the killings, because New Brunswick does not have its own police oversight agency.The Mi'kmaq leaders say the results need to be made public, so they can be subject to public scrutiny.This report by The Canadian Press was first published July 9, 2020.

In it, they acknowledged that the judgement required a considerable\nbody of evidence, and that it had not been made before a formal judicial body\nor tribunal. They also wrote that they \u201cdid not intend to fully demonstrate all\nthe elements of a genocidal policy,\u201d because they lacked direct access to all\nthe related evidence.\nHowever, the\ncommission argued that their mandate was to assess the root causes of violence\nagainst Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG). After hearing,\nwatching and listening to testimony at 24 hearings across Canada, they were\nconfident in their decision.\n\u201cLegally\nspeaking, this genocide consists of a composite, wrongful act that triggers the\nresponsibility of the Canadian state under international law,\u201d the legal\nanalysis reads. \u201cCanada has breached its international obligations through a\nseries of actions and omissions taken as a whole, and this breach will persist\nas long as genocidal acts continue to occur and destructive polices are\nmaintained.\u201d\nAlthough Buller\nand the commission didn\u2019t hesitate to call the tragedy genocide, Prime Minster\nJustin Trudeau did.\nCalls for him to\nuse the word could be heard while he gave his remarks to close out Monday\u2019s\nceremony. Trudeau said many people would find this report difficult,\nchallenging and uncomfortable. At that time, however, he declined to use the\nword genocide.\n\u201cWe take this\nday as an essential day in the history and the future of this country, and we\nwill walk forward together,\u201d Trudeau said during the ceremony in Gatineau. \u201cI\nrefuse to let our present and our future mirror our past. To the missing and\nmurder Indigenous women and girls of Canada, to their families, and to\nsurvivors, we have failed you. We will fail you no longer. In the days ahead,\nlet us walk forward together as partners hand in hand as we right these wrongs\nand seek justice for the Indigenous people of Canada.\u201d\nTrudeau reversed\ncourse later in the day when speaking before a women\u2019s conference in Vancouver.\n\u201cWe promised\nCanadians that we would start this process, a process that would ultimately\nchart a path for the future,\u201d he said during his opening remarks at Women\nDeliver 2019. \u201cEarlier this morning, the National Inquiry formally presented\ntheir final report in which they found that the tragic violence that Indigenous\nwomen and girls have experienced amounts to genocide. The strength of the\nfamilies and survivors who bravely shared their truths has shown us the way\nforward. We will do a thorough review of this report and develop and implement\na national action plan to address violence against Indigenous women, girls and\nLGBTQ and two-spirit people.\u201d\nIndigenous women more likely to experience violence and marginalization\nAccording to the\ncommission\u2019s report, Indigenous women and girls are more likely to experience\nrates of overcrowding and homelessness, more likely to experience\ndisproportionately low rates of educational achievement and more likely to\nexperience disproportionately high rates of unemployment.\nThe commission\nwrote that those problems, particularly a lack of housing, forced Indigenous\nwomen and girls into staying in abusive relationships, joining gangs or\nresorting to sex industry work just to meet their basic needs. This is turn\nmade them more vulnerable to violence.\nThe commission\nalso wrote that services and organizations dedicated to helping Indigenous\nwomen and girls were \u201coften plagued by huge gaps in resources and\ninfrastructure,\u201d and were often located in unsafe areas.\nA 2014 RCMP\nreport stated that Indigenous men were responsible for deaths of Indigenous\nwomen in girls in 70 per cent of all cases. However, a forensic document review\ncontained in the report said the oft-cited statistic is not factually sound\nbecause the sample size was too small\n\u201cAs a result of\nthe limitations of the 2014 report dataset, the 70 per cent figure is\nunreliable,\u201d the report reads. \u201c(It) should not be considered as an accurate or\ncomplete statement of the perpetrators of violence against Indigenous women and\ngirls.\u201d\nCreation of National Indigenous and Human Rights Tribunal and National Task Force to re-investigate open files among list of 231 recommendations\nMonday\u2019s report\nincluded 231 Calls for Justice targeting media, law enforcement, education, and\nthe courts, among others. The majority of those calls, however, were directed\nat municipal, provincial, federal and Indigenous governments.\nThe commission\nwrote that changing the structures and systems that led to so many murders,\nassaults and disappearances required deliberate action from all levels of government.\nThose recommendations include creating and implementing a National Action Plan\nfor MMIWG, and conducting an annual review to measure its progress. The\ncommission also called for the creation of a National Indigenous and Human\nRights Tribunal, the hiring of a National and Indigenous Human Rights\nOmbudsperson to receive complaints and evaluate government services, and the\ncreation of an Anti-Racism and Anti-Sexism National Action Plan to end\nstereotypes of Indigenous women and girls.\n\u201cThe evidence makes\nclear that changing the structures and the systems that sustain violence in\ndaily encounters is not only necessary to combat violence, but is an essential\nlegal obligation for all governments in Canada,\u201d the report reads. \u201cWe target\nmany of our Calls for Justice at government for this reason.\u201d\nThe commission also\nmade 37 recommendations for police departments, courts, law societies and bar\nassociations.\nThe primary\ntarget was the Gladue principle, a practice based on a 1999 Supreme Court\nruling that said judges should take an Indigenous offender\u2019s background into\nconsideration before sentencing. The goal was to create a more restorative\njustice approach to help reduce the over-representation of Indigenous people in\nCanadian jails.\nHowever, the\ncommission called for more research into the Gladue principle, and the relevant\nsections of the criminal code it\u2019s based on, to determine how it relates to\nviolence against women and girls.\n\u201cIn any event,\nsentencing, as it is currently carried out, is not resulting in creating safer\ncommunities or reducing the rates of violence against Indigenous women, girls\nand 2SLGBTQQIA people,\u201d the report reads.\nThe\nlimited-duration posting policy was another target. It\u2019s used by the RCMP to govern\nhow long officers can be posted in remote communities. The commission wants\npolice services across the country to end the policy and create a new one with\nmore focus on building and sustaining long-term community relationships.\nThe report also\ncalls for police departments to improve their communication protocols when it\ncomes to dealing with families of missing or murdered Indigenous women, girls\nand 2SLGBTQQIA people, and calls for the creation of a National Task Force to\nreinvestigate all unsolved files involving missing and murdered Indigenous\nwomen, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA people.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nGoogle+\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n Previous articleDucks stolen days before annual Memorial Gardens releaseNext articleNational inquiry\u2019s report welcomed by local activists Jason KerrJason Kerr is a reporter with the Prince Albert Daily Herald.

They agreed to meet again before the end of 2016.\nPolice have been accused of lackluster investigations into the murders and disappearances because the victims are aboriginal and the stereotypes of aboriginals being drunks and prostitutes persists in some minds.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the systemic racism,\u201d Marion Horne, vice-president of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, said after the conference. She said the lack of a national inquiry into 1,200 missing and murdered women is unconscionable.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong in our society \u2026 we do nothing about it,\u201d Horne said during a live interview. \u201cWhy are our women going missing and murdered?\u201d\nAt a parallel meeting taking place nearby, other victims\u2019 families and native leaders gathered and some shouted \u201cShame on Canada.\u201d\nC.J. Julian, whose sister was one of serial killer Robert Pickton\u2019s approximately 50 aboriginal victims a decade ago, said the treatment of aboriginals as second-class citizens has to change.\n\u201cThis is a life and death matter, and it has to stop,\u201d she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as she pleaded for aboriginal women to be treated as equals. \u201cI am not a drunk. I\u2019m not a squaw \u2026 I belong to the Beaver Clan. My Indian name is Shining Eagle Woman. That\u2019s who I am.\u201d\nThe pressure to do something led the government to introduce a five-year action plan last September, but the focus is on ending family violence.\nBellegarde said the $25 million pledged to the program was not enough.\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police said aboriginal women account for 16 percent of all female homicides and 11.3 percent of missing women, yet they make up only about 4.3 percent of the population.\nNew Democratic leader Thomas Mulcair accused the government of refusing the call for a national inquiry because the women are Indian.\n\u201cRacism is involved,\u201d he said.\nHorne agreed with Mulcair.\n\u201cAbsolutely, it\u2019s racist,\u201d she said. As for Harper\u2019s refusal of a national inquiry, she said the prime minister \u201cis evading the problem.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nRelated\nCanada\naboriginal\n\n\n\tLegal Notice: Copyright, trade marks and other intellectual property rights in this website can not be reproduced without the prior permission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweetle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\n\n\nAdd Your Comment\n\n\n America-Canada News\n\n\n\nUS bill would make social media report 'terrorist activity'The US Senate has approved a new measure which would force social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to report content that is believed to be connected to \u201cterrorist activity\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nGuinea ex-junta leader indicted over stadium caseGuinea's ex-junta leader was indicted Wednesday for the deaths of more than 157 people gathered at an opposition rally in 2009, his lawyer said.\n\n\n\n\nS.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward000000VANCOUVER  \u2013  It wasn\u2019t until Canada\u2019s first aboriginal justice minister took the stage to outline a national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women that the tears began to stream down Lorelei Williams\u2019 face and she let herself believe that this time things might be different.\nWilliams, whose aunt disappeared nearly four decades ago and whose cousin\u2019s DNA was discovered on the farm of serial killer Robert Pickton, said Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould\u2019s involvement makes a world of difference.\n\u201cI have issues trusting the government. When (Indigenous Affairs) Minister Carolyn Bennett was speaking, and Minister (of Status of Women) Patty Hajdu, I was having trouble believing them,\u201d Williams said on Wednesday, hours after the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference were announced.\n\u201cBut when Minister Wilson-Raybould came up, then I was like, \u2018OK, there\u2019s actually hope here. One of our women is up there and I really, truly believe she is going to do something.'\u201d\nWilliams\u2019 and Wilson-Raybould\u2019s home province of British Columbia has been especially hard hit by disappearances and murders of indigenous women, from Pickton\u2019s notorious killing spree to the Highway of Tears, where women have vanished.\nProvincially focused inquiries have been conducted and recommendations made, but the lack of follow-through has left many profoundly skeptical about the prospect of real change.\nIn the aftermath of the Pickton\u2019s conviction, former attorney general Wally Oppal was tasked with conducting an inquiry into missing and murdered women in the province.\nThe report, entitled \u201cThe Forsaken,\u201d was criticized for failing to allow families to play a bigger role in the process.\nWilliams said that, while optimistic, she\u2019s concerned the newly announced inquiry will focus on systemic issues without fixing them, and urged the government to develop a plan to implement the findings, along with more than 700 recommendations already generated from other reports.\nA coalition of British Columbia families and support groups said there\u2019s no room for mistakes this time around.\nMary Teegee, with Carrier Sekani Family Services, said the federal government\u2019s decision to call the inquiry finally acknowledges there is a problem.\n\u201c(The fact) that nothing has been done for all these years, that is a mark of racism  \u2013  that people could overlook thousands of missing and murdered Indian women and it wasn\u2019t a national crisis until just recently,\u201d she told a news conference Wednesday in Vancouver.\n\u201cThis is not an indigenous problem. It\u2019s not a women\u2019s problem. It\u2019s a Canadian problem that we need to work together to deal with,\u201d she added, describing the inquiry as a good first step.\nTeegee expressed optimism about what she called a \u201cspirit of reconciliation\u201d conveyed by the federal Liberal government, but added that inquiries are worthless without the resources to ensure recommendations can be followed up on.\n\u201cWe know that many reports sit on a shelf gathering dust. We want to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s too important to get it wrong.\u201d\nKeira Smith-Tague of Vancouver Rape Relief and Women\u2019s Shelter said her organization is concerned about the absence of any explicit reference to how policing will be reviewed.\n\u201cSaying the police are involved or co-operative is not enough and this is not the time to be vague,\u201d Smith-Tague said.\n\u201cWe need \u2026 a process to hold police accountable for their failures to protect indigenous women and girls from male violence.\u201d\nIt would be a joke and an insult to refer women with concerns over how missing-person reports were handled back to the same police forces that failed them in the beginning, she added.\nThe inquiry is scheduled to begin on Sept. 1 and operate at arms length from government. It\u2019s expected to last at least two years and cost at least $53.8 million, nearly $14 million more than originally envisioned.\n \u2013  Follow @gwomand on Twitter\n000000\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n\n Facebook\n Twitter\n YouTube\n\n\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nSubscription Services\nArchive\n \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nThe Lethbridge Herald\nOther Publications\nFood For Thought\n Contact\nCareers\n \n\n\nContact the Lethbridge Herald\n\n504 - 7th Street South\n\t\t\t\t\tLethbridge, AB T1J 3Z7\n[P] (403) 328-4411\n[F] (403)328-4536\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrint Advertising: (403) 328-4410\n\t\t\t\t\tNational Advertising: (403) 380-7585\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Advertising: (403) 380-7585\n\t\t\t\t\tClassifieds: (403) 328-4433\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2016 The Lethbridge Herald, A Division of Continental Newspapers Canada Ltd.\nAdvertising\nTerms and Conditions & Privacy Policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The hearing is the first of two to delve into how systemic issues can contribute to the vulnerability of Indigenous womenA paper bag used to collect the tears of those testifying, to then be burned in a sacred fire, is seen at the final day of hearings at the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, in Richmond, B.C., on April 8. The inquiry is holding another hearing in Calgary on Monday to discuss government services.\u00a0\u00a0(DARRYL DYCK / THE CANADIAN PRESS file photo)Mental-health care and housing are scheduled to be discussed later in the week. A session on policing is to take place in Regina next month.\u201cThis is going to provide us with a foundation for our recommendations ultimately and our final report,\u201d inquiry chief commissioner Marion Buller said.Leanne Gardiner with the Northwest Territories Justice Department told the hearing the biggest challenge is building trust with victims and their families. When there is only one victims services provider in a community, staff turnover can be disruptive.Article Continued Below\u201cAt some points, it has to start from scratch,\u201d she said.Read more: B.C. inquest jury makes 10 recommendations after 2016 death of Saskatchewan womanAdvocate for Vancouver women calls for end to violence in final MMIW public hearingSome people in remote areas have no way to quickly get face-to-face services, Gardiner said.\u201cThe reality is that we don\u2019t have victims services providers in every single community, in person ready to support someone. And crime and victimization happens in every single community.\u201dThe Northwest Territories has 11 victims services providers who work through eight community organizations. Gardiner said those providers have been creative helping people by phone or teleconference, but she said that in person interaction is always preferable.Article Continued BelowPoor weather and spotty internet connections can also pose a challenge, she added.\u201cAs northerners are apt to do, you adjust to the circumstances that you\u2019re in.\u201dJohn Phelps, Yukon\u2019s chief federal prosecutor, said his office deals with a hefty caseload.\u201cWe deal with a significant percentage of violent and sexualized violent crime within the territories compared to the national averages,\u201d he said.Crown witness co-ordinators have made things run more smoothly by helping victims navigate the justice system and by acting as a liaison with lawyers and judges, Phelps said.But not enough co-ordinators are Indigenous, given how many people from those communities are victims of crime, he said. All of the Crown witness co-ordinators in Nunavut are Indigenous, but in the Northwest Territories only one of seven is. In Yukon, it\u2019s one of five.Keeping in contact with victims has also been a challenge.\u201cEither we don\u2019t have adequate information coming from the investigative agency or, because of the lapse in time, victims have moved on.\u201dNorthern prosecution offices also have a tough time recruiting and retaining staff, he added.The inquiry has already heard from 1,200 people across the country whose loved ones have been killed or have disappeared.\u201cFamilies and survivors have told us about a lack of information coming from service providers and families have also told us about lack of timely response,\u201d said Buller, who added that a lack of cultural understanding is also a problem.\u201cFamilies and survivors have told us time and time again that there weren\u2019t translators available, that elders weren\u2019t consulted, that there was also a lack of understanding that in some communities women certainly cannot talk about domestic violence, for example.\u201dRead more about: CalgaryTOP STORIES, DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX.NEW NEWSLETTERHEADLINESSIGN UPMore from The Star & PartnersLOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Otherwise it will produce just one more report on the tragic issue to gather dust on a shelf. Judge Marion Buller speaks to media after being announced as the chief commissioner of the inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women at the Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec on Wednesday.\u00a0\u00a0(Justin Tang / THE CANADIAN PRESS)\u00a0\u00a0Wed., Aug. 3, 2016Two years ago this month the body of a petite and pretty 15-year-old girl, Tina Fontaine, was found wrapped in plastic and dumped in Winnipeg\u2019s Red River. Her shocking murder might have been ignored in the rest of the country, just one in the RCMP\u2019s tally of more than 1,181 killings and disappearances of aboriginal girls and women since 1980. Yet somehow her tragic death acted as a catalyst, producing a drum beat of demands from across Canada for an inquiry into Canada\u2019s national shame of murdered and missing aboriginal women and girls. On Wednesday, 10 months after Justin Trudeau\u2019s government was sworn in, Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett finally announced the long-overdue inquiry. Now its five commissioners must deliver on a daunting mandate to discover the systemic issues that contribute to violence against aboriginal girls and women, from policing, welfare and childcare practices and government policies to social and economic conditions. And unlike the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which ran two years over its official five-year mandate, they must do so in a timelier manner.So far, it\u2019s promising. The five commissioners, led by the first female First Nations judge appointed in British Columbia, Judge Marion Buller, are all well-respected. And the inquiry has been well funded at $53.8 million, almost $14 million more than was originally promised. Perhaps most importantly to keeping the inquiry on track, commission members must deliver an interim report in a year, and wrap up their hearings in just over two, by Dec. 31, 2018.Article Continued BelowNor will the commissioners have to wrangle with witnesses or other jurisdictions to get co-operation. They have been given the power to compel witnesses, including police officers, to testify. And all the provinces and territories have pledged to co-operate. Though the commissioners cannot order that cold cases be reopened \u2014 something criticized by the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada and other groups \u2014 it can refer them back to police forces for further investigation. That is something that would be difficult for any officers to ignore. In short, the commission holds the promise of finally getting to the bottom of a shameful page in Canada\u2019s history \u2014 if it stays on track. That won\u2019t be easy. Already the three ministers responsible for establishing the inquiry have heard from 2,100 participants and received 4,100 online submissions. And delivering recommendations that will effectively address the issue will not be easy. Indeed, if investigations and words were enough to solve Canada\u2019s problem of murdered and missing aboriginal women, the work of a national inquiry would have been completed by now. It started in 2004 with Amnesty International\u2019s door-thumper of a report on the tragedy, Stolen Sisters, that found \u201cCanadian authorities have failed in their responsibility to protect the rights of indigenous women in Canada.\u201d Then in 2012, British Columbia issued its reports of the Missing Women Commission of Inquiry. That year, too, the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada released its Sisters in Spirit study on the issue, followed by a United Nations report in 2015. What\u2019s clear from all the reports and studies is that there is a systemic problem that must be solved: 16 per cent of all women murdered in Canada between 1980 and 2012 were indigenous, although only 4 per cent of Canadian women are. The inquiry promises to shine a spotlight on this national shame and build a new relationship with Canada\u2019s aboriginal women. But promises and words are not enough. We must see results so timely and compelling that they won\u2019t gather dust on a shelf.Read more about: Justin TrudeauThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star & PartnersLOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a031\u00b0CloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsSuicide Squad writer/director David Ayer explains why it\u2019s good to be bad, and fun, too Making a blockbuster movie out of a ragtag band of DC Comics villains was a tough and dirty job that somebody had to do well, says Suicide Squad writer/director David AyerNewsGTACity HallQueen\u2019s ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion & StyleFood & WineHealth & WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReader's LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot Topics:MMIWRio OlympicsU.S. ElectionPokemon GoBlue JaysGeneration 9/11Panama PapersFresh Air FundWeather BlogFollow us:FacebookTwitterGoogle+InstagramRSSManage NewslettersSite MapAboutContact UsFeedbackthestar.comFeedbackSite MapNewslettersInsurance HotlineNew in HomesStar StoreCorrectionsBehavioural TargetingToday's NewsFlyersCanadaStaysContestsToronto Star Newspaper\u00a0Ltd.AboutAtkinson PrinciplesStatement of PrinciplesGet Home DeliveryMy SubscriptionContact UsContact WebmasterFAQNews ReleasesStar InternshipsCareers @ the StarStar AdvisersStar ePaperStar TouchAdvertise with UsAdvertising TermsMedia KitSpecial FeaturesInitiativesSanta Claus FundFresh Air FundSpeakers BureauClassroom ConnectionToronto Star ArchivesReport on Community Giving\u00a9 Copyright Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd. 1996 - 2016Privacy PolicyTerms and Conditions"

Of those women, 164 were missing and 1,017 murdered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTrudeau said Monday the disappearances and deaths of indigenous women in Canada have too often been treated as a low priority or ignored.\n\nMarion Buller, chief commissioner of the Canadian public inquiry, said people often think of genocide as the Holocaust or the mass killings in Africa and elsewhere.

As an example of government interference, though, he said the inquiry needs to be able to properly investigate allegations of \"illegal and improper\" foster-care apprehensions.\"The national inquiry could use its powers to force government departments to comply with investigations into these allegations. The perpetrators could be identified so that governments could stop the misuse of billions of Canadian tax dollars by a few heartless bureaucrats seeking to advance their careers,\" Breen wrote.\"However, interference by the federal government is undermining this important function of the national inquiry. Canadians deserve to know which provinces and territories perpetuate this unnecessary and harmful spending of billions of tax dollars on foster-care apprehensions.\"Last month, the government turned down a request by inquiry officials for a two-year extension in order to give commissioners until Dec. 31, 2020, to make recommendations and produce findings.Instead, the government agreed to only extend the inquiry's deadline by another six months. That gives commissioners until next April 30 to finish its hearings and submit a final report, instead of the initial deadline of Nov. 1 of this year.Reached late Monday, Breen said the refusal to grant the two-year-extension, along with the funding for it, shows the government isn't serious about the commissioners meeting the inquiry's mandate.\"They're trying to kill the national inquiry in a death by a thousand cuts, and they're trying to pin the failure on the commissioners,\" Breen said in a phone interview from Vancouver.Carolyn Bennett, minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, explained the decision to extend the mandate by just six months was made in part because provinces and territories were not unanimously supportive of extending the terms of reference for the inquiry into next year.Gros-Louis, meanwhile, said the inquiry remains independent and impartial.\"With diverse backgrounds, experience and expertise, we are united by a deep commitment to honour the missing and murdered, uncover the truth and build a better future for Indigenous women and girls,\" she wrote.\u2014 by Rob Drinkwater in Edmonton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nNational\n \nSocial\n \nPolitics\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nPost a comment as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmoticons \n\n\n[smile]\n[beam]\n[wink]\n[sad]\n[cool]\n[innocent]\n[rolleyes]\n[whistling]\n[lol]\n[huh]\n[tongue]\n[love]\n[sleeping]\n[yawn]\n[unsure]\n[angry]\n[blink]\n[crying]\n[ohmy]\n[scared]\n[sleep]\n[sneaky]\n[tongue_smile]\n[thumbdown]\n[thumbup]\n[censored]\n[happybirthday]\n[ban]\n[spam]\n[offtopic]\n[batman]\n[ninja]\n[pirate]\n[alien]\n\n\n\nComment Text\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\nPost comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nReport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\nReport Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nWatch this discussion.\nStop watching this discussion.\n\n\n\n\nWatch this discussion\n\n\n\n\n                            Get an email notification whenever someone contributes to the discussion\n                        \n\n                            Notifications from this discussion will be disabled.\n                        \n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\n\nStart watching\nStop watching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (0) comments \n                            \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the discussion.\n\n\nLog In\n\n\n\nKeep it Clean.

The local group includes more than 70 women who are committed to the advancement of women's equality.\nTheir motto is \u201cThe Power of Women Working Together\u201d.\nThe vigil will take place at noon at the Coulter Parkette in Port Elgin.\nIn October, 2016, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) released a report on family violence which included the following statistics:\n\u201cPolice reports showed that there were over 85,000 victims of family violence in Canada (2014 - most recent data). When dating violence is included, this number increases to 133,920 victims. About 96,000 of these victims were women and almost 20,000 were under the age of 20 years.\u201d\nIn September, 2016, the federal inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW) acknowledged that between 1,200 and 4,000 indigenous women are missing or have been murdered since 2000.\nRepresentatives from First Nations will take part in the local vigil, including Jaylynn Wolfe, an eight-year-old girl with a First Nation background, who, when she heard about the number of murdered and missing indigenous woman in Canada, told her mother, \u201cI don't want to be native and I don't want to be  a girl.\u201d\nHer mother Laura Wolfe has turned those remarks into a call not to allow this to continue in Canada.\nIn the past few months, there have been numerous reports of sexual assaults on women by male celebrities, and we have seen misogyny become a political tool in the recent US election.\nGender-based violence continues to be one of the most troubling social issues faced in society today.\nThe United Nations, through the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women, and the World Health Organization state that violence against women is a major global public health problem and human rights violation, and the key risk factor is gender - because women are women.\nCFUW asks that you to show with your presence that we stand with women and girls who are still experiencing violence today and that with your presence you are saying to this community that violence against women will not be tolerated.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Businesses\n\n\n Contact us to Advertise \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRetail\n\n\nBecker Shoes\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFootwear\n\n\nBecker Shoes\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFootwear\n\n\nBecker Shoes\n\n\n\n\nGo to the Marketplace \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Businesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertise with us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContribute\n\n\nSend Your Scoop!\n\nShare your story, photo or video about something you've seen.\n Send your story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart your day with Shoreline Beacon\nChoose among a variety of subscription packages and stay up to date with convenient home delivery and our on the go digital e-edition.\n View my options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-Editions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPort Elgin\n View, submit, participate!\n\n\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nAdvertise online\n\n\nAnnounce your business\n\n\nReach potential customers\n\n\n\n\nContribute\n\n Send us news, photos or videos\n\n Add an event to the calendar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Shoreline Beacon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\nLocal\nCanada\nWorld\n\n\nSports\nHigh School Sports\nHockey\nOther Sports\nPlayoff Pool\n\n\nEntertainment\nLocal\nMovies\nCelebrities\n\n\nOpinion\nEditorial\nLetters\nColumn\n\n\nUR\nEntertainment\nLife\nMoney\nNews\nOpinion\nSports\n\n\n\nLife\nMoney\nMarketplace\nPhotos\nVideos\nEvents\nPolls\nWeather\nBecome A Carrier\nPlayoff Pool\n\n\n\n\n\n Subscribe\n\n Print\n\nE-Edition\n\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nOnline\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nShoreline Beacon\n Feedback\n\n Letters to the editor\n\nPostmedia Publications\n Where to buy\n\n\n\n\nServices\n\nAutos\nCanoe\nCareers\nClassifieds\nHomes\nObituaries\n\n\n\n\n\n Sitemap\n\nPrivacy\nTerms\n Research\n\n Contact-us\n\n\n\n\u00a9  2016 Shoreline Beacon.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Andrew Vaughan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOTTAWA - The federal government is expected to announce Wednesday the terms of an inquiry examining the cases of missing and murdered indigenous women.Here are five things to know about the process:1. Indigenous organizations have been calling for an inquiry: Groups, including the Native Women's Association of Canada and the Assembly of First Nations, have for years urged the federal government to open a national public inquiry into the phenomenon of missing and murdered indigenous women. They will closely examine the terms of reference and the commissioners selected. There are five people expected to sit on the body.In May 2014, the RCMP released a report documenting 1,181 murdered and missing women between 1980 and 2012. A year later, it said 32 aboriginal women had been murdered and 11 more disappeared since it first reported on the issue.2. The Liberal government plans to be flexible on timeline and funding: The federal government has banked on spending $40 million over the next two years on the inquiry but some observers already wonder if this will be enough money and time for the commissioners to do their work. Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett has noted this is a \"placeholder\" budget and she has consistently stressed the need to get the inquiry right.3. The previous government did not support an inquiry: Former prime minister Stephen Harper opposed a formal examination of the issue of murdered and missing indigenous women. He noted there were already a number of studies on the record and stressed the need for action.4. The commission will be able to compel witnesses to testify: Under the Inquiries Act, the commissioners will have the same powers as any court in a civil case to enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give evidence. They may also examine all papers, documents, vouchers, records and books belonging a public office or institution.5. Child welfare is expected to be a central theme of the study: Bennett says child welfare will be a key issue. She said the government has repeatedly heard about the \"devastating\" impact on children who are apprehended and what often happens to their mothers.The government is currently engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal over federal funding for child welfare services on reserve.In January, the tribunal ruled the federal government discriminated against First Nations children in its funding of child welfare services.\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2016 Humboldt Journal\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail to a Friend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Email Address: *\n\n\nYour Name: *\n\n\nTo Email Address: *\n\n\nMessage: *\n\n\n\n* Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext\nCalico invites donors for building preview\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Brother, Big Sister POLL\nBig Brothers, Big Sister Humboldt is looking for more mentors for their 2016 crew.

Maisy disappeared in September 2008. She was 16.\u00a0\u00a0(Blair Gable / for the toronto star)\u00a0\u00a0By Tanya TalagaStaff ReporterTues., May 30, 2017Mom Laurie Odjick spent Tuesday busy with her daughter Madison while more than 5,400 km away, the national inquiry on murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls began family hearings.As Odjick went about her daily business, on this historic day in Whitehorse, Chief Commissioner Marion Buller stood in a big white tent in a parking lot, and she spoke to those who gathered or watched live online, as she compelled families and survivors to trust them with their stories.\u201cAll of Canada needs to hear the truth about the violence indigenous women and girls have endured for generations and continue to endure. Why? This is a sorrowful and essential part of our national history,\u201d Buller said as she read her notes from a black music stand that served as a podium. \u201cWhen an Indigenous woman or girl goes missing, is murdered or is harmed, we are all weaker, as families, as communities, as a nation. We have lost a life-giver.\u201dOdjick lives in Maniwaki, Que. with her beautiful family. Happy photographs of time spent on the water or with her smiling children fill her Facebook page, but her feed is also tinged with sadness, strength and searing pain. This is part of her Feb. 7 post on the problems with the inquiry.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the slow start of the inquiry that was frustrating. It was the lack of communication to Our FAMILIES that was frustrating. Calling us impatient (That is wrong)! Do not put that on US (That is wrong)!\u201dArticle Continued BelowOdjick\u2019s first born daughter Maisy, was 16 when she disappeared without a trace in September 2008 along with her best friend Shannon Alexander, 17, from the Kitigan Zibi-Anishinabeg First Nation and Maniwaki area, north of Ottawa. The girls disappeared leaving their purses, wallets and identification behind. From the start, Odjick said the girls\u2019 cases were bungled. Two different police forces, the Kitigan Zibi and the Surete du Quebec, investigated their disappearance because Maisy lived on reserve and Shannon lived just outside. But they were treated as runaways, and nothing seemed to progress or get done.When I was a political reporter, I first wrote about Maisy and Shannon on Jan. 6, 2012 just after the United Nations Office for the High Commissioner on Human Rights signaled they were putting Canada on notice for its treatment of the then estimated 600 murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls in Canada.More than five years ago, Odjick told me how her daughter\u2019s vanishing was treated by police. Their families weren\u2019t listened to. Police dismissed their concerns. It would be a complaint I would hear over and over again. \u201cI was never interviewed by police,\u201d Odjick said. \u201cI was never asked to take a lie-detector test. Nothing happened. Nothing was done right for my daughter.\u201dOdjick was an early campaigner to bring justice to all families of the stolen sisters. She sits on the national family advisory committee (NFAC.) So, on this day of firsts, I reached out to Odjick to ask for her thoughts because an inquiry would not have happened in this country without pioneers like Odjick, who fought for one for years.She said she will \u201calways be on the fence\u201d about it. \u201cI do hope that families get what they need and want out of this inquiry. I am in full support of the families that want this,\u201d she said.\u201cThe commissioners started off on the wrong foot and they need guidance, and I hope we, as a committee, can help them and that they hear us. Time will tell. The commissioners heard Maisy\u2019s story when we had our first NFAC gathering in Toronto. So I believe I have participated,\u201d she said, adding she is turning her energies towards making sure the families in Quebec also get a chance to be heard. \u201cI am going to make sure that we families in Quebec get a hearing.\u201dDelivered dailyThe Morning Headlines\u00a0NewsletterSubscribeThe Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E\u00a01E6.

(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP)\n            \n\nTORONTO (AP) \u2014 The head of the Organization of American States said Tuesday he would like to create a panel of experts to investigate the disappearances and deaths of indigenous women in Canada, a problem that a Canadian report this week described as \u201cgenocide.\u201d\nOAS Secretary General Luis Almagro made the offer in a letter to Canada\u2019s foreign minister and tweeted that it is necessary to \u201cclarify these allegations and achieve justice.\u201d\n\n\nAlmagro was responding to a Canadian public inquiry report issued Monday that said the problem is so serious it amounts to \u201cgenocide.\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he accepts the finding that it was genocide and plans on coming up with a national action plan.\nA Royal Canadian Mounted Police report before the inquiry was formed reviewed cases from 1980 to 2013 and found 1,181 First Nations women fell into the missing or murdered category \u2014 almost double earlier estimates. Of those women, 164 were missing and 1,017 murdered.\nTrudeau said Monday the disappearances and deaths of indigenous women in Canada have too often been treated as a low priority or ignored.\nMarion Buller, chief commissioner of the Canadian public inquiry, said people often think of genocide as the Holocaust or the mass killings in Africa and elsewhere. She described the Canadian \u201cgenocide\u201d as the death by a million paper cuts for generations.\n\n\nThe inquiry report said police and the justice system need to acknowledge that the historical and current relationship with Indigenous people has been largely defined by \u201ccolonialism, racism, bias, discrimination, and fundamental cultural and societal differences.\u201d\nAlmagro noted Canada\u2019s powerful voice around the world on human rights but said experts from the outside could \u201cclarify the accusation and denunciation of genocide in your country.\u201d\nAdam Austen, a spokesman for Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, said they have received the letter from Almagro and will provide a response in due course.\n\u201cOur government is committed to ending the ongoing national tragedy,\u201d Austen said in an email.\nCopyright \u00a9 The Associated Press.

Most cab drivers demand payment up front from indigenous passengers, if they stop to pick them up at all, she said.Calls for a boycott\n\n\nTraverse has started up a volunteer ride-sharing page for indigenous women and is calling for people to boycott the taxis.\"I'm hoping to hit them in the wallet,'' said Traverse, a 46-year-old artist. \"We make up a good portion of their income and you don't treat customers like garbage.''Racism in WinnipegWinnipeg has spent the past year trying to address race relations after Maclean's magazine dubbed it the most racist city in Canada.Despite a recent race summit, problems persist. A decorated indigenous war veteran says he was recently kicked out of a downtown mall by a security guard. A grand chief complained last month she was profiled and followed around by security in store before approaching the manager.\n\"I'm hoping to hit them in the wallet.''Traverse said she has been forced out of a moving cab by a driver and was assaulted years ago but didn't to press charges. She has resorted to waving money while trying to hail a cab just to get one to stop. She said she is almost always asked to pay for the fare up front.\"They shouldn't paint everybody with the same brush,'' she said.\n\nThe taxi board's responseTaxicab board chair David Sanders said the board has received a few formal complaints and acts quickly to investigate them when they come up. But he said people often wait too long to lodge a complaint or don't show up to a formal hearing, which makes it harder to address.\"As far as we're concerned, everyone should feel safe taking a cab in Winnipeg,'' Sanders said. \"The extent to which they don't means we have more work to do.''The board has reached out to indigenous organizations and will look at providing more cultural training \u2014 including indigenous history and conflict resolution \u2014 to drivers, he said.\n\"As far as we're concerned, everyone should feel safe taking a cab in Winnipeg.''But Grand Chief Sheila North Wilson, who represents northern First Nations, said that's just a start. More indigenous people should be hired by the industry and there should be a greater emphasis on educating all newcomers about First Nations, she said.Racism has become commonplace for indigenous people, North Wilson said. As the number of missing and murdered indigenous women hovers around 1,200, North Wilson said the inability of young women to count on a safe ride home is putting them at risk.\"It puts people who already at vulnerable stages in their lives to be more exposed to the element of racism on our streets,'' said North Wilson, adding the tolerance for racism is running out.\"Marginalized people (are) standing up for themselves and saying enough is enough. We demand respect and deserve respect.''\n\nALSO ON HUFFPOST:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\ue007\n\n\n\t\t\t\t   10 Indigenous Voices That Inspire Us\t\t\t\t  \n\n\n\n\nof\n\n\n\ue000\n\n\n\ue001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce blacklisted by the U.S. government for producing work that could \"encourage widespread citizen protest,\" Saskatchewan-born artist Buffy Sainte-Marie has built a career around songs of love and dissent. Her \"Universal Soldier\" became a popular anti-war anthem in the '60s, while her love song \"Up Where We Belong\" won an Academy Award for best song after it was featured on the soundtrack for \"An Officer and a Gentleman.\" But she has also been a strong spokesperson for indigenous rights, standing against the Kinzua Dam that had displaced part of New York's Seneca Reservation. \n\n\n\nTa'Kaiya Blaney emerged in 2010 with \"Shallow Waters,\" a heartfelt song that expressed the young artist's concerns about the threats that oil spills pose to oceans. She has since become a prominent voice opposing the Northern Gateway pipeline, which would transport oil from Alberta to B.C.'s coast for shipping to Asian markets.\n\n\n\nAfter the Oka Crisis brought the relationship between Canada and First Nations to national attention, Phil Fontaine became one of the first people to speak out about sexual abuse in the residential school system. He has since become one of the most visible voices advocating on behalf of indigenous people. As national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, he helped negotiate the Indian Residential Schools Settlement, an agreement that established payouts to survivors and a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. \n\n\n\nHaida activist Guujaaw played a key role in the establishment of Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve after protesting logging in the area. He later served as president of the Council of the Haida Nation for 13 years, a role in which he undertook a successful effort to rename B.C.'s Queen Charlotte Islands as \"Haida Gwaii,\" which means \"islands of the people.\"\n\n\n\nThe host of CBC's \"8th Fire\" documentary series has emerged as one of the most prominent voices articulating indigenous issues in Canada. He was a regular fixture on television as Idle No More protests swept across the country in 2012 and he has since raised his intellectual profile with a successful defense of Joseph Boyden's \"The Orenda\" in the Canada Reads literary battle. More recently, he was floated as a possible candidate to succeed Shawn Atleo as national chief of the Assembly of First Nations.\n\n\n\nChief Clarence Louie sees economic development as the way forward for B.C.'s Osoyoos Indian Band. It owns vineyards, a golf course and a desert cultural centre. Though Louie is a controversial figure among some indigenous people, prominent politicians such as Prime Minister Stephen Harper look to him as an \"example of entrepreneurial spirit,\" according to CBC.\n\n\n\nMurray Sinclair has spent decades seeking justice for indigenous people. He became his province's first indigenous justice when he was named associate chief judge of the Provincial Court of Manitoba. He was handed an enormous responsibility when he was named chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2009, a role in which he oversaw testimony from residential school survivors in an effort to educate Canadians about the system's destructive effects on First Nations, Inuit and Metis people.\n\n\n\nNot unlike Buffy Sainte-Marie, Inuk throat singer Tanya Tagaq is out to defeat stereotypes. In 2012, the Toronto International Film Festival commissioned her to do a soundscape for the silent documentary \"Nanook of the North,\" effectively reclaiming a film which she said had a \"bunch of bullshit happy Eskimo stereotypes.\" And that's just one work that makes her an inspiring artist. More recently, she was harassed online by anti-seal hunt activists after posting a \"Sealfie\" with her baby next to a dead seal. She fought back against her tormentors and ended up shutting down one of their Twitter accounts with the help of police. We can't wait to see what she does next.\n\n\n\nThis Inuit activist has dedicated her life to ensuring the health and cultural survival of her people. She partook in negotiations toward the Stockholm Convention, which banned persistent organic pollutants that were contaminating the Arctic. She also made climate change a human rights issue when she filed a petition against the U.S. to the Inter-American Commission, alleging that its refusal to reduce emissions was threatening the Inuit. \n\n\n\nIn 1990, with an eagle feather in his hand, Manitoba MLA Elijah Harper helped scuttle the Meech Lake Accord, saying that First Nations were not consulted in discussions toward constitutional amendments that would have recognized Quebec as a \"distinct society.\" Then-Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells later refused to hold a vote on the accord, and it fell apart.

Peter Leon said they are also ready to participate.\"The OPP will do whatever is asked of the OPP as an investigation,\" said Leon, adding this would include revisiting cases should new information come to light.The RCMP has also offered its full participation and support.The commission falls under the part of the federal Inquiries Act governing public inquiries, which means it will have the power to summon witnesses and compel evidence and testimony, just like a civil court.The provinces and territories have all agreed to sign on to these terms of reference, which include giving commissions jurisdiction over areas such as municipal and provincial policing.Beverley Jacobs, a lawyer and advocate for families, said she likes that the terms of reference are broad.\"I have to have full trust in the commissioners and the knowledge that they have to put some teeth into the terms of reference,\" said Jacobs.Shelagh Day of the Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action said she is concerned it leaves too much up to interpretation.\"One of the things we know is that governments establish inquiries for very good reasons and then when it comes to the close examination of a policy or practice or requests for information or a file that seems sensitive, governments can balk,\" said Day.\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2016 Battlefords News Optimist\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail to a Friend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Email Address: *\n\n\nYour Name: *\n\n\nTo Email Address: *\n\n\nMessage: *\n\n\n\n* Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext\nWater restrictions still in place\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug. 1, 2016 POLL\nIf North Battleford didn't have wells, it would be in as bad a shape as Prince Albert.

(Credit: Fram Dinshaw/video still). \n\n\n\n \n\n\nPrevious story \n\n\n\n\nHer body was found in a dumpster. She was a homeless woman from Manitoba\u2019s Birdtail Sioux First Nation, murdered in Vancouver.\n\n\n\n\nShe was one of 1,200 murdered and missing Indigenous women that are now the subject of a long-awaited federal government inquiry launched on Dec. 8 by Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a long time coming,\u201d said Birdtail Sioux Chief Kenneth Chalmers. He was attending the Assembly of First Nations Special Chiefs Assembly in Gatineau on Dec. 8, where PM Justin Trudeau had earlier made an appearance.\nThe woman found dead in Vancouver was his community\u2019s only confirmed death. Her parents had suffered through residential schools, a legacy that left the family grappling with addiction issues.\nIndeed, the victim herself was affected by Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), a condition caused when a pregnant mother consumes alcohol, he said. FASD can cause birth defects, cognitive, emotional, and behavioural problems, and physical disabilities.\nVideo of Chief Kenneth Chalmers shares his experience dealing with murdered and missing Indigenous women.\nChief Kenneth Chalmers speaks with National Observer.\n\u201cWe have to do a lot more on our part to make sure our young women and our young girls are warned of the pitfalls of what could happen to them out there if they\u2019re not careful. We're trying to teach them to be on guard out there,\u201d said Chalmers, indicating that a federal inquiry alone would not be a magic bullet for Canada\u2019s First Nations.\nFor Chalmers, the solution involves better communication with his community\u2019s youth, and working with families and parents to keep their children in school and off the streets. His nation recently built a new high school, which will likely help improve education outcomes for Birdtail Sioux teens.\nChange was afoot even before Wilson-Raybould and her parliamentary colleagues formally launched the government inquiry into murdered and missing women.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a few women go missing but we\u2019ve always managed to hunt them down. In the last couple of years the RCMP have done a good job in finding them because of the public pressure. They\u2019re starting to do a better job of it, in my opinion,\u201d said Chalmers.\nChange we can believe in?\nTwo provinces west of Manitoba, Cecil Nepoose also held out hope that a federal inquiry would staunch the flow of women and girls disappearing from the Samson Cree Nation.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s really taken notice Only at this point in time that announcement kind of triggered things off. I believe that there is hope that change will happen,\u201d said Nepoose.\nHe said that a number of women had previously gone missing from his community but did not have any precise casualty toll. There had been a recent death in the community, a situation that required the presence of the current chief Kurt Buffalo, he said. \"I\u2019m filling in as a proxy for him,\u201d said Nepoose.\nThe victim was killed in a gang-related homicide near Edmonton, just 90 km north of the Samson Cree Nation\u2019s lands. \nLike his Manitoban counterpart, Nepoose does not think that an inquiry alone will solve the problem of murdered and missing women. Part of the answer lies with the Samson Cree Nation itself, he says, as they have to come up with their own plan to protect women in their community.\n\u201cThere is a lot of work to be done,\u201d said Nepoose.\nPersistent racism\nRacism against First Nations remains entrenched in Canadian communities. Indigenous people in cities such as Thunder Bay face racist abuse in the street, physical assault, and even rape.\nThree years ago, a Thunder Bay woman walking to her local store was abducted by a group of men in a car who drove her outside city limits, before raping her, attempting to strangle her, and leaving her for dead. Her kidnappers explicitly told her that she was being attacked because she was Indigenous and warned her to keep her mouth shut.\nFor those who escape violent assault or attempted murder, institutional racism permeates the life of First Nations people in Canada.\nAccording to a Maclean's article published in January, incarceration rates in First Nations communities run at 1,400 per 100,000 people or 2,207 times Canada\u2019s national average. Unemployment among First Nations people is approximately 14 per cent, twice Canada\u2019s national average. Their median income of $22,344 is just 60 per cent of the national average. \nHomicide rates are 8.8 people per 100,000, 17 times that of Canada as a whole\u2014 and infant mortality runs at 11.7 per 1,000 live births, more than double the national average.\n\n\n\n\nShare this article.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterFacebook Like\n\n\n\nDecember 9th 2015Fram Dinshaw\n\n\n\nPolitics, First Nations, Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women, First Nation rights, News\n\n\n\n\nToday's must read \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the National Observer.

They will travel from coast to coast to hear testimonies.Among the family members in attendance will be Sharon Johnson. Her sister, Sandra Johnson, 18, was found brutally murdered in Thunder Bay. A man walking his dog discovered Johnson, lying on the ice of the frozen Neebing-McIntyre floodway, on Feb. 13, 1992.Laurie Odjick will also be in attendance on Wednesday. Her daughter Maisy, 16, along with her friend Shannon Alexander, 17, have been missing since September 2008, from Maniwaki, Que. The two were supposed to head to a dance and then sleep over at Alexander\u2019s place when they disappeared without a trace.Article Continued Below\u201cI hope the families\u2019 voices were heard,\u201d Odjick said, referring to the goals of the inquiry and how it will be conducted. \u201cI would like to see all recommendations that were made by family members implemented across Canada.\u201d The inquiry will examine systemic issues of violence, including poverty, cultural and historical causes of the vulnerability of indigenous women.Canadians have demanded an inquiry into the more than 1,181 murdered and missing aboriginal women and girls. Former prime minister Stephen Harper refused to hold an inquiry, but current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made earlier vows to hold one if he was elected. Indigenous leaders and families of the lost women want to see solutions to help lift the lives of indigenous women.And they want answers from police forces on how they can better communicate with families. That includes investigating cases faster, and being more transparent and communicative with families.Bennett has said policing will be part of the inquiry.As Ottawa makes its announcement on Wednesday, a Northern Ontario reserve continues its fight for more police help investigating the death of a young mother.Charnelle Masakeyash\u2019s partial remains were found in June in Mishkeegogamang First Nation, 500 kilometres northwest of Thunder Bay. Her remains were scattered near where members of her family live.The 26-year-old mother of three children was last seen walking along Hwy. 599 near Pickle Lake in November.After an extensive, community-led search, Masakeyash\u2019s jaw bone was found in a doghouse, said Melissa Skunk, one of the Mishkeegogamang community members who participated in searches for her remains. Her skull and other bones were later recovered in the same area.Mishkeegogamang Chief Connie Gray-McKay said Ontario Provincial Police investigators are conducting a \u201cdeath investigation.\u201d Gray-McKay said she was told by authorities it is not a homicide probe because it is extremely difficult to tell how Masakeyash died, due to the remains left and the condition they are in. That isn\u2019t good enough for Gray-McKay or Masakeyash\u2019s family. \u201cShe didn\u2019t end up in our backyard without something happening to her. The family knows something happened to her. And so do we,\u201d says Gray-McKay, speaking for the family and nearly 1,100 on-reserve community members.Mishkeegogamang, also known as Mish, has suffered its share of tragedies. Eleven women and men have gone missing or have been murdered since the 1960s.When it was reported that Masakeyash was missing, the community organized search parties and spent months searching in the bush and around Pickle Lake.The OPP confirmed the Masakeyash case is being examined as a death investigation and urge any members of the public who have more information to come forward.\u201cPeople are hurting and need to be supported. In Northern Ontario, we have a lot of murdered and missing indigenous people,\u201d said Gray-McKay.In remote communities, sometimes police are slow to respond to calls for help or have dismissed tips brought to them, said Gray-McKay.\u201cThere has to be something more applied to the police,\u201d she said, adding that missing persons cases need top priority.Mishkeegogamang searchers had the assistance of dive teams, dogs and helicopters because they \u201cmaintained the pressure\u201d on police, she said, adding the community constantly appealed to indigenous and police leaders for help.\u201cI feel for families who aren\u2019t able to do it,\u201d Gray-McKay said.Masakeyash was last seen on Nov. 6, 2015. Gray-McKay and Skunk both actively searched for Masakeyash. Skunk\u2019s aunt, Sarah Skunk, disappeared without a trace in 1995. The 43-year-old frequently travelled from the Thunder Bay area to the West Coast. Sarah came from a large family and they want to know what happened to her. For years, they said they heard nothing from the police on the investigation into her disappearance. Nishnawbe Aski Nation police, a northern indigenous police service, has now taken over her case from the OPP. Nishnawbe Aski Nation Police Sgt. Jackie George told the Star there is nothing new to report.There were no signs of a disturbance where Masakeyash\u2019s remains were found, Melissa Skunk said.\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense. Was she placed there?\u201dIt has been suggested that wolves killed her, Skunk said, but the searchers never found evidence of animal activity. Wolves are frequent visitors on the reserve. The OPP has officially stopped searching for any other body parts.\u201cShe was found 500 metres off the trail. What was she doing in that area?\u201d Skunk asked, adding that Masakeyash was afraid to go into the forest on her own.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police released a report in 2014 that said 1,181 aboriginal women and girls were murdered or missing in Canada.However, indigenous leaders and activists fear the number is much higher. Last year, the Star compiled a list of murdered and missing indigenous women and girls after the RCMP refused to release names and details.The Star discovered that contrary to what the RCMP found in its 2014 report, a high majority of indigenous women and girls did not know their killers.The Star found 44 per cent of women were victims of strangers, acquaintances and serial killers. That was based on a review of 750 murder cases, 224 of which remain unsolved.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star & PartnersLOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a028\u00b0CloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogs30 Canadians to watch at the Rio OlympicsMeet the athletes who will be in the spotlight at the Summer Games from Aug. 5-21 in Brazil.NewsGTACity HallQueen\u2019s ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion & StyleFood & WineHealth & WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReader's LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot Topics:MMIWRio OlympicsU.S. ElectionPokemon GoBlue JaysGeneration 9/11Panama PapersFresh Air FundWeather BlogFollow us:FacebookTwitterGoogle+InstagramRSSManage NewslettersSite MapAboutContact UsFeedbackthestar.comFeedbackSite MapNewslettersInsurance HotlineNew in HomesStar StoreCorrectionsBehavioural TargetingToday's NewsFlyersCanadaStaysContestsToronto Star Newspaper\u00a0Ltd.AboutAtkinson PrinciplesStatement of PrinciplesGet Home DeliveryMy SubscriptionContact UsContact WebmasterFAQNews ReleasesStar InternshipsCareers @ the StarStar AdvisersStar ePaperStar TouchAdvertise with UsAdvertising TermsMedia KitSpecial FeaturesInitiativesSanta Claus FundFresh Air FundSpeakers BureauClassroom ConnectionToronto Star ArchivesReport on Community Giving\u00a9 Copyright Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd. 1996 - 2016Privacy PolicyTerms and Conditions"

Nikki Sullivan/Cape Breton Post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been hidden too long\u2019\n\n\nMEMBERTOU, N.S. \u2014 Eighty-one years after they went missing, Georgina Doucette still becomes overcome with emotion thinking about how her family can\u2019t bury her aunts and uncles.\nThis is what the Eskasoni resident told commissioner Qajaq Robinson during her testimony at the second day of the the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in Membertou.\n\u201cThis morning I had to pray and smudge to get the strength to come here,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSo many years have gone by \u2026 it\u2019s been hidden too long.\u201d\nDoucette was testifying with her cousin, Joe Michael from Shubenacadie, about the disappearance of Noel Marshall, Judina Marshall, Joseph Michael and Kate Michael in 1936. Kate was eight months pregnant.\nThey had gone from Eskasoni to Big Pond by boat, leaving the reserve at 7 a.m. on March 29. The women had Easter baskets to sell by barter while the men went to spear eels.\nTheir boat was found, with holes in it. The four adults were never found.\n\u201cI get my strength from my creator and my people in Eskasoni,\u201d Doucette said, after admitting she had a little breakdown before coming to testify.\n\u201cI would like to know who was responsible for the murder of my aunts and my uncles. And put it all together. And if we are lucky enough \u2026 to bring them home and give them a proper burial.\u201d\nMichael, a retired RCMP officer who spent 28 years in investigations, is the grandson of Joseph and Kate. During his testimony, he talked about how his father never spoke about his parents or their disappearance.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re young it becomes complacent, you don\u2019t know, we only saw our mother\u2019s side of grandparents,\u201d he said.\nAs a child, Michael and his family would visit an older woman who was blind when they went to Eskasoni. At the time, he thought it was to show respect. Later in life he learned that woman was his paternal great-grandmother.\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t kick in until I got involved in this murdered and missing women (inquiry),\u201d said Michael, who started doing his own investigation after being given information from two now-deceased elders, Charlie Morris and Greg Johnston.\n\u201cWe went over 45\u201350 years of documentation that he (Johnston) had ... and also the late Charlie Morris. Both of them had a great dedication to finding out what happened to my grandparents and my aunt and uncle,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe story they told was very interesting. The documents they had was, to me, like a puzzle.\u201d\nThrough these documents and his own investigating, Michael found out that new information was presented to then Chief Terry Francis in 1964. He believes that information could have solved the case.\nMichael said this information included a woman from Whycogomah coming forward to say her husband murdered the four, after a dispute, and buried them in a mass grave. Allegedly, she came forward because she couldn\u2019t deal with the guilt of knowing anymore.\nThis information was brought to the police, according to Michael\u2019s testimony, but nothing was done with it.\n\u201cI\u2019ve often wondered, was it a language problem? Or a \u2018do not want to be bothered by it\u2019 problem,\u201d he said.\nThrough his investigation, Michael said he knows his relatives arrived in Big Pond because someone from that area said they had tea with them.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld\nBy Kristy Kirkup\nTHE CANADIAN PRESS\nGATINEAU, Que.- The chief commissioner of the inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls told survivors and families on Monday they have started to rewrite Canadian history.\nThe tragedy, former B.C. judge Marion Buller said, is a direct result of a \u201cpersistent and deliberate pattern of systemic racial and gendered human- and Indigenous-rights violations and abuses, perpetuated historically and maintained today by the Canadian state, designed to displace Indigenous people from their lands, social structures and governments, and to eradicate their existence as nations, communities, families and individuals.\u201d\n\u201cThis,\u201d she said to a growing chorus of cheers and applause in the grand hall of the Canadian Museum of History across the Ottawa River from Parliament, \u201cis genocide.\u201d\nBuller said she and her three fellow commissioners are holding up a mirror to the country, reflecting what they heard from more than 2,300 people over two years of cross-country public hearings and work to gather evidence.\n\u201cYour truths cannot be unheard,\u201d Buller told hundreds of people gathered in the museum to mark the release of the inquiry report, along with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett and Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O\u2019Regan.\nA complete change is required to dismantle colonialism in Canadian society, said Buller, who is Cree from the Mistawasis First Nation in Saskatchewan.\n\u201cThis paradigm-shift must come from all levels of government and public institutions,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIdeologies and instruments of colonialism, racism and misogyny, both past and present, must be rejected.\u201d\nThe report contains more than 200 recommendations to multiple levels of government. It calls the violence against First Nations, Metis and Inuit women and girls a form of \u201cgenocide\u201d and a crisis \u201ccenturies in the making.\u201d\n\u201cThese abuses and violations have resulted in the denial of safety, security, and human dignity,\u201d the report says.\nIt also has calls for action in areas including justice and health, including that health-service providers develop programs that could help young people recognize the signs of being targeted for exploitation.\nThe report, the culmination of a three-year effort often beset by controversy, delays and personnel problems, documents what Buller calls \u201cimportant truths,\u201d including that Canadian laws and institutions are themselves to blame for violating the human rights of Indigenous Peoples.\n\u201cI hope that knowing these truths will contribute to a better understanding of the real lives of Indigenous people and the violations of their human and Indigenous rights when they were targeted for violence,\u201d Buller writes in the report.\nShe also makes a point to acknowledge potential criticisms.\n\u201cSkeptics will be fearful and will complain that the financial cost of rebuilding is too great, that enough has been done, that enough money has been spent,\u201d Buller writes.\n\u201cTo them I say, we as a nation cannot afford not to rebuild.\nOtherwise, we all knowingly enable the continuation of genocide in our own country.\u201d\nThe steps necessary to \u201cend and redress this genocide\u201d must be no less monumental than the combination of systems and actions that have been used to \u201cmaintain colonial violence for generations,\u201d the commissioners say.\nThe recommendations,\u00a0 framed in the report as \u201ccalls for justice,\u201d include developing an effective response to human trafficking cases and sexual exploitation and violence, including in the sex industry. They are not optional, but constitute legal imperatives, the report says.\nAdditional calls include the need to establish a national Indigenous and human rights ombudsperson and a national Indigenous and human rights tribunal.\nIt also recommends the development of a national action plan to ensure equitable access to employment, housing, education, safety, and health care, as well as long-term funding for education programs and awareness campaigns related to violence prevention.\nThe report also strongly focuses on the need for actors in the justice system and in police services to acknowledge that the historical and current relationship with Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people has been largely defined by \u201ccolonialism, racism, bias, discrimination, and fundamental cultural and societal differences.\u201d\n\u201cWe further call upon all police services and justice system actors to acknowledge that, going forward, this relationship must be based on respect and understanding, and must be led by, and in partnerships with, Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA (two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, asexual) people.\u201d\nMissing and murdered Indigenous women are believed to number in the thousands in Canada, but the report says that despite the commission\u2019s best efforts to quantify the extent of the tragedy, \u201cno one knows an exact number.\u201d\nIn 2005, the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada created a database tracking cases and produced a 2010 report documenting 582 missing and murdered Indigenous women. In 2014, the RCMP released a national overview and pegged the number of cases between 1980 and\u00a02012 at nearly 1,200. Other unverified estimates are far higher.\nResponding to the conclusions is the responsibility not only of federal and provincial governments and law enforcement agencies, but all Canadians in both the immediate and long-term, the report says.\n\u201cIndividuals, institutions, and governments can all play a part\u00a0 \u2026 We encourage you, as you read these recommendations, to understand and, most importantly, to act on yours.\u201d\nRead the full report here:\nFinal Report\n\n\u00a0\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

That's how I feel. They just stomped on her,\" said Janett Poorman, from her Burnaby, B.C. home.\n\n\n\n Poorman's daughter, Angela Poorman, 29, was stabbed to death on Dec. 14, 2014. Her case is one of 230 missing and murdered indigenous women's cases CBC found that remain\u00a0unsolved. Poorman asked Manitoba's Compensation for Victims of Crime program for help and she was denied because of her daughter's past criminal record.\u00a0 Less than a month after her daughter's death, Poorman found out she is on the hook for the $4,500 funeral bill. Poorman submitted an application for the funeral costs under Manitoba's compensation for victims of crime program. That application was rejected and the victims services employee dissuaded the family from filing an appeal saying there was no point in trying. Under the province's Victims' Bill of Rights, family members who have to pay the victim's funeral costs are eligible for up to $5,400.\u00a0 That amount may be reduced if the victim was convicted of an offence in the past five years.\u00a0 \u200bVictim's offences a sign of poverty In Angela's case, she had 10 convictions, the majority of which were\u00a0breaching her conditions of release. Her original convictions were one\u00a0count of driving while impaired and one count of identity theft for\u00a0which she was fined and put on probation. \"The types of offences on her criminal record are those of someone who was experiencing poverty and are not uncommon to people who have a lower socio-ecomonic status in society,\" said Christa Big Canoe, Legal Director, Aboriginal Legal Services Toronto. \"How is it her victimization -\u00a0 in this case homicide -\u00a0 is outweighed by the minor offences that exists on her criminal record?\" she said.\u00a0 Big Canoe points out the province had a choice when it denied Poorman's application. The Victims' Bill of Rights says \"the director may... deny or reduce the amount of compensation payable.\" \u00a0\u00a0 That means there is wiggle room, Big Canoe says,\u00a0because \"when the word 'may' is used, it means there is discretion, so this is a policy choice or a directive.\" The Victims' Bill of Rights was changed in 2011 to allow for the exclusion of people with recent minor criminal convictions. At the time, the intent was to quell criticism that criminals were getting benefits as a result of injuries sustained in the commission of crimes. \"The intent of the law is that there is no discretion for the victims' services office, but there is the appeals process and the director can then take another look at it,\" said Rachel Morgan, a government spokesperson.\u00a0\u00a0 Aboriginal people shut out of victim compensation rules Manitoba's victim compensation laws end up excluding a large number of aboriginal people by virtue of their over-representation in the criminal justice system, explained Big Canoe. In the past five years of available data, the amount paid out per year in victim compensation has gone from a high of $3.9 million in 2009/10 \u00a0to to $3.3 million in 2013/14. \u00a0\"There is a consideration tax dollars should not be spent on criminals and there is no space or means for compassionate grounds or exceptions. Those are the things that should be built in that are lacking,\" she added. Poorman can't understand why the province would deny her burial costs after she has been through so much.\u00a0 \"I just don't understand their laws. I just don't know how they can treat people like this,\" she said. The province issued a statement which said Poorman may be entitled to compensation from its Employment and Income Assistance department for the funeral expenses and that EIA staff have been trying to contact her in order to provide payment.\u00a0 Poorman says her numerous phone calls to EIA have not been returned since February.

But many relatives of the murdered and missing want it to do so.Delores Daniels holds a photo of her daughter Serena McKay, who was murdered three months ago in Sagkeeng, during a press conference calling for a re-organization of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) in Winnipeg on July 12, 2017.\u00a0\u00a0(JOHN WOODS / THE CANADIAN PRESS)\u00a0\u00a0By Thomas WalkomNational Affairs ColumnistMon., July 31, 2017The troubled National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls has long been an idea at war with itself.On the one hand and like most royal commissions, it is trying to focus on broad structural questions. Why are Indigenous women and girls more at risk of violence than their non-Indigenous counterparts? What can be done to improve the situation? What role does systemic racism play?On the other, it is supposed to provide some form of comfort to real, individual Indigenous families who have lost female relatives and want to know what happened to them.When Canada\u2019s Liberal government set up the inquiry last year, it hoped the commissioners it appointed would somehow be able to do both. The events of the past few weeks demonstrate how difficult that task is.Article Continued BelowThe inquiry is in chaos. Five senior officials, including one commissioner, have quit. The remaining four commissioners narrowly escaped a motion of censure last week from the influential Assembly of First Nations, which wants the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference rewritten.The inquiry has barely begun to hear oral evidence. It will be hard-pressed to meet its November 2018 deadline for issuing a final report. It will almost certainly exceed its $53.8 million budget.At root is the fundamental confusion over the inquiry\u2019s purpose. Its terms of reference specify that it is to report on \u201csystemic causes of all forms of violence \u2014 including sexual violence \u2014 against Indigenous women and girls in Canada, including underlying social, economic, cultural, institutional and historical causes.\u201dBut they also specify that the inquiry is to recommend \u201cways to honour and commemorate\u201d the missing and murdered females.Many of the families of the missing and murdered argue \u2014 understandably \u2014 that the best way to honour their relatives is to find out what happened to them.A significant number say they are not satisfied with police explanations.But as the inquiry notes on its website, under its terms of reference it cannot reopen police investigations.It can refer what it considers questionable police practices to the \u201cappropriate authorities\u201d but it can\u2019t investigate on its own.As Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett explained last year, this limitation was part of a deliberate effort to prevent the inquiry from deteriorating into a standoff between relatives and police with both sides \u201clawyering up.\u201dThe government\u2019s main aim, she said then, was to get to \u201cthe root cause of systemic violence.\u201dThe relatives can be forgiven for thinking that this is not enough. The root causes of systemic violence against Indigenous women are already well-documented.The 1996 Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples blamed a cycle of despair rooted in a history of broken treaties and cultural demoralization. British Columbia\u2019s 2012 Report of the Missing Women Commission of Inquiry singled out \u201cthe legacy of colonialism in Canada.\u201dOther reports, both government and non-government, have come up with similar conclusions. And the Liberals expect this one to do the same.As Patty Hajdu, then status of women minister, put it last year, this inquiry \u201cmust also examine how racism and sexism are embedded in the very institutions that are supposed to help and protect women and girls.\u201dAll of this may be very well. But what so many of the relatives really want to know, it seems, is what happened to their specific mothers, daughters and aunts \u2014 and why police didn\u2019t put more effort into trying to answer these questions.The inquiry does have the authority to look, in general, at how police treat cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women. On Thursday it issued a statement reconfirming its intention to do so.Will that be enough to satisfy the relatives and keep this shaky, dual-purpose inquiry on an even keel? I\u2019m not sure it will.Thomas Walkom appears Monday, Wednesday and Friday.Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines\u00a0NewsletterSubscribeThe Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E\u00a01E6.

Specific outcomes include the commitment to gather again in 2016 to assess progress.\u00a0 \n\nThe National Roundtable is a result of support expressed by Premiers at a meeting with National Aboriginal Organizations in August 2014.\n\n\nHighlights: \n\n\nThree priority areas were the focus of roundtable discussion and delegates agreed to coordinate efforts toward tangible and immediate action in each.\u00a0 \n\nPrevention and Awareness\n\nRaising public awareness aimed at changing attitudes that devalue Indigenous women and girls and the contributions of Indigenous Peoples as an educational tool for violence prevention.\u00a0\u00a0 \nReducing the marginalization of Indigenous women and girls by improving socio-economic development and outcomes. \nImproving prevention and responses to violence within intimate relationships and families.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nCommunity Safety\n\nSupporting Indigenous communities, organizations and individuals to develop safety initiatives that respond to their unique cultural, traditional and socio-economic needs and realities. \nEngaging communities, governments, organizations and institutions, in supporting prevention, action, and intervention when violence has occurred. \nSupporting and addressing safety and healing of individuals, families and communities. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPolicing Measures and Justice Responses\n\nImproving the relationship between justice sector professionals, including police, and Indigenous Peoples and strengthening community-based policing in Indigenous communities. \nIdentifying strategies within the justice system to protect and assist Indigenous women and girls who are victims of violence. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOutcomes and Next Steps:\n\n\nDelegates of the National Roundtable commit to continuing to work together in coordinating action to prevent and end violence against Indigenous women and girls, including the commitment to a second National Roundtable to be held in 2016.\u00a0 All Parties committed to working directly with Indigenous communities and organizations to move forward on Roundtable commitments to discuss efforts underway, progress and areas for further focus.\u00a0 Parties to the National Roundtable commit to using their respective reporting and accountability mechanisms to report on their activities and progress and will increase efforts at enhanced public reporting, and sharing information on effective collaboration efforts both within and across jurisdictions, organizations and communities.\u00a0 \n\nParties to the National Roundtable further committed to the development of a prevention and awareness campaign and accepted an invitation from the Province of Manitoba to host an inaugural forum to explore best practices and better coordinate and share information on policing and justice responses.\u00a0 \n\nQuotes:\n\n\nCeremonial Family Witness Judy Maas from Blueberry River First Nation:\u00a0 \"We will idle no more as our sisters, mothers, daughters, aunties, and grandmothers go missing and continue to be violated by any type of violence.\u00a0 We will no longer remain invisible.\u00a0 We will take our rightful place.\u00a0 Our voices are the voices of those who have suffered.\u00a0 Our children deserve better. We expect nothing less than a formal commitment by governments to implement the recommendations being heard.\"\n\n\nMinister of Labour and Minister of Status of Women Dr. K. Kellie Leitch, P.C., O.Ont., M.P.:\u00a0 \"Our Government understands the heavy toll that violence has on victims, families, and communities. That's why we are committed to taking concrete actions that address family violence and violent crimes against Aboriginal women and girls. And because everyone has a role to play, the Government of Canada will continue working collaboratively with provinces and territories, Aboriginal families, communities and organizations, to address this important issue.\"\u00a0\n\n\nMinister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Bernard Valcourt:\u00a0 \"Our Government recognizes that addressing violence against Aboriginal women is a shared responsibility that requires commitment to action from all partners, including at the community level. By meeting today and continuing to work together, we are sending a strong message that these abhorrent acts of violence will not be tolerated.\"\n\n\nAssembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde: \"I commend the strength of the families of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and the leadership of Indigenous organizations, provinces, territories and the federal government for coming together for this unprecedented gathering.\u00a0 Ending violence must be a national priority and we must work together to ensure to uphold the fundamental right to life and security for every Indigenous woman and girl and to live free of discrimination. \u00a0The commitments we made today must translate into action on the ground to keep Indigenous women and girls safe and secure.\u00a0 We will continue to work with Indigenous families, organizations and all levels of governments to end violence and we will continue the push for a National Public Inquiry to seek justice and to move on long-term solutions.\"\n\n\nCongress of Aboriginal Peoples National Chief Betty Ann Lavall\u00e9e: \"This meeting was a constructive step forward, but there is much more to do.\u00a0 The spirits of our sisters will not rest until justice is done and neither will we.\"\n\n\nInuit Tapiriit Kanatami President Terry Audla: \"There is no one-size-fits all approach to addressing some of the significant issues we have been wrestling with today. Inuit welcome the commitments reached at this meeting and look forward to working with provincial, territorial and federal governments to develop specific means of addressing our most pressing needs, respecting the fact that violence has a human cost, and it also has an economic cost. Inuit live in some of the most remote communities in Canada, and the delivery of and access to programs and services in our homeland will always cost more than it does to provide those same programs and services in Southern Canada.\"\n\n\nM\u00e9tis National Council President Cl\u00e9ment Chartier: M\u00e9tis National Council President Cl\u00e9ment Chartier: \"The M\u00e9tis Nation is pleased to witness the forward movement on addressing this most critical matter. \u00a0The issue of murdered and missing Aboriginal women and girls has been plaguing our communities for far too long and concrete solutions must be explored and implemented. \u00a0I congratulate the leadership of both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal governments and organizations for taking this progressive step and thank the affected families for their continued determination to seek the justice this violation of life is demanding.\"\n\n\nLes Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak / Women of the M\u00e9tis Nation President Melanie Omeniho: \"I acknowledge the work that has been achieved by bringing together the National Aboriginal Organizations, provinces, territories, \u00a0the federal government and representatives from the families of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women for this unique meeting. The life, safety and security of Indigenous women, which includes Metis women is a priority for Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak. It is an exceptional opportunity to work with other Aboriginal representative organizations and the various levels of government to build on a collective action plan that will assist us in addressing the overwhelming issues that result from the level of violence that some Indigenous women have been a victim of.\"\n\n\nNative Women's Association of Canada Interim Action President Dr. Dawn Harvard: \"We must work together \u2013 Aboriginal Peoples and all levels Governments to put in place measures that protect Aboriginal women and girls. Anything less is a denial of our basic human rights. The provinces and territories and Aboriginal Peoples have all supported the call for a national public inquiry and now we need to work together, along with the Federal Government to implement a comprehensive, national framework of action to end violence!\"\n\n\nPauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada President Rebecca Kudloo: \"We know that Inuit women and children are at the greatest risk of violence in their homes and our members feel prevention is the most important and urgent issue to be addressed after this roundtable. They have told us that unresolved trauma and abuse is the most significant underlying cause to be addressed, and we look forward to a whole-of-government response in working together to address this major physical and mental health issue.\"\n\n\nAlberta Legislative Secretary for Aboriginal Education and Jobs, Skills, and Training Pearl Calahasen: \"The discussions we had at today's national roundtable were incredibly valuable. The Alberta government remains committed to taking action on the issue of missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls by continuing its work with Aboriginal leaders, communities and organizations to find solutions. \" \n\nBritish Columbia Minister of Aboriginal Relations and Reconciliation John Rustad:\u00a0 \"This significant gathering has resulted in a level of discussion never seen before and I thank the family members of missing and murdered Aboriginal women who dedicated their time and displayed great courage telling their stories. The B.C. government has taken action on all major themes from our provincial Missing Women Commission of Inquiry and we will continue to work with our Aboriginal partners on the systemic changes needed to create a legacy of safety for Aboriginal women and girls. This work, and our efforts nationwide, will be enriched by today's dialogue.\" \n\nManitoba Premier Gregory Selinger: \"This roundtable is about the families from across the country who have suffered an unimaginable and tragic loss.\u00a0 Mothers, daughter, sisters and wives have been taken from them and their families are left behind to pick up the pieces. For some families, they have the heartbreaking task of caring for children who will never see their mothers again.\u00a0 This gathering helps us to move forward on addressing the critical issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada.\"\n\n\nNew Brunswick Minister Responsible for the Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat Dr. Ed. Doherty M.D.: \"Violence against Aboriginal women and girls impacts Aboriginal communities and families throughout New Brunswick. We are pleased to have this opportunity to work together and stimulate discussion and collaboration in addressing violence against aboriginal women and girls not only in New Brunswick, but across the country\". \u00a0\n\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador Minister of Justice and Public Safety and Attorney General Judy Manning: \"In 2014, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador supported a provincial, all-party resolution calling for a national inquiry into missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls. We are prepared to work with the Government of Canada on such an initiative and committed to cooperating with all jurisdictions to eliminate all forms of violence against Aboriginal women and girls. We acknowledge those families and individuals that attended the Family and Peoples Gatherings, and we thank them for having the courage to share their stories.\"\n\n\nNorthwest Territories Premier Bob Mcleod: \"Our experience in the Northwest Territories is that we are stronger and more successful when we work together as partners. This has been at the foundation of our commitment to engage with Aboriginal governments and organizations in the spirit of respect, recognition and responsibility. As the Chair of the National Roundtable I am very encouraged by the willingness of all the participants to engage in a meaningful national dialogue about concrete action and solutions to address the crisis of violence against Indigenous women and girls.\"\n\n\nNova Scotia's Minister of Community Services and Status of Women Joanne Bernard: \"I am honoured to have participated in this important and timely discussion. I urge all Canadians to become more engaged and aware as we move to address the disproportionate rates of missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls.\" \n\nNunavut Minister of Family Services Jeannie Ugyuk: \"Keeping Indigenous women and girls safe and well is a shared, national responsibility; one that can no longer be ignored. I am humbled to have been part of today's gathering. On behalf of the Government of Nunavut, I commit to working towards a framework to end this violence once and for all.\"\n\n\nOntario Premier Kathleen Wynne: \"Too many Aboriginal women and girls have experienced violence, been murdered or gone missing. This loss not only affects aboriginal communities across the country, but Canada as a whole. I am proud that Ontario has joined leaders across Canada to ensure that Aboriginal women and girls can live safely and reach their full potential.\"\n\n\nPrince Edward Island Minister of Community Services and Seniors and Minister\u00a0Responsible for the Status of Women Valerie E. Docherty:\u00a0 \"Now is the time to take action\u00a0and address the crisis of the\u00a0disproportionate number of indigenous women and girls who are missing or murdered in Canada. By working together\u00a0respectfully we\u00a0can improve the lives of Indigenous women, girls and their families. I am hopeful that the work accomplished today will initiate collaborative efforts from all levels of government and Aboriginal organizations that will result in achievable action items.\"\n\n\nQuebec Minister responsible for Native Affairs Geoffrey Kelley, and Minister of Justice Ms. St\u00e9phanie Vall\u00e9e:\u00a0 \"In August 2014, during the meetings of the Council of the Federation, the Government of Quebec supported the proposal by First Nations members that a national roundtable be created to study the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women.\u00a0 We are already working on the wide variety of issues that arise from violence against Indigenous women with First Nations organizations in Qu\u00e9bec, but we know that we can always do more.\u00a0 Our presence here today is a reflection of our willingness to collaborate with the other provinces as well as the federal government to share our resources and our experiences so as to end violence against Indigenous women and girls.\"\n\n\nSaskatchewan Minister of Justice and Attorney General Gordon Wyant:\u00a0 \"I'm proud of the services offered in Saskatchewan to help address violence against Aboriginal women and girls, as well as initiatives geared towards prevention and awareness. We recognize that more needs to be done and by working together, we can share ideas and develop appropriate responses to reduce the risk of violence against Aboriginal women across the country.\"\n\n\nYukon Premier Darrell Pasloski:\u00a0 \"On behalf of the Government of Yukon and all Yukoners, I reaffirm our commitment to preventing violence against Aboriginal women and girls. I also want to acknowledge the strength and resilience of the family members who attended the roundtable, and the determination of everyone here to create communities where Aboriginal women and girls are safe.\"\n\n\nNATIONAL ROUNDTABLE ON MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN AND GIRLS\n\n\nFRAMEWORK FOR ACTION TO PREVENT AND ADDRESS VIOLENCE AGAINST INDIGENOUS WOMEN AND GIRLS \n\n\nINTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE\n\n\nThe goals of the National Roundtable are to: \n\nCreate a dialogue with all levels of government, Indigenous[1] representatives and families to effectively address the crisis of violence against Indigenous women and girls. \nIdentify solutions and collaborative means of moving them forward, including the ongoing engagement of Indigenous Peoples, families and communities in reducing and eliminating all forms of violence. \n\nThe National Roundtable brings together federal, provincial and territorial governments in partnership with National Aboriginal Organizations (NAOs) to discuss how best to collaborate and coordinate action to prevent and address violence against Indigenous women and girls, including those cases that result in their murder or disappearance.\u00a0 As noted in the 2014 Federal Action Plan to Address Family Violence and Violent Crimes Against Aboriginal Women and Girls \"\u2026no organization or level of government alone can eradicate this violence.\u00a0 This work must be done in partnership across federal organizations, with provinces and territories and through the leadership of Aboriginal communities and organizations.\" \n\nAll Indigenous women and children have an equal right to live free of violence and all forms of discrimination. \u00a0In recent years, there have been a number of initiatives aimed at responding to the prevalence of violence against Indigenous women and girls, including the disproportionate rates of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada. \u00a0A variety of responses and actions have been developed by communities and governments, including provincial, territorial, federal and Indigenous governments, however no comprehensive and coordinated response exists.\u00a0 Such a response would bring broader attention, education and focus to prevention and immediate solutions, while enabling local flexibility and decision-making. \n\nTo move this dialogue forward and initiate coordinated action, the following three priority areas have been identified for discussion at the National Roundtable to address the disproportionate number of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls: \n\nPrevention and Awareness \nCommunity Safety \nPolicing Measures and Justice Responses\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPRINCIPLES\n\n\nThere is consensus that additional action must be taken now and increased efforts need to be made to assess our progress while ensuring that everything possible is being done for the safety and security of Indigenous women and girls. The National Roundtable presents a unique opportunity for federal, provincial and territorial governments to come together with NAOs and representatives from the families of murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls to move on coordinated actions, prevention and solutions. \n\nIt is anticipated that the National Roundtable will result in commitments to prevent, reduce and eliminate violence against Indigenous women and girls, focusing on the three priority areas. \u00a0Parties to the National Roundtable believe an important foundation for this Framework is agreement on a set of common principles that guide how the Parties work together to prevent and address violence against Indigenous women and girls. \u00a0Parties to the National Roundtable endorse the following principles:\n\n\nHuman Rights: Violence against Indigenous women and girls implicates numerous human rights including the right to life, to security, to equality and to be free of discrimination.\n\n\nShared responsibility: Preventing and addressing violence against Indigenous women and children is a shared responsibility, requiring shared commitments across governments and communities.\n\n\nCommunity-based solutions:\u00a0 Solutions to prevent and end violence against Indigenous women and girls must be community-based and led, recognizing the diversity of community situations, and appropriate support given to building community capacity. \n\nA focus on healing: Addressing violence against Indigenous women and children acknowledges the need for improved relationships based on respect and understanding among Indigenous Peoples and non-Indigenous Canadians, and the need for holistic approaches in concert with support for the healing of individuals and communities. \n\nA collaborative focus: Indigenous Peoples must be partners in developing and implementing responses to addressing violence against Indigenous women and girls. \n\nBringing about behavioral change: Addressing and preventing violence against Indigenous women and girls requires a shift in societal attitudes and behaviours, within individuals, institutions and organizations, including men and boys, who are key agents of that change.\n\n\nChanging the discourse: Mobilizing Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities to change how we talk about the issues can help re-frame institutional responses, community perspectives and individual attitudes. \n\nThese principles underlie recent work as noted in the reports cited in this Framework document that have identified paths forward in developing community-based approaches to ending violence against Indigenous women and girls.\u00a0 \n\nPATHWAYS FORWARD \n\n\nAs a result of the National Roundtable, each federal, provincial and territorial government and each NAO will coordinate efforts toward tangible and immediate actions in each of the priority areas. \u00a0Together this will constitute a shared national commitment to increased, ongoing collaboration with the development of regionally and community-based and community-driven solutions to prevent and address violence against Indigenous women and girls.\n\n\nParties to the National Roundtable have agreed to improve coordination and collaboration across sectors, and amongst each other, along the following high-level pathways, recognizing these areas are fundamentally interconnected and must not be viewed in isolation. \n\nDiscussion continues among Parties to the National Roundtable on specific examples of how these pathways can be implemented.\u00a0 Means and processes for implementation will vary based on relationships and priorities among Indigenous communities and organizations and provincial, territorial and federal governments.\n\n\nPrevention and Awareness\n\n\nRaising public awareness aimed at changing attitudes that devalue Indigenous women and girls and the contributions of Indigenous Peoples as an educational tool for violence prevention.\u00a0 \u00a0 \nReducing the marginalization of Indigenous women and girls by improving socio-economic development and outcomes. \nImproving prevention and responses to violence within intimate relationships and families.\n\nCommunity Safety\n\n\nSupporting Indigenous communities, organizations and individuals to develop safety initiatives that respond to their unique cultural, traditional and socio-economic needs and realities. \nEngaging communities, governments, organizations and institutions, in supporting prevention, action, and intervention when violence has occurred. \nSupporting and addressing safety and healing of individuals, families and communities.\u00a0\n\nPolicing Measures and Justice Responses\n\n\nImproving the relationship between justice sector professionals, including police, and Indigenous Peoples and strengthening community-based policing in Indigenous communities. \nIdentifying strategies within the justice system to protect and assist Indigenous women and girls who are victims of violence. \n\nFOLLOW-UP AND SHARING OF OUTCOMES\u00a0\n\n\nAll Parties to the National Roundtable commit to continuing to work together in coordinating action to prevent and end violence against Indigenous women and girls.\u00a0 To further solidify these efforts a 2nd National Roundtable will be held by the end of 2016 to discuss progress and continue dialogue on efforts underway and areas for further focus.\u00a0 All Parties commit to work directly with Indigenous communities and organizations to move forward on these priorities and in preparation for the 2nd National Roundtable. \n\nPublic accountability is paramount to the continued progress in addressing violence against Indigenous women and girls, including the tragedy of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\u00a0 Accordingly, Parties to the National Roundtable commit to using their respective reporting and accountability mechanisms to report on their activities and progress and will increase efforts at enhanced public reporting, and sharing information on effective collaboration efforts both within and across jurisdictions, organizations and communities.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nBACKGROUND/CONTEXT\n\n\nIt is well understood there are complex and long-standing underlying issues that have brought us to where we are today in respect of the disproportionate levels of violence against Indigenous women and girls which perpetuate this critical situation.\u00a0 Indigenous women and girls are three times more likely to experience violence than non-Indigenous women and this violence results in more serious harm.\u00a0 In May 2014, the RCMP released a National Operational Overview on Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women.\u00a0 The research identified 1,181 missing and murdered Aboriginal women in Canadian police databases between 1980 and 2012; of those \u00a01,017 were murdered, and there are 164 investigations of missing Aboriginal women dating back to 1952.\u00a0 \n\nIndigenous Peoples are not a homogeneous group culturally, traditionally or geographically.\u00a0 Diversity and distinctions exist between and within First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis Peoples based on a number of factors including language, cultural beliefs, social structures, geography, governance structures and the existence of Treaties and other agreements with the Crown in some areas. This means effective solutions must be community-based and community-driven. In recognition of this diversity and differences in documented outcomes for various First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis Peoples, special attention needs to be given to the development of responses that reflect these differences.\u00a0 Additionally, the varying needs and perspectives of women, youth, Elders, urban, northern and remote populations must also be taken into account. \n\nThe safety and well-being of Indigenous women and girls is integral to ensuring healthy and prosperous Indigenous families, communities and nations within Canada. There is no more important role for governments or the state than protecting citizens. Equally, there is no more important role for families or communities than keeping each other safe and promoting safety.\u00a0 \n\nNumerous reports, forums and inquiries have brought attention to this issue, including the seminal Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996), the Manitoba Aboriginal Justice Inquiry, (1999), Amnesty International's Stolen Sisters Report (2004), the BC Missing Women Commission of Inquiry (2012), the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights report on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in British Columbia, Canada (2014) and each of the reports from the National Aboriginal Women's Summits 2007-2014. \n\nJurisdictions and Indigenous communities have responded with a range of activities.\u00a0\u00a0 Additionally, there are a number of cross-jurisdictional efforts underway to address violence against Aboriginal women and girls in Canada. Frameworks have been developed by the Aboriginal Affairs Ministers and National Aboriginal Leaders Working Group (Framework for Coordinating Action to End Violence Against Aboriginal Women and Girls), the Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) Ministers of Justice and Public Safety (Draft Justice Framework to Address Violence Against Aboriginal Women and Girls) and the FPT Forum of Ministers Responsible for the Status of Women endorsed the Iqaluit Declaration in 2007 to address violence against Aboriginal women.\n\n\nFederally, a Special Parliamentary Committee on Violence Against Indigenous Women and Girls released its report Invisible Women: A Call to Action \u2013 A Report on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in Canada in March 2014.\u00a0 The Government of Canada provided a response to this report in September 2014 in the 2014 Federal Action Plan to Address Family Violence and Violent Crimes Against Aboriginal Women and Girls.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n[1] Indigenous refers to Inuit, M\u00e9tis and First Nations peoples in Canada. Parties to the National Roundtable acknowledge specific needs that arise as a result of urban/rural/northern and on/off reserve-based considerations, Inuit Nunangat considerations, the application of the Indian Act, and gender issues. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSOURCE  Assembly of First Nations\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\tFor further information: Patricia D'Souza, Senior Communications Officer, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, 613-292-4482 mobile, dsouza@itk.ca; Daniel Wilson, Director of Policy and Media Relations, Congress of Aboriginal Peoples 613-747-6022 ext 202 OR 613-809-8147 mobile, d.wilson@abo-peoples.org; Claudette Dumont-Smith, Executive Director, Native Women's Association of Canada, 613-722-3033 ext. 223 or cdumontsmith@nwac.ca OR Gail Gallagher 613-722-3033 ext. 225, ggallagher@nwac.ca, 613-290-5680; Jenna Young Castro Communications Officer, Assembly of First Nations, 613-314-8157 mobile jyoung@afn.ca; Alain Garon, Bilingual Communications Officer, Assembly of First Nations 613-292-0857 mobile agaron@afn.ca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n        French version\n        \n\n\n\nOrganization Profile\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n              Assembly of First Nations\n\n\nVisit website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2015 CNW Group Ltd.\n\n\nFran\u00e7ais\n\nPrivacy & Terms of Use\nCareers\nMedia Partners\nRSS Feeds\nTwitter\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Indigenous Women and Girls, in Membertou, N.S., on Oct. 30, 2017.\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA young Inuk woman suffering from acute liver failure is being assessed at an organ transplant centre in Toronto after her family from Labrador launched a campaign to overturn earlier refusals to put her on a transplant waiting list.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to friends and family, doctors had told Delilah Saunders she was not eligible to go on a waiting list in Ontario because the advocate for Indigenous rights had not abstained from alcohol for a minimum of six months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, help us get the word out. My dear friend Delilah Saunders is critically ill in the Ottawa Hospital in need of a liver transplant. Her transplant is being denied due to a discriminatory policy.

It feels criminal.\"\nAmnesty International issued a statement supporting Delilah's Saunders' inclusion on the waiting list, and praised her for her work advocating for the human rights of Innu and other Indigenous women.\nSaunders began advocating for the rights and missing and murdered indigenous women following the murder of her sister Loretta in 2014 in Halifax.\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVigil On Parliament Hill For Loretta Saunders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVigil On Parliament Hill For Loretta Saunders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nof\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this slide:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE:Delilah SaundersHealthIndigenousInukliver transplantLoretta SaundersNewstransplant waiting list\nSuggest a correction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\n\n\n\nCanadian Billionaire Couple Found Dead In Toronto Home\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20 Christmas Gifts Your Boyfriend Will Love\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese Are The Canadians You'll Most Likely See At The Royal Wedding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13 Great Secret Santa Gifts Under $25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanada Has A Record 361,700 Unfilled Jobs.

Tolley has been involved in the annual Sisters in Spirit vigils to remember nearly 1,200 murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls.\u00a0\u00a0(Justin Tang / THE CANADIAN PRESS)\u00a0\u00a0By Tanya TalagaStaff ReporterTues., Oct. 3, 2017Bridget Tolley said she never invited Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the vigil she was holding on Parliament Hill last year, but his office called and asked to come. For years, Tolley has been involved in the annual Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada\u2019s Sisters in Spirit vigils to remember nearly 1,200 murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls (MMIWG) that are held from coast to coast to coast every year on Oct. 4. The day is meant to be non-political, a day of remembrance for families and all who mourn stolen sisters, aunts, partners, mothers, daughters and friends.\u201cThis is all about our missing sisters,\u201d said Tolley, who lost her mother Gladys Tolley on Oct. 5, 2001 after she was struck by a S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec police cruiser as she walked across a two-lane highway on the Kitigan Zibi-Anishinabeg First Nation, north of Ottawa. A police investigation into her death revealed no wrongdoing and called the case an accident. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I am still doing this,\u201d said the grandmother. She has fought, unsuccessfully, for years to get her mother\u2019s case re-opened and independently investigated. \u201cThis year, I want to fill the Hill.\u201dThis year, she is expecting the prime minister to return to the steps of the Parliament Hill at noon, along with Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau, and remember with them and perhaps speak to some of the families gathered. \u201cI want to hear it straight from him,\u201d she said. Also expected are the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Carolyn Bennett and Minister of Indigenous Services Jane Philpott.Article Continued BelowAfter the vigil, there will be a traditional feast for the families in the Centre Block hosted by New Democratic Party MP\u2019s including Romeo Saganash.At least 200 vigils will occur on Oct. 4 at various times throughout the day. The vigils can take many forms. Some are moments of silence, others are assemblies in school gymnasiums, feasts or a gathering of families who are coming together for mutual support and remembrance.Tolley hopes that on Wednesday everyone will put their concerns surrounding the problem-plagued national inquiry into MMIWG aside and they will focus on what is important \u2014 the lost women and girls and the families left behind. The inquiry, which just wrapped up family hearings in Smithers, B.C., has struggled with senior staff resignations and accusations of poor communications with families.\u201cI know it is so hard with all the divisions right now. I hope we can all unite. We all started off together by honouring them. I just hope we can continue. This is about them and for them. I am calling for unity,\u201d said Tolley.Francyne Joe, NWAC president, will be at the Ottawa vigil. She is also hoping to see MMIWG National Inquiry Commissioner Michelle Audet.\u201cI think the families need to see the commissioners as part of this event,\u201d said Joe. \u201cAt the Oct. 4 vigils \u2014 there should be no political platforms. This is a moment where we honour the MMIWG and also pay respect to the families involved. We are hoping the families will be encouraged by the support they are getting across Canada,\u201d Joe said.\u201cThis is a moment where families can get together. They may have bonded over previous vigils and programs before but it is an important they get together now,\u201d Joe said.Read more about: Quebec, Justin TrudeauDelivered dailyThe Morning Headlines\u00a0NewsletterSubscribeThe Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E\u00a01E6.

We can't shy away from any aspect of this if we want really good solutions, if we want to really understand the enormity of the problem.\"\nLavell-Harvard said it is already clear women lack safe places to go when they are in crisis; her association\u00a0has been calling for years on the federal government to build more shelter facilities.\n\"That needs to be addressed right away,\" she said. \"We don't need to wait two years for an inquiry to tell us something ... we knew going into this conversation.\"\n\u2014Follow @kkirkup on Twitter\nKristy Kirkup, The Canadian Press\n\u00a92016 The Canadian Press\n\nShare Twitter\nFacebook\nGoogle+\nReddit\nForward\n \nTopics:\u00a0\nNational\n\n\nJoin the Discussion\nNews Talk 650 CKOM is happy to provide a forum for commenting and discussion.

The rationale is that if people can abstain for some time prior to a transplant, they can abstain for some time afterwards,\" he said in an interview.\nMoore said Saunders' family is considering\u00a0a court injunction.\nShe says\u00a0her friend\u00a0is anxious to take part\u00a0in a Trillium pilot project, beginning in August, that will waive the abstinence policy for some alcoholics\u00a0who agree to\u00a0receive support for dealing\u00a0with their addiction.\nMoore said the abstinence policy is\u00a0preventing her and others from offering themselves as possible\u00a0donors, while Saunders remains hooked up to hospital machinery\u00a0to keep her alive. She was admitted to the hospital on Saturday.\n\"It's frustrating wanting to be able to go and get tested to see if you're a match to save your best friend's life but being told, 'No, they're not even going to give it a chance,'\" said Moore.\nHumar said doctors must also consider that if they transplant a living person's liver to another person, there should be a\u00a0high likelihood of success.\n\"It's a major operation and we only want to do that if we're sure the transplant will be successful.\"\nThe doctor said\u00a0there is significant shortage of donated livers. As a result,\u00a0about one third of the people in the\u00a0program die while awaiting a transplant.\nSaunders\u00a0is the sister of Loretta Saunders,\u00a0who was murdered\u00a0three years ago\u00a0by two people\u00a0subletting her Halifax apartment.\nThe Saunders' family recently gave emotionally charged testimony before the National Inquiry into Murder and Missing Women and Girls at Membertou First Nation in Cape Breton.\nAs for the challenges Saunders\u00a0faces in getting a transplant, her case is the latest in a series of similar cases in recent years.\nCary Gallant, a 45-year-old alcoholic denied access to the Ontario wait list, had launched a case in the fall challenging the constitutionality of Trillium's rule.\nGallant's goal was to have Trillium agree to assess patients who consume alcohol on a case-by-case basis for possible waivers.\nDebra Selkirk, whose husband Mark died from liver disease, had planned a constitutional challenge of the six-month policy when\u00a0he was refused a transplant.\nShe\u00a0said she dropped her two-year fight due Trillium's commitment to\u00a0start the pilot project and to provide transplants to almost 100 patients with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\"I think an exception should be made for everybody,\" she said. \"I think they should start transplanting now.\"\nA spokeswoman for Trillium did not respond to a request for an interview on the medical reasons for its policy.\nHowever, Jennifer Long wrote that the agency is \"in the midst of finalizing the pilot program.\"\nHumar said there is variation in existing research on what percentage of alcoholics who are provided with transplanted livers will return to drinking.\n\"In patients transplanted for alcoholic liver disease the (rates of recidivism) is anywhere from 10 to 40 per cent. It varies a lot on the types of patients transplanted, how long they've been abstinent and what kind of addictions support you have on hand for those kinds of patients.\"\nFollow (at)mtuttoncporg on Twitter.\nMichael Tutton, The Canadian Press\n \n\n\n\n\n\n            Report a Typo or Error\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideos\nAll videos\n\n\nLatest\nEditor's picks\nMost viewed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBank of Canada governor on creat...\n\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton hopes Alabama wi...\n\n\n\n\nBill Morneau explains revisions ...\n\n\n\n\nJustin Trudeau helps unveil Cent...\n\n\n\n\nJagmeet Singh not \u2018discouraged...\n\n\n\n\nExperienced defence expected on ...\n\n\n\n\nJody Wilson-Raybould praises new...\n\n\n\n\nWhat Canada\u2019s next space stati...\n\n\n\n\nJustin Trudeau congratulates bye...\n\n\n\n\nFeds strike deal with provinces ...\n\n\n\n\nPremier: Completing Site C dam i...\n\n\n\n\nTrailer park residents speak out...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRCMP revise death toll to four i...\n\n\n\n\nRaw: Sheep Flock Brings Car Chas...\n\n\n\n\nArmed Rancher: 'We Want All Peop...\n\n\n\n\nNew TVs Promise Sharper Color, B...\n\n\n\n\nSecond City improv class designe...\n\n\n\n\nIce castle opens in Edmonton\n\n\n\n\nRaw: Piglets Escape When Truck O...\n\n\n\n\nFor Santa Sightings, Tourists Fl...\n\n\n\n\nResearchers Use WiFi To See Thro...\n\n\n\n\nSpaceX Sucessfully Lands Spent R...\n\n\n\n\nAstronauts Fix Jammed Station du...\n\n\n\n\nNew Windshields Made From Smartp...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEast Tracadie home invaded by 50...\n\n\n\n\nGarnier says in court video he h...\n\n\n\n\nberniejagfinal720\n\n\n\n\nJustin Trudeau says Canada\u2019s e...\n\n\n\n\nYoung Farmers\n\n\n\n\nPolice interview Christopher Gar...\n\n\n\n\nMontreal-based toymaker seeks ho...\n\n\n\n\nImpaired driving collision\n\n\n\n\nHehr says he\u2019ll work on sensit...\n\n\n\n\nThird Pedestrian Struck by Taxi\n\n\n\n\nFeisty Anne Spencer recounts the...\n\n\n\n\nTeam Gushue Aerial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nleftThe Shine Factory $100 Gift Certificate Antigonish, NS: $100.00BUY NOW FOR $80.00 Herald Water Bottle: $12.99BUY NOW FOR $8.00 Herald Umbrella: $34.99BUY NOW FOR $20.00 Organic Earth Market $200 Gift Card: $200.00BUY NOW FOR $165.00 Sid's Second - 11 x 17 Poster Reprint: $13.04BUY NOW FOR $13.04 Oasis Motel & Campground: $50.00BUY NOW FOR $30.00 Spinners Men's Wear $50 Gift Card: $50.00BUY NOW FOR $30.00 Suttles and Seawinds $100 Gift Card: $100.00BUY NOW FOR $60.00 right \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nTop Stories in CanadaNew round of CPP changes end age restrictions on survivor benefitsSexual masochism expert takes stand at murder trial in death of off-duty copInuk women's advocate rejected for liver transplant due to alcoholism: friendsDebt-to-household-income ratio rises in third quarter, household net worthIn the news today, Dec. 14Halifax police charge 66-year-old man with manslaughter in manor pushing deathB.C. man found guilty of polygamy believed he couldn't be prosecuted: lawyerTrademark for proposed Atlantic Schooners CFL football team quietly securedBaloney Meter: Are Australian fighter jets a 'rusted-out bucket of bolts'?National clean fuels strategy will affect all forms of fuels in Canada \n\n\nMost Discussed\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\nHome\nMetro\nNova Scotia\nCanada\nWorld\nBusiness\nSports\nLifestyles\nTravel\nBooks\nMovies\nThe Nova Scotian\n\n\n\nCommunity\nCommunity News\n\n\n\n\n\nOpinions\nEditorials\nColumnists\nNews Columns\nBusiness Columns\nSports Columns\nLifestyles Columns\nEditorial Cartoon\n\n\n\nAnnouncements\nObituaries\nBirths\nCards\nIn Memoriam\nMilestones\nContact us to place an Announcement\n\n\n\n\n\nMultimedia\nVideos\n\n\n\nCream Careers\nCareers\n\n\n\nWheels\nWheels\nSearch\nSell Your Vehicle\nDealers\nWheels News\nWheels Video\n\n\n\n\n\nNewspaper\nToday's E-Paper\nClassifieds\nCirculation\nHerald in Education Program\nBecome a Chronicle Herald Retailer\nSubscribe\nBusiness Insider Signup\n\n\n\nAbout the Herald\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nCareer Opportunities\nF.A.Q\nLibrary Services\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising\nHerald Media Kit\nAd Specs\nLocal Businesses\nPay Your Account\n\n\n\nClients\nPrint Upload\nReal Estate Portal\nAd Specs\n\n\n\nFun & Games\nCrossword\nSudoku\nContests\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful Information\nHerald Shop\nMobile Apps\nWeekly Flyers\nN.S.

The federal government has announced the terms of a long-awaited inquiry into murdered and missing indigenous women, unveiling that it will need at least $13.8 million more for the study than was originally expected. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\tGATINEAU, Que. - A long-standing call for an inquiry into the disproportionate number of missing and murdered indigenous women across the country was answered Wednesday, but family members and advocates said they felt vulnerable about the process and wondered if it will result in real action.\n\n\tIn a ceremony at the Canadian Museum of History which included indigenous traditions, Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and Status of Women Minister Patty Hajdu handed over a symbolic birchbark basket to the five commissioners who will study the issue.\n\n\tThe Native Women's Association of Canada, along with other organizations including the Assembly of First Nations, have been pushing for the inquiry to examine the magnitude of the problem.\n\n\tTo date, the only formal figures available are from the RCMP.\n\n\tIn May 2014, it documented 1,181 cases of murdered and missing women between 1980 and 2012.\n\n\tA year later, it released updated figures, noting 32 more aboriginal women had been murdered and 11 more had disappeared since its initial report.\n\n\tThere's also the basic issue of violence against women \u2014 both inside indigenous communities and in urban centres.\n\n\tThe enormity of the situation was visible on Wilson-Raybould's face Wednesday, as she fought back tears.\n\n\tAs a former B.C. regional chief for the Assembly of First Nations, she has an intimate knowledge of the problem.\n\n\t\"For me this morning, it kind of all came flooding in,\" Wilson-Raybould said in an interview with The Canadian Press.\n\n\t\"I mean, this is really important. I thought about all of the women that were looking at us in the audience today and across the country that are invested in this inquiry, want to find the truth, want to bring justice to their loved ones.\"\n\n\tBridget Tolley from the Kitigan Zibi reserve near Maniwaki, Que., said she has searched for answers for 15 years.\n\n\tShe alleges her mother was struck by a provincial police officer but said there was no investigation to examine what happened.\n\n\t\"It hurts,\" Tolley said, with tears streaming down her face.\n\n\t\"I want justice so badly ... I am just hoping and praying this helps some families, if not mine. That's all.\"\n\n\tCharlie Angus, the NDP's indigenous affairs critic, said Wednesday's announcement was a long time coming and he supports the work of he commissioners.\n\n\tBut he said one of his greatest concerns is that the federal government raised expectations for families.\n\n\t\"Many of these families, they want to know who killed their daughter or sister and the minister ... raised enormous expectations in the families of these victims when they started to speculate publicly about the numbers,\" Angus said.\n\n\tFive commissioners, to be led by Marion Buller, B.C.'s first female First Nations judge, will hear many stories like Tolley's and will have to present recommendations for action.\n\n\tThe federal government has provided $53.8 million to the commission for its work over the next two years, $13.8 million more than originally budgeted.\n\n\tThe commission is empowered to compel witnesses to testify, as a court is.\n\n\tBennett stressed, however, the government has heard many families are not interested in courtroom drama.

(Photo: Richard Lautens/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanada\u2019s federal government announced Wednesday that it will finally launch a long-awaited inquiry into the country\u2019s murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls.\nAl Jazeera reports:\nCanadian Minister of Indigenous Affairs Carolyn Bennett said a national, independent commission would begin [its inquiry] on September 1.\nBennett said the commission would have the \u201chistoric\u201d ability to gather information across Canada and she thanked the indigenous families that have already shared their experiences.\n\u201cIt\u2019s because of these courageous women and families, who knew something was very wrong, that we are here today,\u201d Bennett said during a press conference at the Canadian Museum of History near Ottawa.\n\u201cThey knew an inquiry was needed to achieve justice and healing and to put an end to this ongoing terrible tragedy.\u201d\nRights groups have long called for such an inquiry, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau campaigned on a promise to establish one.\nAmnesty International has called [pdf] the thousands of murders and abductions a \u201cnational human rights crisis,\u201d and Human Rights Watch reported on the scope of the violence last year:\nIndigenous women and girls in Canada are murdered at almost four times the rate of other women and girls in Canada. In 2014, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police identified 1,181 cases of murders and disappearances of indigenous women and girls between 1980 and 2012, double the previous estimates. In 2013 Human Rights Watch issued a report on police treatment of indigenous women in northern British Columbia that documented not only police failures to protect indigenous women from violence, but also police abuse of these women and girls.\n\u201cWhen police abuse happens or when the police fail to provide adequate protection, women, girls, and their families have limited recourse,\u201d  said Liesl Gerntholtz, women\u2019s rights director at Human Rights Watch, in 2014. \u201cThe gravity of the crisis of violence against indigenous women in Canada\u00a0demands a national inquiry.\u201d\nAdvocacy group the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada (NWAC) noted that it has been calling for such an inquiry for over a decade as it praised the latest news.\n\u201cWe welcome the leadership shown by the federal government today. After 11 years of NWAC listening to the families of the missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada, we are pleased that we now have a government who is prepared to listen and act,\u201d the organization\u2019s president wrote in a statement.\nAl Jazeera writes that \u201cMarion Buller, the first female First Nations judge in British Columbia, will head up the five-person commission, which is tasked with examining the root causes of the violence, including racism, sexism and Canadian colonialism.\u201d\nThe news outlet continues:\nThe commissioners will have the power to compel individuals to give evidence, including police officers, and gather documents, Bennett said. The inquiry will be able to issue recommendations that are non-binding.\n\u201cOur goal is to make concrete recommendations that will ensure the safety of our women and our girls in our communities,\u201d said Buller, the chief commissioner.\nThe commission will begin its inquiry on September 1 and says it will issue a final report and recommendations based on its findings by December 2018.\nWhile welcoming the long-awaited inquiry, many Indigenous rights advocates also expressed concerns about adequacy of the investigation\u2019s scope.\nFor example, NWAC observed that in the official description of the inquiry, \u201c[t]here is no mention of the role of the provinces and territories and yet we know that some of the systemic issues will require provincial discussions, namely police services and the child welfare system.\u201d\n\u201cWe cannot ignore what we know,\u201d the group adds. \u201cGirls have described that they were sex trafficked from group homes and motels that are part of the child welfare system. We have a disproportionate number of Indigenous people who are in the criminal justice system. These issues are all interrelated and our expectation is that one reason we are having the inquiry [is] to address how these issues relate to violence against Indigenous women and girls.\u201d\nIndeed, there is tremendous distrust of police and government forces in Indigenous communities, as the police for decades abducted Indigenous children and forced them into the abusive residential school system.\nAlex Neve, executive director of Amnesty International Canada, told\u00a0Al Jazeera\u00a0that \u201cthere are still doubts, uncertainty and concern\u201d about the extent to which the inquiry will be able to investigate Canada\u2019s federal and provincial justice systems and police forces.\nThese issues \u201care particularly preoccupying as they go to the very fundamentals of what this inquiry must address,\u201d Neve told the outlet.\n###\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License\nSource: http://www.commondreams.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments comments \n\n\n\nTags:Amnesty InternationalCanadahuman interesthuman rightsindigenous peopleinternational newsmurder\n\n\n\nPrevious : Setback for Equality: Supreme Court Blocks Transgender Teen\u2019s Bathroom Access \n\nNext : Jeremy Corbyn Launches Bold Progressive Vision to Transform UK \n\n\n\nAbout The Author\n\n\n\n\n\nStaff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated posts\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWhat is Donald Trump\u2019s Connection to Vladimir Putin?

Specific outcomes include the commitment to gather again in 2016 to assess progress.\u00a0The National Roundtable is a result of support expressed by Premiers at a meeting with National Aboriginal Organizations in August 2014.Highlights:Three priority areas were the focus of roundtable discussion and delegates agreed to coordinate efforts toward tangible and immediate action in each.\u00a0Prevention and AwarenessRaising public awareness aimed at changing attitudes that devalue Indigenous women and girls and the contributions of Indigenous Peoples as an educational tool for violence prevention.\u00a0\u00a0Reducing the marginalization of Indigenous women and girls by improving socio-economic development and outcomes.Improving prevention and responses to violence within intimate relationships and families.\u00a0Community SafetySupporting Indigenous communities, organizations and individuals to develop safety initiatives that respond to their unique cultural, traditional and socio-economic needs and realities.Engaging communities, governments, organizations and institutions, in supporting prevention, action, and intervention when violence has occurred.Supporting and addressing safety and healing of individuals, families and communities.\u00a0Policing Measures and Justice ResponsesImproving the relationship between justice sector professionals, including police, and Indigenous Peoples and strengthening community-based policing in Indigenous communities.Identifying strategies within the justice system to protect and assist Indigenous women and girls who are victims of violence.\u00a0Outcomes and Next Steps:Delegates of the National Roundtable commit to continuing to work together in coordinating action to prevent and end violence against Indigenous women and girls, including the commitment to a second National Roundtable to be held in 2016.\u00a0 All Parties committed to working directly with Indigenous communities and organizations to move forward on Roundtable commitments to discuss efforts underway, progress and areas for further focus.\u00a0 Parties to the National Roundtable commit to using their respective reporting and accountability mechanisms to report on their activities and progress and will increase efforts at enhanced public reporting, and sharing information on effective collaboration efforts both within and across jurisdictions, organizations and communities.\u00a0Parties to the National Roundtable further committed to the development of a prevention and awareness campaign and accepted an invitation from the Province of Manitoba to host an inaugural forum to explore best practices and better coordinate and share information on policing and justice responses.\u00a0Quotes:Ceremonial Family Witness Judy Maas from Blueberry River First Nation:\u00a0 \"We will idle no more as our sisters, mothers, daughters, aunties, and grandmothers go missing and continue to be violated by any type of violence.\u00a0 We will no longer remain invisible.\u00a0 We will take our rightful place.\u00a0 Our voices are the voices of those who have suffered.\u00a0 Our children deserve better. We expect nothing less than a formal commitment by governments to implement the recommendations being heard.\"Minister of Labour and Minister of Status of Women Dr. K. Kellie Leitch, P.C., O.Ont., M.P.:\u00a0 \"Our Government understands the heavy toll that violence has on victims, families, and communities. That's why we are committed to taking concrete actions that address family violence and violent crimes against Aboriginal women and girls. And because everyone has a role to play, the Government of Canada will continue working collaboratively with provinces and territories, Aboriginal families, communities and organizations, to address this important issue.\"\u00a0Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Bernard Valcourt:\u00a0 \"Our Government recognizes that addressing violence against Aboriginal women is a shared responsibility that requires commitment to action from all partners, including at the community level. By meeting today and continuing to work together, we are sending a strong message that these abhorrent acts of violence will not be tolerated.\"Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde: \"I commend the strength of the families of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and the leadership of Indigenous organizations, provinces, territories and the federal government for coming together for this unprecedented gathering.\u00a0 Ending violence must be a national priority and we must work together to ensure to uphold the fundamental right to life and security for every Indigenous woman and girl and to live free of discrimination. \u00a0The commitments we made today must translate into action on the ground to keep Indigenous women and girls safe and secure.\u00a0 We will continue to work with Indigenous families, organizations and all levels of governments to end violence and we will continue the push for a National Public Inquiry to seek justice and to move on long-term solutions.\"Congress of Aboriginal Peoples National Chief Betty Ann Lavall\u00e9e: \"This meeting was a constructive step forward, but there is much more to do.\u00a0 The spirits of our sisters will not rest until justice is done and neither will we.\"Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami President Terry Audla: \"There is no one-size-fits all approach to addressing some of the significant issues we have been wrestling with today. Inuit welcome the commitments reached at this meeting and look forward to working with provincial, territorial and federal governments to develop specific means of addressing our most pressing needs, respecting the fact that violence has a human cost, and it also has an economic cost. Inuit live in some of the most remote communities in Canada, and the delivery of and access to programs and services in our homeland will always cost more than it does to provide those same programs and services in Southern Canada.\"M\u00e9tis National Council President Cl\u00e9ment Chartier: M\u00e9tis National Council President Cl\u00e9ment Chartier: \"The M\u00e9tis Nation is pleased to witness the forward movement on addressing this most critical matter. \u00a0The issue of murdered and missing Aboriginal women and girls has been plaguing our communities for far too long and concrete solutions must be explored and implemented. \u00a0I congratulate the leadership of both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal governments and organizations for taking this progressive step and thank the affected families for their continued determination to seek the justice this violation of life is demanding.\"Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak / Women of the M\u00e9tis Nation President Melanie Omeniho: \"I acknowledge the work that has been achieved by bringing together the National Aboriginal Organizations, provinces, territories, \u00a0the federal government and representatives from the families of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women for this unique meeting. The life, safety and security of Indigenous women, which includes Metis women is a priority for Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak. It is an exceptional opportunity to work with other Aboriginal representative organizations and the various levels of government to build on a collective action plan that will assist us in addressing the overwhelming issues that result from the level of violence that some Indigenous women have been a victim of.\"Native Women's Association of Canada Interim Action President Dr. Dawn Harvard: \"We must work together \u2013 Aboriginal Peoples and all levels Governments to put in place measures that protect Aboriginal women and girls. Anything less is a denial of our basic human rights. The provinces and territories and Aboriginal Peoples have all supported the call for a national public inquiry and now we need to work together, along with the Federal Government to implement a comprehensive, national framework of action to end violence!\"Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada President Rebecca Kudloo: \"We know that Inuit women and children are at the greatest risk of violence in their homes and our members feel prevention is the most important and urgent issue to be addressed after this roundtable. They have told us that unresolved trauma and abuse is the most significant underlying cause to be addressed, and we look forward to a whole-of-government response in working together to address this major physical and mental health issue.\"Alberta Legislative Secretary for Aboriginal Education and Jobs, Skills, and Training Pearl Calahasen: \"The discussions we had at today's national roundtable were incredibly valuable. The Alberta government remains committed to taking action on the issue of missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls by continuing its work with Aboriginal leaders, communities and organizations to find solutions. \"British Columbia Minister of Aboriginal Relations and Reconciliation John Rustad:\u00a0 \"This significant gathering has resulted in a level of discussion never seen before and I thank the family members of missing and murdered Aboriginal women who dedicated their time and displayed great courage telling their stories. The B.C. government has taken action on all major themes from our provincial Missing Women Commission of Inquiry and we will continue to work with our Aboriginal partners on the systemic changes needed to create a legacy of safety for Aboriginal women and girls. This work, and our efforts nationwide, will be enriched by today's dialogue.\"Manitoba Premier Gregory Selinger: \"This roundtable is about the families from across the country who have suffered an unimaginable and tragic loss.\u00a0 Mothers, daughter, sisters and wives have been taken from them and their families are left behind to pick up the pieces. For some families, they have the heartbreaking task of caring for children who will never see their mothers again.\u00a0 This gathering helps us to move forward on addressing the critical issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada.\"New Brunswick Minister Responsible for the Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat Dr. Ed. Doherty M.D.: \"Violence against Aboriginal women and girls impacts Aboriginal communities and families throughout New Brunswick. We are pleased to have this opportunity to work together and stimulate discussion and collaboration in addressing violence against aboriginal women and girls not only in New Brunswick, but across the country\". \u00a0Newfoundland and Labrador Minister of Justice and Public Safety and Attorney General Judy Manning: \"In 2014, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador supported a provincial, all-party resolution calling for a national inquiry into missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls. We are prepared to work with the Government of Canada on such an initiative and committed to cooperating with all jurisdictions to eliminate all forms of violence against Aboriginal women and girls. We acknowledge those families and individuals that attended the Family and Peoples Gatherings, and we thank them for having the courage to share their stories.\"Northwest Territories Premier Bob Mcleod: \"Our experience in the Northwest Territories is that we are stronger and more successful when we work together as partners. This has been at the foundation of our commitment to engage with Aboriginal governments and organizations in the spirit of respect, recognition and responsibility.

I am proud that Ontario has joined leaders across Canada to ensure that Aboriginal women and girls can live safely and reach their full potential.\"Prince Edward Island Minister of Community Services and Seniors and Minister\u00a0Responsible for the Status of Women Valerie E. Docherty:\u00a0 \"Now is the time to take action\u00a0and address the crisis of the\u00a0disproportionate number of indigenous women and girls who are missing or murdered in Canada. By working together\u00a0respectfully we\u00a0can improve the lives of Indigenous women, girls and their families. I am hopeful that the work accomplished today will initiate collaborative efforts from all levels of government and Aboriginal organizations that will result in achievable action items.\"Quebec Minister responsible for Native Affairs Geoffrey Kelley, and Minister of Justice Ms. St\u00e9phanie Vall\u00e9e:\u00a0 \"In August 2014, during the meetings of the Council of the Federation, the Government of Quebec supported the proposal by First Nations members that a national roundtable be created to study the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women.\u00a0 We are already working on the wide variety of issues that arise from violence against Indigenous women with First Nations organizations in Qu\u00e9bec, but we know that we can always do more.\u00a0 Our presence here today is a reflection of our willingness to collaborate with the other provinces as well as the federal government to share our resources and our experiences so as to end violence against Indigenous women and girls.\"Saskatchewan Minister of Justice and Attorney General Gordon Wyant:\u00a0 \"I'm proud of the services offered in Saskatchewan to help address violence against Aboriginal women and girls, as well as initiatives geared towards prevention and awareness.

I also want to acknowledge the strength and resilience of the family members who attended the roundtable, and the determination of everyone here to create communities where Aboriginal women and girls are safe.\"NATIONAL ROUNDTABLE ON MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN AND GIRLSFRAMEWORK FOR ACTION TO PREVENT AND ADDRESS VIOLENCE AGAINST INDIGENOUS WOMEN AND GIRLSINTRODUCTION AND PURPOSEThe goals of the National Roundtable are to:Create a dialogue with all levels of government, Indigenous[1] representatives and families to effectively address the crisis of violence against Indigenous women and girls.Identify solutions and collaborative means of moving them forward, including the ongoing engagement of Indigenous Peoples, families and communities in reducing and eliminating all forms of violence.The National Roundtable brings together federal, provincial and territorial governments in partnership with National Aboriginal Organizations (NAOs) to discuss how best to collaborate and coordinate action to prevent and address violence against Indigenous women and girls, including those cases that result in their murder or disappearance.\u00a0 As noted in the 2014 Federal Action Plan to Address Family Violence and Violent Crimes Against Aboriginal Women and Girls \"\u2026no organization or level of government alone can eradicate this violence.\u00a0 This work must be done in partnership across federal organizations, with provinces and territories and through the leadership of Aboriginal communities and organizations.\"All Indigenous women and children have an equal right to live free of violence and all forms of discrimination. \u00a0In recent years, there have been a number of initiatives aimed at responding to the prevalence of violence against Indigenous women and girls, including the disproportionate rates of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada. \u00a0A variety of responses and actions have been developed by communities and governments, including provincial, territorial, federal and Indigenous governments, however no comprehensive and coordinated response exists.\u00a0 Such a response would bring broader attention, education and focus to prevention and immediate solutions, while enabling local flexibility and decision-making.To move this dialogue forward and initiate coordinated action, the following three priority areas have been identified for discussion at the National Roundtable to address the disproportionate number of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls:Prevention and AwarenessCommunity SafetyPolicing Measures and Justice Responses\u00a0PRINCIPLESThere is consensus that additional action must be taken now and increased efforts need to be made to assess our progress while ensuring that everything possible is being done for the safety and security of Indigenous women and girls. The National Roundtable presents a unique opportunity for federal, provincial and territorial governments to come together with NAOs and representatives from the families of murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls to move on coordinated actions, prevention and solutions.It is anticipated that the National Roundtable will result in commitments to prevent, reduce and eliminate violence against Indigenous women and girls, focusing on the three priority areas. \u00a0Parties to the National Roundtable believe an important foundation for this Framework is agreement on a set of common principles that guide how the Parties work together to prevent and address violence against Indigenous women and girls. \u00a0Parties to the National Roundtable endorse the following principles:Human Rights: Violence against Indigenous women and girls implicates numerous human rights including the right to life, to security, to equality and to be free of discrimination.Shared responsibility: Preventing and addressing violence against Indigenous women and children is a shared responsibility, requiring shared commitments across governments and communities.Community-based solutions:\u00a0 Solutions to prevent and end violence against Indigenous women and girls must be community-based and led, recognizing the diversity of community situations, and appropriate support given to building community capacity.A focus on healing: Addressing violence against Indigenous women and children acknowledges the need for improved relationships based on respect and understanding among Indigenous Peoples and non-Indigenous Canadians, and the need for holistic approaches in concert with support for the healing of individuals and communities.A collaborative focus: Indigenous Peoples must be partners in developing and implementing responses to addressing violence against Indigenous women and girls.Bringing about behavioral change: Addressing and preventing violence against Indigenous women and girls requires a shift in societal attitudes and behaviours, within individuals, institutions and organizations, including men and boys, who are key agents of that change.Changing the discourse: Mobilizing Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities to change how we talk about the issues can help re-frame institutional responses, community perspectives and individual attitudes.These principles underlie recent work as noted in the reports cited in this Framework document that have identified paths forward in developing community-based approaches to ending violence against Indigenous women and girls.\u00a0PATHWAYS FORWARDAs a result of the National Roundtable, each federal, provincial and territorial government and each NAO will coordinate efforts toward tangible and immediate actions in each of the priority areas. \u00a0Together this will constitute a shared national commitment to increased, ongoing collaboration with the development of regionally and community-based and community-driven solutions to prevent and address violence against Indigenous women and girls.Parties to the National Roundtable have agreed to improve coordination and collaboration across sectors, and amongst each other, along the following high-level pathways, recognizing these areas are fundamentally interconnected and must not be viewed in isolation.Discussion continues among Parties to the National Roundtable on specific examples of how these pathways can be implemented.\u00a0 Means and processes for implementation will vary based on relationships and priorities among Indigenous communities and organizations and provincial, territorial and federal governments.Prevention and AwarenessRaising public awareness aimed at changing attitudes that devalue Indigenous women and girls and the contributions of Indigenous Peoples as an educational tool for violence prevention.\u00a0 \u00a0Reducing the marginalization of Indigenous women and girls by improving socio-economic development and outcomes.Improving prevention and responses to violence within intimate relationships and families.Community SafetySupporting Indigenous communities, organizations and individuals to develop safety initiatives that respond to their unique cultural, traditional and socio-economic needs and realities.Engaging communities, governments, organizations and institutions, in supporting prevention, action, and intervention when violence has occurred.Supporting and addressing safety and healing of individuals, families and communities.\u00a0Policing Measures and Justice ResponsesImproving the relationship between justice sector professionals, including police, and Indigenous Peoples and strengthening community-based policing in Indigenous communities.Identifying strategies within the justice system to protect and assist Indigenous women and girls who are victims of violence.FOLLOW-UP AND SHARING OF OUTCOMES\u00a0All Parties to the National Roundtable commit to continuing to work together in coordinating action to prevent and end violence against Indigenous women and girls.\u00a0 To further solidify these efforts a 2nd National Roundtable will be held by the end of 2016 to discuss progress and continue dialogue on efforts underway and areas for further focus.\u00a0 All Parties commit to work directly with Indigenous communities and organizations to move forward on these priorities and in preparation for the 2nd National Roundtable.Public accountability is paramount to the continued progress in addressing violence against Indigenous women and girls, including the tragedy of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\u00a0 Accordingly, Parties to the National Roundtable commit to using their respective reporting and accountability mechanisms to report on their activities and progress and will increase efforts at enhanced public reporting, and sharing information on effective collaboration efforts both within and across jurisdictions, organizations and communities.\u00a0\u00a0BACKGROUND/CONTEXTIt is well understood there are complex and long-standing underlying issues that have brought us to where we are today in respect of the disproportionate levels of violence against Indigenous women and girls which perpetuate this critical situation.\u00a0 Indigenous women and girls are three times more likely to experience violence than non-Indigenous women and this violence results in more serious harm.\u00a0 In May 2014, the RCMP released a National Operational Overview on Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women.\u00a0 The research identified 1,181 missing and murdered Aboriginal women in Canadian police databases between 1980 and 2012; of those \u00a01,017 were murdered, and there are 164 investigations of missing Aboriginal women dating back to 1952.\u00a0Indigenous Peoples are not a homogeneous group culturally, traditionally or geographically.\u00a0 Diversity and distinctions exist between and within First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis Peoples based on a number of factors including language, cultural beliefs, social structures, geography, governance structures and the existence of Treaties and other agreements with the Crown in some areas. This means effective solutions must be community-based and community-driven. In recognition of this diversity and differences in documented outcomes for various First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis Peoples, special attention needs to be given to the development of responses that reflect these differences.\u00a0 Additionally, the varying needs and perspectives of women, youth, Elders, urban, northern and remote populations must also be taken into account.The safety and well-being of Indigenous women and girls is integral to ensuring healthy and prosperous Indigenous families, communities and nations within Canada. There is no more important role for governments or the state than protecting citizens. Equally, there is no more important role for families or communities than keeping each other safe and promoting safety.\u00a0Numerous reports, forums and inquiries have brought attention to this issue, including the seminal Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1996), the Manitoba Aboriginal Justice Inquiry, (1999), Amnesty International's Stolen Sisters Report (2004), the BC Missing Women Commission of Inquiry (2012), the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights report on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in British Columbia, Canada (2014) and each of the reports from the National Aboriginal Women's Summits 2007-2014.Jurisdictions and Indigenous communities have responded with a range of activities.\u00a0\u00a0 Additionally, there are a number of cross-jurisdictional efforts underway to address violence against Aboriginal women and girls in Canada. Frameworks have been developed by the Aboriginal Affairs Ministers and National Aboriginal Leaders Working Group (Framework for Coordinating Action to End Violence Against Aboriginal Women and Girls), the Federal/Provincial/Territorial (FPT) Ministers of Justice and Public Safety (Draft Justice Framework to Address Violence Against Aboriginal Women and Girls) and the FPT Forum of Ministers Responsible for the Status of Women endorsed the Iqaluit Declaration in 2007 to address violence against Aboriginal women.Federally, a Special Parliamentary Committee on Violence Against Indigenous Women and Girls released its report Invisible Women: A Call to Action \u2013 A Report on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in Canada in March 2014.\u00a0 The Government of Canada provided a response to this report in September 2014 in the 2014 Federal Action Plan to Address Family Violence and Violent Crimes Against Aboriginal Women and Girls.\u00a0[1] Indigenous refers to Inuit, M\u00e9tis and First Nations peoples in Canada. Parties to the National Roundtable acknowledge specific needs that arise as a result of urban/rural/northern and on/off reserve-based considerations, Inuit Nunangat considerations, the application of the Indian Act, and gender issues.\u00a0Society & CultureCultural Groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to view comments\n\n\ue048\nView Comments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\ue071\ue000\ue001\ue07d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMust Watch\n   What to read next              Play   Yahoo Finance's cocktail of the week: The soft landing         J.C.

These pages were cut by M&S from the first edition for fear that the RCMP would retaliate or halt publication.\nIn the context of the ongoing Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two-Spirit genocide in Canada, as well as the long history of the RCMP\u2019s so-called starlight tours \u2013 a practice in which police drive Indigenous people outside of city limits to abandon them on roads and highways \u2013 and other violences, and the continued injustice in the court system for the families of Indigenous youths Tina Fontaine, Colten Boushie, and others, Halfbreed\u2019s re-release is timely and needed.\nWhen I polled Indigenous readers on Twitter as to what they would like to ask Campbell, CBC Vancouver reporter Angela Sterritt (Gitxsan/Amsiwa) wrote: \u201cNothing I\u2019d just stare in aw[e] and praise her.\u201d Sterritt\u2019s tweet should give some context about Campbell\u2019s distinguished status as she enters her 80th year.\nJenny Ferguson: Tanisi, Maria. It\u2019s an honour to speak with you. To position myself, my father\u2019s ancestry is M\u00e9tis and white, and my mother is white. I\u2019m trying to reclaim my M\u00e9tis roots and my first time reading Halfbreed was both a pleasure and an experience in sitting in \u2013 and actively feeling \u2013 my own colonization.\nI\u2019m wondering how you think the new generation of Indigenous readers will engage with Halfbreed, a book about M\u00e9tis life, written not by anthropologists but by an Indigenous woman?\nMaria Campbell: It\u2019s a new generation but colonial Canada is not long ago \u2013 it\u2019s today. Some people might say it\u2019s not as bad \u2013 because I\u2019ve thought that \u2013 but it\u2019s not easy when you are trying to comfort a mom who\u2019s just lost a child to suicide or murder or child services or any number of things our people are up against. We have the highest number of kids in care [in Canada], more than we ever had in residential school. Do you think those children are not being abused?\nIndigenous people account for the highest suicide rates in the country. There are all of our missing and murdered people, not just women. No drinking water, little or no food for lots of children. This is Canada. I\u2019m sorry, I know identity is important for many people today, but identity is just a small drop in the bucket for most of our babies. They know that who they are is why they are poor and invisible.\nI do hope that after reading it there will be many conversations and more questions asked. Not just about how bad things are right now, but about history and diversity by all readers, including Indigenous people.\nMost people know little about Michif or halfbreeds, even less about \u201croad allowance people.\u201d We get lost in all the categories and statuses created by government policy and courts, which cause confusion. But that\u2019s what it is meant to do and we need to talk about that.\nI hope that we, Indigenous people, talk about our kinship to each other and why there is so much animosity between us and where that comes from. I wrote about it in the first edition and I left it in. I didn\u2019t change anything, most of it I didn\u2019t want to change because that was where I was at back then. Now I am not there anymore, but those prejudices and bitter feelings are still prevalent in our community and we have to ask why, if we are going to heal.\nI also would like a conversation about why I do not consider myself a part of the #MeToo generation.\nJF: I\u2019d love to hear more about this, if you\u2019re willing to share.\nMC: I, in no way, am disrespecting the #MeToo movement. I honour and am grateful for each and every woman who comes forward and continues to come forward. She makes it safe for all women. But I don\u2019t want what happened to me and to other Indigenous women to get lost [in discussions about] sexual violence and harassment because it is bigger than that. It is about 600 years of misogynistic, colonial history. The taking and the raping of our homelands began with the raping, brutality, death, and dispossession of Indigenous women and children. That is where no one wants to go. But those are conversations we must have.\nJF: That\u2019s what I go to books for: a way of seeing/knowing that I didn\u2019t have before. And that\u2019s what you\u2019ve given me here. Reading books in which the truth of the full experience living as a Native person in colonial Canada is detailed is something, I believe, too few of us have had the chance to experience. Are there other recent or forthcoming Indigenous memoirs you would recommend we read alongside this new edition of Halfbreed?\nMaria Campbell (Dave Stobbe)\nMC: I think you/we should read all of them. My old mentor, to illustrate a point, once lifted a puzzle my children had finished putting together and tossed it in the air. It broke up in hundreds of pieces. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s what happened to us \u2013 to our history, our culture, our lives \u2013 when each one of us has one or two or six pieces. If we put them together, we can rebuild.\u201d\nIf you read my book, you get a few pieces of the story, but if you read the other books, listen to the songs, hear a fiddle tune, listen to a drum group, watch a dance, take part in a ceremony, join in a prayer, the tears and laughter, all will open the door to a \u201cwhole\u201d story. It\u2019s easy for my story alone to give you a stereotype, especially when as colonized humans we are prone to them.\nJF:\u00a0 \u201cThey make you hate what you are.\u201d This phrase is attributed to your grandmother, Cheechum, who lived until she was 104. She has the kind of perspective I can\u2019t imagine in my mid-30s, but one that I admire.\nTo me, Halfbreed is about how racist systems at work in colonial Canada teach Indigenous peoples to hate who and what they are. But it\u2019s also about learning how to shed that hate. How to remove the blanket you\u2019ve been handed to cover a shame that\u2019s been ingrained in you because of who you are.\nSome Indigenous and mixed-Indigenous people I\u2019ve talked to very much struggle with claiming the term \u201chalfbreed.\u201d Though in your memoir, this term is \u201calmost like happiness, pride and hurt all at once.\u201d Can you speak about the dichotomy between hating who and what you are and the desire to label yourself?\nMC: I keep hearing and seeing those words \u201chated herself and her people, hated who she was,\u201d and I can\u2019t relate to them because I never hated being a halfbreed. Or at least I never felt that inside. But I hated what it represented, how it was represented. I hated the poverty, shame, worthlessness. I hated being invisible and at the same time so visible. I hated how it paralyzed us and wounded our souls and still does. I was and still am often angry although I have learned to use that anger in a more gentle way.\nAbout reconciliation, there is no such thing. We can\u2019t go back to a good time to begin again because there never was a \u201cgood\u201d time. But conciliation \u2013 kwaysk astaswin \u2013 to put things right. I can do that if someone is willing to work with me. I love my babies and I want a better world for them.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Jenny Ferguson\nIssue Date: October 2019\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\nLEAVE A REPLY\nSend feedback to Q&Q editors about this Author Profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJob Board\n\n\n\n\nOffice Manager / Bookkeeper\nWindsor \n\n\n\n\nPublicity Assistant\nToronto \n\n\n\n\nSales, Marketing, and Distribution Manager\nToronto \n\n\n\n\n\nView All\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nLatest Issue \nSubscribe: Digital Edition\nSubscribe: Print Edition\nBuy Back Issues\nManage Magazine Subscription\n\n\nContact Us \nUse our anonymous tipline\nReport a book deal\nContact us via email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\nHome\nQuillblog\nBook reviews\nChildren\u2019s book reviews\nAuthor Profiles\nJob Board\nInternships\n \n\nQ&Q Omni\nIndustry News\nPersonnel changes\nAwards\nAnonymous tipline\n \n\nCustomer Service\nPublications\nSubscribe to Q&Q magazine\nManage my Digital Subscription\nFAQ\nAdvertising Info\nAbout Us\nPrivacy Policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll content copyright Quill & Quire \u2014 Quill & Quire is a registered trademark of St. Joseph Media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Her body was put in a sleeping bag and left in a crawl space.\nHarlick said she worries about the day when the man convicted of her mother's second-degree murder is released.\n\"I don't like feeling scared. I shouldn't have to feel scared,\" she said.\n\"When I get these feelings of being scared I feel like I'm going to be just another statistic. That's something that worries me all the time because I don't want to be another statistic,\"\u00a0Harlick said.\nAnother witness,\u00a0Sylvia Murphy,\u00a0told the inquiry how she and seven siblings were abandoned by their mother and sent to an orphanage that later closed.\nMurphy said they then found themselves in a series of foster homes where she and her sister\u00a0were abused as\u00a0young girls.\nShe said her sister was sexually assaulted on a regular basis and was told not to tell anyone.\nMurphy\u00a0said they eventually went to police and gave statements, but\u00a0investigators said charges could not be laid.\n\"There has been no justice for us all this time. When that investigator came back and said, we cannot charge them, I felt my whole world fell,\" she said.\nMurphy also told the inquiry that the federal government is revoking her Indigenous status as a Mi'kmaq, claiming she doesn't meet the requirements even though she has provided ancestry information.\nThe issue of women losing status has been a common story across the country as a result of changing circumstances including marrying a non-Indigenous man.\u00a0\nRutie Lampe spoke about the death of her daughter, Kimberley Jararuse, who was just 20 when she was killed in an abusive relationship.\u00a0\n\"She didn't get a chance to live her life,\" Lampe said.\nShe said there needs to be more safe houses where abused women can seek refuge, and more\u00a0healing sessions for families, even years after suffering the loss of someone to violence.\nThe Labrador hearings concluded with emotional testimony from Benigna Anderson of Nain\u00a0who got into an abusive relationship at the age of 15 with a man who was seven years older.\nShe\u00a0spoke of being severely beaten many times, often in front of others who did nothing to\u00a0intervene.\nAnderson was with the man for quite a few years, having six of his children, while he continued to drink and beat her.\nShe said police intervened many times, and he was put in custody\u00a0\u2014 each time returning to start the cycle again.\u00a0\n\"Each time his sentence was reduced because he was aboriginal. I believe this is the number one reason violence is so prevalent in aboriginal communities. People literally get away with murder,\" she said.\nAnderson\u00a0called on the inquiry to recommend better resources for abused women, and said there needs to be a change in attitude\u00a0by police.\n\"There is a systematic disrespect for aboriginal people,\" she said. \u00a0\nAt the start of Thursday's hearing, Johannes Lampe, president of Nunatsiavut Assembly, read a list of missing and murdered women from Labrador.\n\"It is my hope that the concerns of Labrador Inuit will be heard loud and clear by the inquiry commissioners and that those concerns will be given full consideration in the inquiry's final report,\" he said.\n\"In the end we all want justice.

It\u2019s not limited to Islamic countries. It happens in countries that have overall good human rights records, and yet it still happens and it can still be very widespread.\u201dThe reports from international human rights groups have included recommendations on how police handle investigations involving missing or murdered indigenous women, and also on how to deal with allegations of police misconduct.The terms of reference for the inquiry give the commissioners broad powers to compel witnesses and summon evidence, including in provincial and territorial jurisdictions such as policing. They do not, however, mention police explicitly \u2014 an omission that has been a point of contention for family members and critics.\u201cI think it is entirely legitimate for everyone to be asking that question, because we have seen processes gone forward on this topic before that did not deal with those (issues),\u201d said Rhoad, whose organization issued a 2013 report on the role of policing in missing and murdered indigenous women in northern B.C.She said the report from the UN committee, for example, pointed out that the recommendations in the 2014 report of the House of Commons special committee on violence against women did not include anything on police misconduct.Craig Benjamin, of Amnesty International Canada, said it remains to be seen whether the inquiry is equipped to address the concerns raised by international groups.\u201cIt\u2019s significant that the government has been clear from the outset that the intention is to get at the root causes, and to move forward with a comprehensive response,\u201d Benjamin said.That has been central to what the international human rights bodies have asked for, he added.\u201cHow well the inquiry can actually serve that purpose is going to depend to a large degree on the co-operation that it receives from the provincial and territorial governments, from policing services \u2014 and questions remain about that.\u201dThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star & PartnersLOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a031\u00b0CloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto cops respond to gun call, find Terminator mannequinThe caller reported that she was taking out the trash behind her building when she located the suspect who she described as white, with a bloody face, standing at 6\u20192\u201d tall, in his 20s, and was wearing a black jacket.NewsGTACity HallQueen\u2019s ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion & StyleFood & WineHealth & WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReader's LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot Topics:MMIWRio OlympicsU.S. ElectionPokemon GoBlue JaysGeneration 9/11Panama PapersFresh Air FundWeather BlogFollow us:FacebookTwitterGoogle+InstagramRSSManage NewslettersSite MapAboutContact UsFeedbackthestar.comFeedbackSite MapNewslettersInsurance HotlineNew in HomesStar StoreCorrectionsBehavioural TargetingToday's NewsFlyersCanadaStaysContestsToronto Star Newspaper\u00a0Ltd.AboutAtkinson PrinciplesStatement of PrinciplesGet Home DeliveryMy SubscriptionContact UsContact WebmasterFAQNews ReleasesStar InternshipsCareers @ the StarStar AdvisersStar ePaperStar TouchAdvertise with UsAdvertising TermsMedia KitSpecial FeaturesInitiativesSanta Claus FundFresh Air FundSpeakers BureauClassroom ConnectionToronto Star ArchivesReport on Community Giving\u00a9 Copyright Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd. 1996 - 2016Privacy PolicyTerms and Conditions"

native leaders, activists and victims' families seeking to know why more than 1,200 indigenous women were murdered or have gone missing over the past three decades.\nIndigenous women represent four percent of Canada's population but 16 percent of homicide victims.\nTasked with digging into the root causes of this violence, and granted powers to summon witnesses and subpoena documents, the panel led by Buller will report its preliminary findings and make recommendations next year.\n\u00a0\n\nFive commissioners leading missing and murdered indigenous women inquiry named https://t.co/MkuU0e1wAT\n\t\u2014 Global BC (@GlobalBC) August 3, 2016\n\n\u00a0\nA final report on improving native women's safety and ways to commemorate the dead will be released in 2018.\n\"The national inquiry is an important step in our journey of reconciliation with indigenous people in Canada,\" Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett told a press conference.\n\"This inquiry is needed to achieve justice and healing and to put an end to this ongoing and terrible tragedy.\"\nDisparities\nConcern over violence against aboriginal women became an issue after dozens of prostitutes went missing in Vancouver's seedy Downtown Eastside and were later determined to have been victims of a serial killer.\nThe previous Conservative administration had long resisted calls for an inquiry, seeing the disproportionate number of deaths and disappearances as resulting from domestic violence.\nA 2014 report and an update last year by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police identified 1,049 murdered and 172 missing aboriginal women between 1980 and 2012.\nIn most cases, the perpetrators were known to the victims.\nBut Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government has linked the violence to racism, sexism, colonialism, poverty, unemployment, lack of safe transportation, mental health and substance abuse.\nSome 2,000 native women who met with ministers in recent months to lay the groundwork for the inquiry \"left no doubt in our minds about the urgent need to examine the underlying and deep systemic challenges of this violence, including racism, sexism and the sustained impact of colonialism,\" said Bennett.\nShe said policing and the child welfare system would also be examined, while Minister of Status of Women Patty Hadju said the inquiry would look at institutional sexism and racism.\nHolding back tears, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, who is herself an indigenous woman, said the inquiry would focus on \"the root causes of the disproportionate rates of violence, crime against aboriginal women and girls.\"\n\"We need to identify the causes of those disparities and take action now to end them,\" she said.\n\"We know that the inquiry cannot undo the injustices that indigenous peoples have suffered over decades but we can review what has happened in the past, reflect on our present circumstances and chart a path moving forward.\"\nAFP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment Now!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion Policy\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED

I just assumed she was with them,\u201d says her youngest son, Bob Frezie, who was 17 and living with his mom at the time.\u201cI was the one who made the missing person report,\u201d Frezie remembers, sitting at his oldest brother Clayton Stewart\u2019s kitchen table.It wasn\u2019t until May 7 of the same year that Dianne\u2019s body was found by a community member who came across her remains while horseback riding.\u201cShe wasn\u2019t found too far from the party. She was found up behind the band office,\u201d says Frezie.Police say Stewart was last seen walking west on Westhills Drive wearing a black leather jacket, black jeans and winter boots.\u201cThrough a forensic autopsy, it was determined that Ms. Stewart died as a result of foul play,\u201d RCMP spokesman Const. James Grandy said in an email.The cause of Stewart\u2019s death has never been made public.Dianne was missing for just over five months before her body was found. It was a time her sons call \u201cunbearable.\u201d\u201cI felt paralyzed. She was missing and I\u2019d go to a store and run into people and they\u2019d be like, \u2018I\u2019m sorry Clay,\u201d\u2019 Clayton remembers. \u201cYou always had this hope that she was still around.\u201dClayton and Frezie spent those long six months together, often at their mom\u2019s home, waiting for answers. They thought she might come home, they say, as they listened to the helicopters above searching for her.\n\u201cWe were so lost, we were just looking out the windows,\u201d says Clayton.Her big heart and soft ways made Stewart a mother to many.Frezie says she took in most of his friends growing up and loved them as she loved her own children. Many of his friends called her \u201cmom,\u201d he remembers.Stewart\u2019s unsolved murder remains a small, yet significant part of what the 2019 National Inquiry Report on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls calls \u201ca form of genocide.\u201dIn the MMIWG final report, Rebecca Moore, a l\u2019nu woman from the Kjipuktuk district of Mi\u2019kma\u2019ki, said Canada has failed to value the lives of Indigenous women when the women go missing or are murdered.\u201cBeing an Indigenous woman means living under a society and \u2018civilization\u2019 that benefits from your voicelessness, invisibility, disappearance, non-existence, and erasure,\u201d writes Moore.Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett promised a national action plan would be announced by June 3, 2020, the one year anniversary of the report\u2019s release.In May, Bennett said the plan has been delayed due to COVID-19. While Indigenous peoples make up just over 5% of the population in Canada, they make up 27% of those murdered, according to the 2019 Stats Can report.Stewart\u2019s family wants answers about what happened to her. They say they will not give up.\u201cLife is fragile, you got to be careful and look after the people you love,\u201d says Clayton.\u2014If you have any information about any of the missing or murdered women, please call CrimeStoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nClayton Stewart\n \nDianne Stewart\n \nBob Frezie\n \nCarolyn Bennett\n \nSociology\n \nClothing\n \nPolice\n \nPolitics\n \nRebecca Moore\n \n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                Recommended for you\n                \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                Most Popular\n                \n            \n\n\n\n\n Articles\n\n\n Images\n\n\n Videos\n\n\n\n\nArticlesPenticton mall trying to evict The Bay over unpaid rent1-way tickets out of Penticton?Grooveyard founder-owner LeAnne Jakubeit loses battle to cancerEnd-the-lockdown rally planned for noon on Sunday outside Cherry LaneCity getting own Candy Cane LaneRetailer fires back in mall rent disputeLake-to-lake cycle route confirmedHeritage registry showing its ageMasks now mandatory for all indoor public, retail spacesToo late to save Sickle Point?\n\nImages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                Submit Your News\n                \n                    \n\n\nWe're always interested in hearing about news in our community.

He was arrested 16 months after Tina\u2019s body, wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down by rocks, was pulled from the Red River in central Winnipeg in 2014.\nShe had run away from a hotel, where she was being housed by Child and Family Services, and was being sexually exploited. Her death shocked the city and led the Manitoba government to phase out the use of hotels for kids in government care.\nCrown attorney James Ross laid out his theory for the jurors. He said Tina had a happy childhood and was raised by Favel on the Sagkeeng First Nation, a 90-minute drive northeast of Winnipeg.\nFavel said everything changed when Tina\u2019s father, who had cancer and was unable to care for her, was murdered in October 2011.\n\u201cIt hurt her bad. She cried constantly,\u201d Favel testified.\nTina got a tattoo with her father\u2019s name, a pair of angel wings, and his dates of birth and death, she said.\nTina\u2019s mother, who had not been part of her life, re-emerged after that and Tina found out she had younger siblings, Favel said.\nThat led Tina to go to Winnipeg to visit her mother for what was supposed to be one week in late June 2014.\nFavel told court she had given Tina a pre-paid phone card, didn\u2019t hear from her and called around trying to find her.\n\u201cI called the police. I called (Child and Family Services), but nobody found her.\u201d\nBy that time, Ross said, Tina had fallen into street life and was being sexually exploited.\nRoss told jurors they will hear evidence from Cormier\u2019s friends, as well as from wiretaps of Cormier\u2019s apartment, that he killed the teenager because he was worried he might be arrested.\n\u201cThere will be evidence from Mr. Cormier\u2019s associates that he and Tina had a bad falling out \u2026 that ended with her threatening to report him to the police,\u201d Ross said.\nCormier had sex with Tina and later was angry upon finding out she was only 15 ,one year below the age of consent, Ross said.\n\u201cMr. Cormier told associates that Tina Fontaine \u2018got killed because we, I, found out she was 15.\u201d\u2019\nRoss also said Cormier was worried Tina was going to report him for possessing a stolen truck, the same one the Crown believes was used to transport her body to the river.\nTina weighed just 77 pounds when she disappeared. Her body was weighed down in the river by rocks, which kept it from surfacing for days, Ross said.\nThe long time in the water means there is no DNA evidence for the trial.\n\u201cSimply put, time and the river washed away any evidence there was on the body or the duvet cover.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

The best friend of a Manitoba Indigenous woman killed during a botched robbery looked at a man guilty in the killing and asked how a life could be worth only $45. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Kelly Malone\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWINNIPEG \u2014 The best friend of a Manitoba Indigenous woman killed during a botched robbery looked at a man convicted in her death and asked how a life could be worth that little to him.\n\"Forty-five dollars was what my friend's life was valued in (Jason) Meilleur's eyes,\" Melissa Stevenson said during a sentencing hearing Wednesday.\n\n\n\n  article continues below\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\nCourthouse steps covered in red handprints in name of opioid crisis\nPoisson's OT punch flattens Vipers\nDale's reply unwarranted\nEverybody loses tonight in Alberta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can give you that $45 if you can give me my friend back.\"\nJeanenne Fontaine, 29, was shot and her Winnipeg home set on fire in 2017 when three men came to her house to collect on a drug debt her boyfriend owed. In January, a jury found Meilleur guilty of manslaughter.\n\nStevenson told Meilleur's sentencing hearing that her friend was struggling with addiction after her cousin's death, but she had goals to get clean and be a good mother to her three children.\n\"Her life was beautiful, her life mattered and she deserved better,\" Stevenson said.\nFontaine was the cousin of Tina Fontaine, a teenager whose body had been found three years earlier in the Red River, and whose death fuelled renewed calls for a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women.\nTina had also spiralled downward after her father, Eugene Fontaine, was beaten to death in 2011. Two men pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Victim impact statements at their trial described how Tina had a happy childhood, but was unable to cope with her father's death and drifted away from the people closest to her.\nIn diary entries read in court, Jeanenne Fontaine wrote a list of goals for her life. The final one said: \"I need to find a new home.\"\nMeilleur's eyes filled with tears as he apologized to the woman's family and friends.\n\"There's not a day that goes by that I also don't think of her,\" he said. \"I'm sorry. I truly am sorry.\"\nThe trial heard how the three men showed up at Fontaine's house to collect a drug debt for Meilleur's girlfriend and were looking for Fontaine's boyfriend. When he wasn't there, the situation turned into a botched robbery in which she was shot in the head and the house was set on fire.\nMalcolm Mitchell pleaded guilty to second-degree murder last year and was sentenced to life. Christopher Brass was found guilty of manslaughter and in January was given 15 years, which is to be served at the same time as life sentences for first- and second-degree murder convictions in separate matters. He will not be eligible for parole for 40 years.\nCrown prosecutor Michael Desautels argued that Meilleur was the \"Trojan Horse.\" He was collecting the debt, he brought Mitchell and Brass and he was the one who got them invited into the home.\n\"He was bringing two hyenas with him, people he knew were violent,\" Desautels said.\nDefence lawyer Theodore Mariash argued his client was only going to collect the debt, and should have stepped in to stop the others when things turned dangerous. But, Mariash said, he can't be compared to the two other men who are \"homicidal maniacs.\"\n\"Brass is a mass murderer.

It has published report cards holding the federal government to account for failing on many of the 231 calls to justice in the national action plan on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and two-spirited people (MMIWG2S).The latest report card was released in June and gave the government a failing grade.  The provinces and municipalities need to start taking their share of responsibility as well, Carol McBride, president of NWAC, said. She called on the provinces and municipalities to create their own action plans to address MMIWG2S.Indigenous women, girls and two-spirited peoples live all over the country, and \u201cit\u2019s getting pretty scary to just walk the streets or go to a store,\u201d she said.

(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP)For decades, Canada\u2019s indigenous people have warned that a disproportionately large number of their women and girls were vanishing or being killed, that police investigations of these crimes were careless, and that their pleas for help were being ignored.On Monday, the government-appointed commission that has been investigating the claims announced its explosive conclusion: Canada\u2019s indigenous women and girls are \u201cunder siege,\u201d and their deaths and disappearances amount to \u201ca race-based genocide.\u201dThe Canadian National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls released its final report at a morning ceremony in Gatineau, Quebec, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and family members of victims.ADVERTISEMENTSkip\n\n\n................................................................\u201cGenocide is the sum of the social practices, assumptions and actions detailed within this report,\u201d the commission concluded. It laid out in detail over more than 1,200 pages how a mix of \u201cappalling apathy\u201d and \u201ccolonialist structures\u201d has fueled a \u201cnational tragedy\u201d centuries in the making.\u201cThis is not what Canada is supposed to be about,\u201d the commission wrote. \u201cIt is not what it purports to stand for.\u201dThe commission itself has drawn criticism for staff turnover and an alleged lack of transparency. Critics say the process won\u2019t bring justice because the panel wasn\u2019t granted the authority to compel police to reopen cold cases.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks at the closing ceremony for the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in Gatineau, Canada, Monday, June 3, 2019. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP)Trudeau, who promised a \u201ctotal renewal\u201d of Canada\u2019s relationship with its 1.6 million indigenous people, launched the $92 million inquiry shortly after assuming office in 2015.\u201cThis is an uncomfortable day for Canada, but it is an essential day,\u201d he said Monday. He promised to review the report and to implement a plan. The report \u201cwill not be placed on a shelf to collect dust,\u201d he promised, to applause.The commission, headed by Marion Buller, British Columbia\u2019s first female indigenous judge, crisscrossed the country for more than two years to take testimony from roughly 2,400 witnesses, including survivors and family members of victims.They described the bodies of sisters, mothers and daughters being dredged out of rivers or found along a desolate stretch of highway in British Columbia where so many indigenous women and girls have disappeared or been killed that it\u2019s called the \u201cHighway of Tears.\u201dWitnesses told the commission that police were slow to launch missing-persons investigations and quick to label unexplained deaths as drownings, suicides or drug overdoses, even when evidence suggested foul play.ADVERTISEMENTSkip\n\n\n\n\n\n................................................................The Royal Canadian Mounted Police reported 1,181 cases of murdered or missing indigenous women and girls from 1980 to 2012. Indigenous women are six times as likely to be victims of homicide than non-indigenous women, the government agency Statistics Canada reported in 2017.\nAttendees console each other at the closing ceremony for the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in Gatineau, Quebec., on Monday, June 3, 2019. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP)But those figures could be a gross undercount, according to the commission, which concluded that \u201cno one knows the exact number\u201d because thousands of deaths and disappearances \u201chave likely gone unrecorded.\u201dThe commission concluded that colonial violence, racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia against indigenous women and girls have become so woven into the fabric of their lives that many have become accustomed to it.Contributing to the violence, the commission said, are historical trauma from government-directed family separation policies, residential schools and land dispossession; social and economic marginalization; and a lack of willingness among Canadian institutions to change.An \u201cabsolute paradigm shift\u201d is needed \u201cto dismantle colonialism within Canadian society,\u201d the commission said.Among its 231 recommendations, the commission advised creating an independent task force to investigate unresolved cases, increasing punishments for violent offenses when the victims are indigenous women, and granting indigenous languages the same official status as English and French.\u201cToday, we hold up a mirror to Canada,\u201d Buller said. She said the report\u2019s action items were not just \u201crecommendations\u201d but \u201clegal imperatives.\u201dTrudeau promised change.ADVERTISEMENTSkip................................................................\u201cI know and you know that we need to fix the way things work in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must continue to decolonize our existing structures, and the racism, sexism and economic inequality that has allowed such violence against indigenous women and girls to prevail must be eradicated.\u201dCanada\u2019s indigenous people long called for a probe into missing and slain women and girls. Trudeau\u2019s Conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper, said the issue had been \u201cstudied to death\u201d and was not \u201creally high\u201d on his government\u2019s \u201cradar.\u201dThe death in 2014 of 15-year-old Tina Fontaine, whose body was found in a Manitoba river wrapped in a blanket and weighed down with rocks, galvanized public attention. In the 24 hours before her death, she met with social workers, police and emergency room doctors, but no one kept her safe.\u201cThe fact that this national inquiry is happening now doesn\u2019t mean that indigenous people waited this long to speak up,\u201d the commission said. \u201cIt means it took this long for Canada to listen.\u201dNot everyone felt heard.Danielle Ewenin said she attended a commission hearing in Saskatchewan in 2017 to testify about her sister.Eleanor \u201cLaney\u201d Ewenin was found dead in a field on the outskirts of Calgary in 1982 at age 23. Police filed a report under an incorrect name; the case remains unsolved.Ewenin said she decided to testify because she \u201cwanted to make a difference for indigenous women.\u201d But, she said, the inquiry operated under a patriarchal and colonial model that was not responsive to families, and its \u201cmismanagement, bungling, ineptness and incompetence\u201d doomed it to fail.ADVERTISEMENTSkip................................................................Ewenin said frequent calls to her caseworker, responsible for helping her track down police and coroner\u2019s reports, went unanswered. She eventually obtained the records herself, she said, but was told it was too late to include them in the inquiry\u2019s forensic audit of police files.\u201cI\u2019m having a hard time disassociating myself from my feelings of anger and betrayal and injustice,\u201d she said. \u201cThey did not find or honor the truth with my sister.\u201dCalls from family members of victims to reset the inquiry in 2017 went unheeded.Buller told The Washington Post last year that the commission had struggled with communicating with families. She blamed early missteps on bureaucratic challenges and the initial two-year deadline. (Buller requested a two-year extension. The government granted six more months.)In a foreword to the report, Buller criticized the government for failing to grant the full extension, saying \u201cmany truths\u201d will go \u201cunspoken and unknown\u201d as a result.The commission said the additional time would have allowed the forensic audit team to look at more files, such as those pertaining to Ewenin\u2019s sister.The commission said police blamed victims and employed racist stereotypes in interactions with indigenous women. It singled out the RCMP for failing to provide all of the files it subpoenaed.Anita Ross testified before the commission in Thunder Bay, Ontario, about the death of her 16-year-old daughter. Delaine Copenace went missing in 2016 and was found dead weeks later in a lake near her home. Police were late to investigate her disappearance, Ross said, and labeled her death an accidental drowning \u2013 a conclusion she rejects.Ross watched the ceremony on television. She was glad to see Trudeau attending with his wife, she said, and was \u201ctrying to feel optimistic.\u201dThe question is whether the government will act.\u201cWe\u2019re all hopeful, but we\u2019re just wondering if it will happen,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople say things, but will they follow through?\u201d \n\n\n\n\nShare\nTweet\nLinkedIn\nEmail\nPrint\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlertMe\n\n\n\nMore News\nWorld \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\nLoad comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to the Albuquerque Journal for only $10.\n\n\n\n\nQUICK LINKS\n\nHome\nSearch\nArchives\nPuzzles\nComics\nNewsletters\nNotifications\n\n\n\nCONTACT THE JOURNAL\n\nStaff directory\nSubmit a news tip\nSend a letter to the editor\n505-823-3800\n\n\nSubmit an obituary\nAdvertise in the Journal\nCareer opportunities\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBER SERVICES\n\nAccount services\nSubscribe to the Journal\nRecover password\nRegister account\n505-823-4400\n\n\n\nPlace a classified ad\nPrivacy policy\nTerms of service\nContest Terms\n\n\n\nRELATED SITES & PARTNERS\n\nJournal Rewards\n\nNews in Education\n\n\n\nRio Rancho Observer\nValencia News-Bulletin\nEl Defensor Chieftain\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Albuquerque Journal | Albuquerque, N.M.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOP |  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport local journalism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport local journalism\n$10/mo\n\nAccess the eJournal replica\nEnjoy Journal Rewards\nUninterrupted web experience\nCancel anytime\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\nOther Offers\n\n\n\nSign up for newsletters\nEnable notifications\n\n\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The community is still reeling in the aftermath of the tragic incident. - Contributed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The following is a first-person account from a family member of Cassidy Jean Bernard, who was found dead in her home on the We\u2019koqma\u2019q First Nation on Oct. 24. The RCMP is continuing its investigation into the case.\n\n\nWE\u2019KOQMA\u2019Q \u2014 The morning of October 24, 2018 will forever be etched in my memories. Those memories will haunt my family forever.\nThey aren\u2019t pleasant memories, they aren\u2019t snapshots of the picturesque scenery that surrounds our beautiful community, they aren\u2019t full of joy, and sadly they aren\u2019t even full of life.\n\nAnnie Bernard-Daisley\n\nThe morning of Oct. 24 was heavily dark and gloomy, almost like a forerunner of things to come. Rain beat down on our community, bringing a sign of our heartache and the uncountable tears that will flow.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an emergency at Mona\u2019s. You guys should leave and check on her,\u201d said We\u2019koqma\u2019q Chief Rod Googoo, to me and others at that morning\u2019s band council meeting.\nOn the way, I vaguely remember the drive over and the walk in to my cousin\u2019s house. Once there, I found out that my beautiful cousin, Cassidy Jean Bernard, had died.\nDied?? Where are her babies? How did she die? Oh my god! Mona is screaming and crying in agonizing pain of finding her baby girl Cassidy dead.\nAs myself and a couple of my cousins tended to Cassidy\u2019s two babies, Mya and Paisley, it seemed like chaos surrounded us \u2014 grief, shock, anger, sadness, worry and every other emotion that no one wants to feel. Confusion sets in my head and sadness, complete sadness that\u2019s mirrored in the babies\u2019 eyes.\nI held and fed Mya as she stared into my eyes. Paisley also had the same look in her eyes, sadness, no crying, just a look of pure sadness. These babies witnessed the life leave their mother, and just six months before the morning of Oct. 24 they were still nestled healthy and safe in their mommy\u2019s belly.\nAs we gathered at my aunt\u2019s \u2014 Mona\u2019s mother\u2019s house \u2014 we all carried the hurt and shocked looks on our faces. Then, slowly but surely, anger and rage set in.\nWho the heck would want to hurt a beautiful person like Cassidy?\nA murderer did, that\u2019s who!\nIn no time, forensics and major crime investigators descended on the scene to gather information and to speak to and question anyone and everyone.\nAs I write this, it\u2019s been 14 days since that morning. At this point, we know as much as everyone else.\nAt Cassidy\u2019s funeral, the priest said that we are in our second life and the next life that we live will be in the afterlife. As a community steeped in the Catholic religion, our status on Earth is in limbo. We are in purgatory waiting for an arrest.\nAboriginal women make up four per cent of the total female population in Canada. Aboriginal women also make up 16 per cent of missing and murdered women in Canada. When did this become normal? Right now, it is normal. Those statistics make it normal.\nIn fact, there are so many cases that the Canadian government doesn\u2019t have an exact number. They estimate between 1,000 to 4,000. Do I really live in the \u201cbest\u201d country in the world? Do I really live in the safest country in the world?\nI have three daughters and at any time in their precious lives, they could go missing and murdered \u2014 the alarming stats say so. We, as Indigenous women, are seven times more likely to go missing and be killed than your average non-native woman.\nIt definitely isn\u2019t anything about our upbringing, let me tell you that.\nLet me tell you a little about our Pulnol family. We were all raised to protect, love, cherish and to just be there for each other. Our grandparents, Charlie and Annie Mae, taught us these values and they are just as strong today as they were when they were alive. Cassidy Jean Bernard, a granddaughter as well, was brought up with the exact same principles.\nNationally, we hear of the Highway of Tears in British Columbia, the Robert Pickton case where most of his victims were Aboriginal. Do you want to know why? Because it has been proven time and again that some police officers show little to no empathy to the victim\u2019s family.\nWe hear of the derogatory term \u201cjust another dead Indian.\u201d You know that term has become legendary nationwide. It speaks for itself. It is so hard not to be angry. As a mother of daughters, this hurts my soul. As a cousin to Cassidy, this hurts too much. It is raw and the feelings are fresh.\n\nCassidy Jean Bernard\u2019s death left Mya and Paisley, her infant twin daughters, without a mother.\n\nWhat I want Canada to know is that killers and murderers walk amongst us. They walk amongst us because they have never been convicted and tried and brought to justice.\nWhat I want Cassidy\u2019s killer to know is that we are strong. We are stronger that you ever will be. You left two babies for dead as you walked away from Cassidy\u2019s lifeless body.\nYou are a coward. You took her away from us. You took a mommy away from her babies and you took a baby girl away from her mother. You took a sister, an aunt, a granddaughter, a cousin, a niece and a friend away from us all.\nAs mothers of the next generation, we are going to teach our girls to fight. Fight for their lives! We are living in the best country in the world, a country that was founded on unceded territorial land and still we are forced to learn to fight for our lives. This is the sad reality.\nMy hope is that there will be justice for Cassidy. My hope is that we, as aboriginal women, will not have to live in fear of being an ignored statistic. My hope is that an arrest and the person responsible is brought to justice.\nI pray that the team investigating does so with meticulous care, that nothing is left unturned, that they feel our family\u2019s emotions and witness the raw pain in Cassidy\u2019s family. Our thoughts are with you as well. It can\u2019t be easy to work in this field. Please do not be so desensitized that this is brushed aside.\nNow, let me tell you a little about Cassidy. Oh my! Such pure beauty. She was a sparkler! A natural firecracker, small in stature but bigger than life. She had so many friends that she loved and they loved her just as much. The attentive and creative side of her personality was amazing to witness.\nShe was strong in her Mi\u2019kmaq culture, a speaker of the language and a singer of our language. There are so many videos capturing her beautiful voice, her distinctive voice. I can\u2019t help but smile just thinking of her and how she spoke, how hearing her sing to her babies on video is a beautiful thing to watch.\nAnd her pregnancy. Oh, my goodness! It was exciting to find out that she was expecting twins. Two girls that were born a little early but healthy and strong. They thrived and were so well taken care of by their mommy.\nThey were her life. She fed, bathed, burped, and even nursed those precious babies like a professional. She took to motherhood so gracefully. Being a mom myself, I couldn\u2019t imagine handling two at a time and it was amazing how well she did. She was a loving mother with her precious cargo.\nYou see, I want you all to know that side of Cassidy. She was a person, a human whose life was shortened unfairly.\nThe Justin Trudeau government had recognized in 2015 that an inquiry should be held \u2014 the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\nLast month, the inquiry announced its final public hearing dates and a final report and recommendations will be sent to the government by April 2019.\nTo me, it\u2019s simple: treat every homicide like you would treat a non-native homicide. Then, we wouldn\u2019t have needed the inquiry. Our lives matter.\nRemember that killers walk amongst us. Remember that killers walk amongst you. Yes, that\u2019s right \u2014 you.\nBecause our lives as Indigenous women do not seem to matter, that means these killers are allowed to roam right beside you. Yes, get angry. Be mad, feel unsafe and get enraged. We all need to work together on this. Then, and only then, will these killers be removed from your vicinity.\nI have one final request: please be courageous.\nIf you have any information on Cassidy\u2019s death, please come forward, please be brave. I feel strong writing this for my family. I am giving you my strength to come forward.\nPlease think of Cassidy, think of her parents, Mona and Lonzo, think of her siblings, Jillian, Tyra, Rene and Jordan. Think of her babies. Come forward. Someone out there knows something. Be courageous.\n\u201cThe time to be scared is in the past. The past cannot hurt you. We have to learn from the past.

The national inquiry looking missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls says it needs more time to finish its work. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Andrew Vaughan\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n For decades, Canada's indigenous people have warned that a disproportionately large number of their women and girls were vanishing or being killed, that police investigations of these crimes were careless, and that their pleas for help were being ignored.\n On Monday, the government-appointed commission that has been investigating the claims is set to release its explosive conclusion: Canada's indigenous women and girls are \"under siege,\" and their deaths and disappearances amount to \"a race-based genocide.\"\n\n\n\n  article continues below\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\nP.G. woman ranked Top 100 in Maxim cover girl contest\nMLA still working on bill to ban glysophate from B.C. forests\nTelus to extend fibre optic network to city households\nMikhalchuk knocks the stuffing out of Royals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Canadian National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls is set to release its final report at a ceremony Monday morning in Gatineau, Quebec. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and family members of victims are expected to attend.\n \"Genocide is the sum of the social practices, assumptions and actions detailed within this report,\" the commission concludes in an executive summary obtained by The Washington Post. It lays out in detail how a mix of \"appalling apathy\" and \"colonialist structures\" has fueled a \"national tragedy\" centuries in the making.\n\n Trudeau, who promised a \"total renewal\" of Canada's relationship with its 1.6 million indigenous people, launched the $92 million inquiry shortly after assuming office in 2015.\n But the commission has drawn criticism for high staff turnover and an alleged lack of transparency. Critics say the process won't bring justice because the commission wasn't granted the authority to compel police to reopen cold cases.\n The commission, headed by Marion Buller, British Columbia's first female indigenous judge, crisscrossed the country for more than two years to take testimony from roughly 2,400 witnesses, including survivors and family members of victims.\n They described the bodies of sisters, mothers and daughters being dredged out of rivers or found along a desolate stretch of highway in British Columbia where so many indigenous women and girls have disappeared or been killed that it is called the \"Highway of Tears.\"\n They said police were slow to launch missing-persons investigations and quick to label unexplained deaths as drownings, suicides or drug overdoses, even when evidence suggested foul play.\n The Royal Canadian Mounted Police reported 1,181 cases of murdered or missing indigenous women and girls from 1980 to 2012. Indigenous women are six times as likely to be victims of homicide than non-indigenous women, the government agency Statistics Canada reported in 2017.\n But those figures could be a gross undercount, according to the commission, which concludes that \"no one knows the exact number\" because thousands of deaths and disappearances \"have likely gone unrecorded.\"\n The commission concludes that colonial violence, racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia against indigenous women and girls have become so woven into the fabric of their lives that many have become accustomed to violence.\n Contributing to that violence, the commission says, are historical and intergenerational trauma from government-directed family separation policies, residential schools and land dispossession; social and economic marginalization; and a lack of willingness among Canadian institutions to change.\n An \"absolute paradigm shift\" is needed \"to dismantle colonialism within Canadian society,\" the commission says. It recommends creating an independent task force to investigate unresolved cases and increasing punishments for violent offenses when the victims are indigenous women.\n Canada's indigenous people have long called for a probe into missing and slain women and girls. Trudeau's Conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper, said the issue had been \"studied to death\" and was not \"really high\" on his government's \"radar.\"\n \"The fact that this national inquiry is happening now doesn't mean that indigenous people waited this long to speak up,\" the commission says. \"It means it took this long for Canada to listen.\"\n Not everyone felt heard.\n Danielle Ewenin says she attended a commission hearing in Saskatchewan in 2017 to testify about her sister.\n Eleanor \"Laney\" Ewenin was found dead in a field on the outskirts of Calgary in 1982 at age 23. Police filed a report under an incorrect name; the case remains unsolved.\n Ewenin said she decided to testify because she \"wanted to make a difference for indigenous women.\" But, she said, the inquiry operated under a patriarchal and colonial model that was not responsive to families, and its \"mismanagement, bungling, ineptness and incompetence\" doomed it to fail.\n Ewenin says frequent calls to her caseworker, responsible for helping her track down police and coroner's reports, went unanswered. She eventually obtained the records herself, she said, but was told it was too late to include them in the inquiry's forensic audit of police files.\n \"I'm having a hard time disassociating myself from my feelings of anger and betrayal and injustice,\" she said. \"They did not find or honor the truth with my sister.\"\n Buller acknowledged last year that the commission had struggled with communicating with families. She blamed early missteps on bureaucratic challenges and the initial two-year deadline. (Buller requested a two-year extension. The government granted six more months.)\n \"When we first started, all that commissioners and I had was a piece of paper and a cellphone,\" Buller told The Post in May 2018. \"We're designing the car, building the car, driving the car and loading passengers into the car all at the same time.\"\n She told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. that she understood \"if people are frustrated, but this is a national inquiry with a very strict timeline handling horrible, horrible subject matters.\"\n Calls from family members of victims to reset the inquiry in 2017 went unheeded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead Related Topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright  Prince George Citizen\n 'Please support the Prince George Citizen and online news like this by purchasing a digital subscription.'\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n              Comments\n          \n\n          \t              \tNOTE: To post a comment you must have an account with at least one of the following services: Disqus, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ You may then login using your account credentials for that service.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/John Woods  WINNIPEG - Roland Mousseau erupted in anger Thursday as the second of two teenage girls who killed his stepdaughter in a beating that was shared online was given a youth sentence.\t\t\t Extra sheriff's officers were called in as Mousseau yelled at the girl just before she was led away. Another family member shouted \"no justice.\" Others cried softly. They all wore red T-shirts adorned with a picture of Serena McKay.\t\t\t    \n\n\nMcKay was repeatedly pummelled as she lay on the ground outside a house party on the Sagkeeng First Nation in April 2017. The 19-year-old was left outside and died of hypothermia, with blunt-force trauma a contributing factor.\t\t\t Her attackers recorded the assault on video, which was then shared via social media messages.\t\t\t \n\n\n    Roland Mousseau (left) and Delores Daniels (middle-right) speak to reporters after a youth was sentenced in the beating death of Daniels' daughter, Serena McKay, on the Sagkeeng First nation, in Winnipeg on Thursday, August 2, 2018. Mousseau, who was the victim's stepfather, erupted in court and shouted that the youth sentence given out Thursday was not nearly enough. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Steve Lambert  Two girls, who were 16 and 17 at the time of the attack, were charged and pleaded guilty. They cannot be identified under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.\t\t\t The older one was given a three-year sentence for second-degree murder in June. The younger was handed the maximum youth sentence for manslaughter Thursday \u2014 two years in jail and one year under supervision in the community.\t\t\t \"We expected an adult sentence ... and we didn't get what we deserved. My daughter didn't get what she deserved,\" McKay's mother, Delores Daniels, said outside court.\t\t\t \"Is three years what (you) get for a life, for taking a life? That's not fair at all.\"\t\t\t Provincial court Judge Lindy Choy called the attack a reprehensible act of \"astonishing cruelty\".\t\t\t \"Serena was not fighting back. She was lying down, crying,\" Choy said as she sentenced the teenager.\t\t\t \"It is clear that you had no mercy.\"\t\t\t Shortly afterward, the girl uploaded a picture of herself on social media. She was partly covered in blood, and the picture had the caption: \"I've been chilling,\" Choy said.\t\t\t The Crown had asked for an adult sentence of seven years in prison, but Choy ruled the teen did not have the moral capacity and blameworthiness of an adult.\t\t\t Defence lawyer James Wood told the court in June his client suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder from sexual assaults, and would drink to the point of blacking out.\t\t\t She doesn't remember the night of the attack, Wood said.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAdvertise With Us\n\n\n\n\nReport Error\nSubmit a Tip\nRefundRefund\n\n\n\nThe Winnipeg Free Press is not accepting comments on this story.\nWhy aren't comments accepted on this story?

This ideology, grounded in the belief that men own women and that women need to be controlled, is also at the heart of gender inequities.Although the tragic events at the Polytechnique occurred 30 years ago, women and girls in Canada today continue to suffer from the effects of patriarchal ideologies. They experience that patriarchy differently, depending on where they are located in the matrix of domination - the axes of race, class, gender, religion, age, ableism and sexuality that criss-cross society and heighten the vulnerabilities of some women more than others.The Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Inquiry reveals the extent to which Indigenous women, girls and LGBTQ+ are dehumanized and subjected to violence. Canadian statistics reveal that a woman is killed every five days by her intimate partner or a family member. Murder is the finality in the continuum of violence that women and girls experience.Privilege does not shieldWe can't forget these deaths - the murders that are reported in short, terse paragraphs in the news, or that are accounted for only by organizations situated in particular communities, or remembered by close family and kin.These deaths testify to the presence and power of patriarchal values and traditions. Similarly, while groups like the incels  have attracted power and attention, they remain the tip of the iceberg. There are countless everyday expressions of male power and violence that work to constrain women.Much like how the focus on racism that tends to be restricted to the actions of extreme hate groups and their acts of violence, the systemic, everyday racism that permeates society also needs to be named and dealt with.The takeaway of the murders at the Polytechnique is this - violence that is endemic and coursing through society is violence that crosses the boundaries of race, class, age, sexuality, gender and religion. It's violence that is anchored in the view that women are inferior, less than men, and to be controlled by men.The 14 women killed at the Polytechnique were white, middle class and educated, and this did not shield them from patriarchal violence. What then about the women who have no such privileges? How best can we remember them?[Expertise in your inbox.

The five-person commission includes indigenous rights activists and First Nations law experts and will be led by British Columbia\u2019s first female First Nations judge, Marion Buller.\nIt has an estimated cost of $53.8 million \u2014 almost $14 million greater than previous projections. The government also pledged to spend a further $16.7 million over four years to develop family information liaison units and to increase funding for culturally appropriate victims\u2019 services.\nThe families\u2019 and the survivors\u2019 losses, pain, strength, and courage will inspire our work.\n\u201cThe spirits of the missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls will be close in our hearts and in our minds as we do our work,\u201d said Buller after the announcement on Wednesday. \u201cThe families\u2019 and the survivors\u2019 losses, pain, strength, and courage will inspire our work.\u201d \nUnder the Inquiries Act, the commission has the authority to \u201csummon witnesses and compel documents.\u201d\nThe inquiry is certainly long overdue, but some of the details announced Wednesday have been met with criticism. Amnesty International criticized the terms for not specifically addressing police procedures \u2014 a serious issue given the many indigenous women who have suffered abuse at the hands of police.\nThe Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada also said that they welcome the inquiry but are concerned that  \u201cthere is no explicit mention of the need to work with the justice partners in order to make appropriate recommendations to ensure that there are changes in that system.\u201d The group added that the inquiry \u201cmissed [an] opportunity\u201d by not including a process for families to reopen old cases.\nIn Canada, indigenous women are three times more likely to be victims of violence than other women. They are six times more likely to be murdered. According to a 2014 report by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, between 1980 and 2012 the police recorded about 1,200 homicides and unresolved disappearances of indigenous females. \nThe actual number of victims is likely much higher due to under-reporting and improper police investigations. Patty Hajdu, the minister for the status of women, has suggested that it could be as high as 4,000.\nThe investigation, one of Justin Trudeau\u2019s campaign promises, comes more than a decade after indigenous groups first requested it. The previous Conservative government refused to launch an inquiry despite explicit requests from Indigenous communities and the United Nations to do so. \nShortly after the Liberal government took office in December,  they held 17 information sessions with 2,000 friends and family members of the missing and murdered indigenous women. The government then developed a series of recommendations based on the meetings. \n\u201c[The family members] left no doubt in our minds about the urgent need to examine the underlying and deep, systemic challenges of this violence, including racism, sexism and the sustained impact of colonialism,\u201d Bennett said.\nRachel Cain is an intern at ThinkProgress.\n\nTags\n\nCanadadisappearancesIndigenous Peoplejustin trudeaumurderPolice\n\n \n\n\n\n\nShare\n678\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet ThinkProgress email alerts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a tip?

That's been hurtful to Burns's young daughter, who will never have the chance to bond with her mother, he said.\n\"That really gets me mad because my niece has to deal with that, has to hear that.\"\nBallantyne also took issue with Burns's killer being allowed to plead guilty to manslaughter after being charged with second-degree murder.

The rationale is that if people can abstain for some time prior to a transplant, they can abstain for some time afterwards,\u201d he said in an interview.\nMoore said Saunders\u2019 family is considering a court injunction.\nShe says her friend is anxious to take part in a Trillium pilot project, beginning in August, that will waive the abstinence policy for some alcoholics who agree to receive support for dealing with their addiction.\nMoore said the abstinence policy is preventing her and others from offering themselves as possible donors, while Saunders remains hooked up to hospital machinery to keep her alive. She was admitted to the hospital on Saturday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating wanting to be able to go and get tested to see if you\u2019re a match to save your best friend\u2019s life but being told, \u2018No, they\u2019re not even going to give it a chance,\u201d\u2019 said Moore.\nHumar said doctors must also consider that if they transplant a living person\u2019s liver to another person, there should be a high likelihood of success.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a major operation and we only want to do that if we\u2019re sure the transplant will be successful.\u201d\nThe doctor said there is significant shortage of donated livers.\nAs a result, about one third of the people in the program die while awaiting a transplant.\nSaunders is the sister of Loretta Saunders, who was murdered three years ago by two people subletting her Halifax apartment.\nThe Saunders\u2019 family recently gave emotionally charged testimony before the National Inquiry into Murder and Missing Women and Girls at Membertou First Nation in Cape Breton.\nAs for the challenges Saunders faces in getting a transplant, her case is the latest in a series of similar cases in recent years.\nCary Gallant, a 45-year-old alcoholic denied access to the Ontario wait list, had launched a case in the fall challenging the constitutionality of Trillium\u2019s rule.\nGallant\u2019s goal was to have Trillium agree to assess patients who consume alcohol on a case-by-case basis for possible waivers.\nDebra Selkirk, whose husband Mark died from liver disease, had planned a constitutional challenge of the six-month policy when he was refused a transplant.\nShe said she dropped her two-year fight due Trillium\u2019s commitment to start the pilot project and to provide transplants to almost 100 patients with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\u201cI think an exception should be made for everybody,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI think they should start transplanting now.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for Trillium did not respond to a request for an interview on the medical reasons for its policy.\nHowever, Jennifer Long wrote that the agency is \u201cin the midst of finalizing the pilot program.\u201d\nHumar said there is variation in existing research on what percentage of alcoholics who are provided with transplanted livers will return to drinking.\n\u201cIn patients transplanted for alcoholic liver disease the (rates of recidivism) is anywhere from 10 to 40 per cent. It varies a lot on the types of patients transplanted, how long they\u2019ve been abstinent and what kind of addictions support you have on hand for those kinds of patients.\u201d\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

(THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang) \nGATINEAU, Que.\u2014Family members wiped away tears Wednesday, Aug. 3, as the federal government outlined the terms of an inquiry into the phenomenon of missing and murdered aboriginal women\u2014along with a price tag that is nearly $14 million higher than expected.\nThree cabinet ministers were on hand inside the Museum of History\u2019s great hall\u2014a space bedecked with long houses, totem poles and artwork dedicated to Canada\u2019s Aboriginal Peoples\u2014to hand the reins of the nascent inquiry to independent commissioners.\nThose commissioners will provide concrete recommendations to federal, provincial, and territorial governments about how to deal with the disproportionate rates of violence and crime against Canada\u2019s indigenous women and girls.\nJustice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould heralded Wednesday\u2019s events as evidence that the Liberal government is committed to honouring the lives of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.\nWilson-Raybould, a former B.C. regional chief for the Assembly of First Nations, appeared to be nearly overcome with emotion at one point as she looked out across a room filled with the family members of missing and murdered women.\nWe can review what\u2019s happened in the past, reflect on our present circumstances, and chart a path moving forward.\u2014  Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould\nBy digging for root causes, including past and present systemic and institutional barriers, the commission will play a key role in defining actions needed to protect the human rights of indigenous women and girls, she said.\n\u201cWe know that the inquiry cannot undo the injustices that indigenous peoples have suffered over decades, but we can review what\u2019s happened in the past, reflect on our present circumstances, and chart a path moving forward.\u201d\nNor will the federal government wait until the end of the inquiry to take action to help curb the violence, said Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett.\nThe process, designed to be arm\u2019s length from government once it is up and running on Sept. 1, is expected to last at least two years and cost at least $53.8 million\u2014$13.8 million more than was originally expected.\nBennett said the inquiry will reflect what the government heard during pre-inquiry consultations: that policing and child welfare policies will be put under the microscope, that it will not take a one-size-fits-all approach, and will take into account regional differences when crafting recommendations.\nCeejai Julian, who lost two sisters, wipes her eye during the announcement of the inquiry into murdered and missing indigenous women at the Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec, on Aug. 3, 2016. (THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang)\nAs part of Wednesday\u2019s formalities, ministers delivered to the commissioners a gift basket made of birch bark, lined with sealskin and wrapped in a red Metis sash. Inside was a digital copy of all the pre-inquiry research.\nThe five commissioners responsible for carrying out the inquiry are:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Chief commissioner Marion Buller, B.C.\u2019s first female First Nations judge \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Michele Audette, a former president of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Qajaq Robinson, an Ottawa-based, Nunavut-born lawyer who practices civil litigation with an emphasis on aboriginal law \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Marilyn Poitras, a professor at the University of Saskatchewan with a focus on indigenous law \u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Brian Eyolfson, a First Nations lawyer based in Ontario\nUnder the Inquiries Act, the commissioners will have the same powers as any court in a civil case to enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give evidence. They can also examine all papers, documents, vouchers, records, and books belonging to a public office or institution.\nFamily information liaison units will also provide centralized resources for families of missing or murdered indigenous women and girls and gather information during the inquiry process. \nFrom The Canadian Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEditor\u2019s Picks \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Unfinished Masterpieces Say to Living Artists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Tiny Pieces of Plastic in Our Oceans Are \u2018Terrifying\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducator Jeremy Tate: The Classics Can Help Us Build a Better Future\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nReceive Our Epoch 10 Newsletter\nImportant stories from around the world,in your inbox daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n \nMore in CanadaVancouver\u2019s Foreign Buyer Tax Won\u2019t Make Big Dent in Housing Affordability: ExpertsCanada in Brief, July 28 \u2013 Aug. 3Rio Olympics: Possible Canadian Medal WinnersCross-Canada Tour Puts Focus on Murder for Organs in China \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLatest in World\t\t \t\t\t\n\n \n Politics\nMother of UK Man Who Tried to \u2018Kill\u2019 Trump Bids for His Return\n\n\n Entertainment News\nUK Car Tragedy Band\u2019s Debut Album Released\n\n\n Asia & Pacific\nRestoring Medieval Tibetan Shrines in Nepal\u2019s Himalayas\n\n \n Asia & Pacific\nMongolian Wrestling Women Grapple With Tradition\n\n\n Europe\nIn Romania, a Play Shows Pain and Risk of Whistleblowers\n\n\n International\nUN Bungles Response to Africa\u2019s Yellow Fever Outbreak\n\n \n International\nRio Olympics Opening Ceremony Highlights Brazil, Environment\n\n\n Europe\nTurkish Ruling Party Purges Us-based Cleric\u2019s Followers\n\n\n Asia & Pacific\nGiant, Widening Sinkhole Opens Up in Australia\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\nAdvertise\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nPrint Editions\nRSS Feeds\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright Policy\n \n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2000-\n\n\n\n\n\nTop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs are criticizing how Winnipeg police investigated the death of a 22-year-old woman found unclothed in a train yard.

Jay Murray said officers conducted interviews, watched videos and used tracks in the snow to conclude that Vanderwal was alone in the rail yard and no criminal act was committed.\"Her death is a tragedy and we sympathize with the grief that her loved ones must feel at this time,\" Murray said.At some point that evening, Vanderwal went to the entrance of the rail line, dropped some personal items in the snow and made her way through a locked gate, Murray said. She then walked around the area for awhile before she was struck by a train.Murray said it's believed she was suffering from paradoxical undressing linked to lethal hypothermia and removed her clothing. She began to crawl along the tracks before she was hit by another train.Police were called to the area around 9 p.m. after train operators found her with serious injuries. She died in hospital.Manitoba First Nations Police Service officers notified the family in Sandy Bay First Nation, which Murray said is standard protocol for people who live outside the city.Natalie Beaulieu and Vanderwal's grandmother, Linda Beaulieu, said they were not shown compassion when they learned of the death. Vanderwal's aunt, Elyssa McIvor, said they also were not given adequate information about what happened.\"Jaeda deserved better treatment from the Winnipeg police. Instead from the beginning she was like many of our men and women who are thought of just as another Indigenous person who had substance abuse problems that led to their untimely deaths,\" she said. \"But we are more than that, we are human beings.\"Vanderwal, who was the mother of a two-year-old child, loved to laugh, her family said. Even when people were crying she would find a way to make them smile.Vanderwal called her mother on the morning of her death and always stayed in contact, her family said. McIvor said it would be completely out of character for her to go wander in a train yard alone.That's why the family said they were shocked when no one was contacted by investigators to talk about the hours prior to her death. McIvor said they've also been given information from other people who knew Vanderwal which they believe could be important to an investigation.She said when family reached out to police they were told to contact victim services or the medical examiner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the time of reconciliation, we Indigenous are no better off than when this word became a catchphrase,\" she said.Murray said the family contacted the victim service's unit. A meeting was arranged but the family didn't attend. He said any information that may show a crime was committed will be investigated.He said police Chief Danny Smyth is to meet with the family on Friday.Grand Chief Arlen Dumas of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs said her death is reminiscent of Tina Fontaine, a 15-year-old Indigenous girl whose body was found in a river wrapped in a duvet cover weighed down by rocks in 2014.He said it is important that police take the time to ensure that Vanderwal's family gets answers.\"I'm very shocked and dismayed that Jaeda's life and memory is being treated the way that it is being treated and I'm very disturbed that the family is not getting the support that they should receive.\"This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 16, 2020\n\n\n\nThe Canadian Press.

\"without a trace\" during the late 1990s and early 2000s when she worked as the co-ordinator of a sex workers' drop-in centre in Vancouver's notorious Downtown Eastside.\"There was just indifference all over the city,\" said Allan\u00a0in court transcripts about her\u00a0aggressive efforts to notify authorities. \"It was really a struggle.\"Fast forward to today and Allan, who is running for the Conservatives in the riding of Vancouver Centre, says she ardently opposes a national inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women.\n\n\nThe Tory candidate, who stepped down earlier this year as executive director of a homeless sector non-profit group, responded with a firm no when asked whether she sees a contradiction in her positions.\"I don't think we need another study,\" Allan said during an interview when asked about protesting a formal public inquiry into Canada's missing women.\"When it comes to vulnerable women and children we know what the problems are and now is the time to take action.\"Allan spoke by phone with The Canadian Press on the condition that\u00a0a Conservative communications person be patched into the call from Ottawa.\"We can no longer afford to wait,\" said Allan, outlining the need for more treatment beds, shelter funding and mental health and addiction programs.A national commission would cost taxpayers $100 million or more and last several years, she added.Wally Oppal, who headed the 2011 missing women commission, echoed Allan's sentiments last year by opposing calls for an inquiry, also insisting that now was the time to act.Allan personally knew five of the six women serial killer Robert Pickton was convicted of murdering and she testified at his trial in 2007.In 2014, RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson revealed that nearly 1,200 aboriginal women have been murdered or gone missing in Canada over the past three decades.A myriad of organizations\u00a0\u2014 from First Nations groups to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities\u00a0\u2014 have demanded the Conservatives move forward with a nation-wide investigation, despite the government's steadfast refusal.Both the New Democrats and Liberals have promised an inquiry if either wins the Oct. 19 federal election.As for prostitution, Allan toed the Tory line by advocating more police resources and stronger legislation, but she steered clear of specifying her position on whether sex workers themselves should be criminalized.On the topic of Insite, she expressed frustration with Vancouver's safe-injection facility, another lightning-rod topic closely associated with the Downtown Eastside.\"When (Insite) was introduced we were told that it would be only one of four pillars needed to effectively address addiction issues in our city, and so far the other pillars\u00a0\u2014 which are prevention, treatment and enforcement\u00a0\u2014 have been under funded, or in some cases ignored altogether,\" she said.\"Harm reduction on its own, which is the other pillar, isn't an effective strategy ... to effectively address high-risk drug use and addiction behaviour.\"Allan insisted more research is necessary to determine the site's effectiveness, despite a landmark 2011 Supreme Court decision that ruled Insite saved lives and improved health without increasing drug use and crime in the surrounding area.Still, the aspiring Conservative MP broke with standard Tory rhetoric demanding the facility be shut down outright.Asked about her decision to run for the Conservatives, Allan said she wanted to see more accountability and financial transparency in the non-profit sector, citing concern over both inefficiencies and fraud.\"I'd like to see better financial controls in place for the agencies that are receiving all this taxpayer money,\" she said. \"We're talking hundreds of millions of dollars annually. It's a lot of money.\"Vancouver Centre is shaping up to be a tight three-way race between the three major parties, mirroring the electoral landscape across the country.Incumbent Liberal MP Hedy Fry is vying for her eighth consecutive term representing the riding, while former Vancouver Park Board Chairwoman Constance Barnes is looking to claim the spot for the New Democrats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\ue007\n\n\n\t\t\t\t   Candidates Dropped From Canada Election 2015\t\t\t\t  \n\n\n\n\nof\n\n\n\ue000\n\n\n\ue001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liberal candidate in Victoria resigned after comments she made about mosques and Israel were discovered by a satirical news website.\n\nIn 2013, Thomas wrote on Facebook that mosques were once education centres but were now used \"as brainwashing stations.\"\n\n\n\nThe Conservative party's flagbearer in Mississauga-Malton was let go on Oct. 6 after a Canadian Press story discussed his defence of gay conversion therapies.\n\nGrewal had penned an editorial for the Punjabi Post, titled \"Is it wrong for a homosexual to become a normal person?\"\n\n\n\nSandra Arias told The Canadian Press that she pulled out of the race over what she says is the financial pressure of a historically long campaign.\n\nArias was running in the riding of Battlefords-Lloydminster, which is currently held by Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz, who took 67 per cent of the votes in the last federal election.\n\n\n\nStefan Jonasson, a Unitarian minister, dropped out as the NDP candidate in the riding of Charleswood-St. James-Assiniboia-Headingly after it emerged that he compared the actions of an Orthodox Jewish group to the Taliban on social media.\n\n\n\nMaria Manna stepped down as the candidate in the B.C. riding of Cowichan-Malahat-Langford after she questioned the official account of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on her Facebook page, reported CBC News.\n\n\n\nOn Sept. 16, the Liberals announced they had ended Austin's candidacy for views that were \"irreconcilable\" with the party, according to The Canadian Press.\n\nA Twitter account bearing the same name posted a link to a video of last year's Parliament Hill shooting, writing, \"Harper has turned our Nation's Capital into a War Zone as his thirst for War.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe ex-Conservative candidate made a splash in headlines on Sept. 6 after footage of Bance peeing into a mug then emptying it into a sink resurfaced.

Breen Ouellette says that he believes the federal government has \u201cundermined the independence and impartiality of the national inquiry.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0(Andrew Vaughan / THE CANADIAN PRESS)Breen, who is Metis, says in the statement that he believes the federal government has \u201cundermined the independence and impartiality of the national inquiry\u201d and that he cannot remain part of a process that he says \u201cis speeding towards failure.\u201dHe also asks the inquiry\u2019s commissioners to allow him to fully disclose the reasons behind his resignation, which he says he cannot do as a lawyer.The inquiry has been plagued by chronic delays, staff turnover and complaints from families about disorganization, poor communication and a lack of transparency.Article Continued BelowNadine Gros-Louis, a spokesperson for the inquiry, confirmed in an email that Ouellette has stepped down, noting that staffing changes do occur.Read more: RCMP Commissioner apologizes to families of missing and murdered Indigenous womenMMIWG inquiry gets six-month deadline extension to finish its workOttawa not ready to create special police task force for missing and murdered Indigenous women\u201cAs you can appreciate, and as with all organizations, staffing does not remain constant, especially in an environment dealing with difficult subject matter where many staff work extended hours,\u201d Gros-Louis wrote.Breen\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t mention long hours. As an example of government interference, though, he said the inquiry needs to be able to properly investigate allegations of \u201cillegal and improper\u201d foster-care apprehensions.Article Continued Below\u201cThe national inquiry could use its powers to force government departments to comply with investigations into these allegations. The perpetrators could be identified so that governments could stop the misuse of billions of Canadian tax dollars by a few heartless bureaucrats seeking to advance their careers,\u201d Breen wrote.\u201cHowever, interference by the federal government is undermining this important function of the national inquiry. Canadians deserve to know which provinces and territories perpetuate this unnecessary and harmful spending of billions of tax dollars on foster-care apprehensions.\u201dLast month, the government turned down a request by inquiry officials for a two-year extension in order to give commissioners until Dec. 31, 2020, to make recommendations and produce findings.Instead, the government agreed to only extend the inquiry\u2019s deadline by another six months. That gives commissioners until next April 30 to finish its hearings and submit a final report, instead of the initial deadline of Nov. 1 of this year.Reached late Monday, Breen said the refusal to grant the two-year-extension, along with the funding for it, shows the government isn\u2019t serious about the commissioners meeting the inquiry\u2019s mandate.\u201cThey\u2019re trying to kill the national inquiry in a death by a thousand cuts, and they\u2019re trying to pin the failure on the commissioners,\u201d Breen said in a phone interview from Vancouver.Carolyn Bennett, minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, explained the decision to extend the mandate by just six months was made in part because provinces and territories were not unanimously supportive of extending the terms of reference for the inquiry into next year.Gros-Louis, meanwhile, said the inquiry remains independent and impartial.\u201cWith diverse backgrounds, experience and expertise, we are united by a deep commitment to honour the missing and murdered, uncover the truth and build a better future for Indigenous women and girls,\u201d she wrote.Read more about: VancouverTOP STORIES, DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX.NEW NEWSLETTERHEADLINESSIGN UPMore from The Star & PartnersLOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Copyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.

Although Dawn's DNA was found at the Pickton farm, the convicted killer was never charged with her murder.\n\"I don't plan on sitting on the sidelines of the inquiry pounding on a drum and complaining about the terms of reference. I plan to be there to offer up what I can to help,\" he said.\nThe inquiry, which acknowledges MMIW as a \"national tragedy that must be brought to an end\" aims to get to the roots of systemic violence against First Nations women and girls, looking at elements like the impact of Indian Act, and the history of colonialism.\nCrey hopes everyone will support it, including aboriginal leaders, and help rally the families of the missing with supporters, and get behind this inquiry.\n\"The idea is to work with it as it is and make it a success,\" he said.\nThe MMIW inquiry is scheduled to begin on Sept. 1, is expected to last at least two years and cost at least $53.8 million.\n\"What do I want from the inquiry? It's pretty simple. I want the inquiry to canvass all the issues they've listed in the terms of reference, and do a thorough job of them.\"\nIdeally it would be held in a variety of locations, including big cities and small communities.\nBut the real work will happen at the end of it.\n\"As difficult and challenging as the inquiry will be, the real work will start with the recommendations, and they will be be compelling the provinces, territories and Ottawa, to take the recommendations, and use them to inform their policies around First Nations, women, children and families.\"\nThe commissioners include: the Honourable Marion R. Buller as Chief Commissioner, Mich\u00e8le Ta\u00efna Audette, E. Qajaq Robinson, Marilyn Poitras and Brian Eyolfson.\nCrey said he personally knows two of the commissioners, Buller and Audette, which gives him comfort due to their high levels of intelligence, integrity and compassion.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

No reason for the departure was given.The resignation follows that in late June of executive director Michele Moreau, who cited personal reasons.\n\u201c\u200eWe \u200ewant \u200eto reassure the public that now, more than ever, we remain focused on this tremendously important \u200ework,\u201d\u200e Chief\u200e Commissioner \u200eMarion Buller said in a statement.\u200eIndigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett said the government would discuss whether the inquiry, which is due to issue an interim report in the fall, can continue with reduced staffing.\n\"That is a conversation that we will have here in government, as well as to hear from the commission,\" Bennett told reporters outside parliament.\"Yesterday the commission felt they were more than prepared to go forward as four commissioners ... but ultimately it will be up to government to decide, in consultation, as to what the next step will be.\"Trudeau came to power pledging to fix the relationship with aboriginals, who make up about 4 percent of the country's population. But two years later many accuse his Liberal government of not doing enough to help impoverished communities, and protests by indigenous people disrupted the nation's July 1 Canada Day festivities.

Trudeau outlined the government\u2019s steps to address the inquiry\u2019s 231 calls to justice on June 3, 2021, which include funding commitments and initiatives in culture, health and wellness, human safety, security and justice.\n\nThe plan does include $2.2 billion in new spending initiatives, but doesn\u2019t include an actual timeline for the work to begin. Indigenous-Crown Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett says she\u2019ll announce further details later this year.\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\nLocal reactions from MMIWG report\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal family grateful for Ronald McDonald House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest in Local News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$1.5 million for 10 NWO communities \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily members of long term care loved ones reunited after 15 months\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 13: Zero cases of COVID-19 reported\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeaver Brae adding new Land-Based Learning Program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest stories on KenoraOnline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGussy finishes 21st in Bassmaster Classic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal family grateful for Ronald McDonald House\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig comeback for Gussy as he qualifies for day 3 of Bassmaster Classic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatiowski Farmers' Market returns for 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Local Events\n\n\n\n\nMon, Jun 14,  8:00 AM\n\n\nAlzheimer Society Catch the Ace\n\n\n\n\nWed, Jun 16,  8:30 AM\n\n\nMatiowski Farmers' Market\n\n\n\n\nFri, Jun 18,  7:30 PM\n\n\nMeditation Fridays\n\n\n\n\nSun, Jun 20, 11:00 AM\n\n\nSt. Andrews United Church Keewatin - Online Sunday Worship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListen Live\nGet the App\n\n\n\n\nLocal News\nCommunity\nLocal Sports\nFuneral Announcements\nWeather\nEvents\nLocalJobShop\nHelloGoodBuy Classifieds\nGarage Sales\nCOVID-19\nStorm Tracker\n\n\n\nConnect\n\nContact Us\nSubmit News\nMeet the Team\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\nStreaming\nRSS\nAdvertise With Us\nCareers\nContest Rules\nTerms Of Use Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2021 Golden West Broadcasting.

De voorbije decennia werden meer dan 1.200 dossiers geopend van gedode of vermiste vrouwen die deel uitmaken van de oorspronkelijke bevolkingsgroepen in het land. De minister van Autochtone Zaken, Carolyn Bennett, geeft nu toe dat de politie die onderzoeken mogelijk slecht heeft aangepakt. Bovendien zou het aantal verdachte zaken ook hoger liggen dan de 1.200 dossiers. \u201cDe omvang van deze tragedie is veel groter dan gedacht\u201d, aldus Bennett.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEind vorig jaar maakte de nieuwe Canadese regering onder leiding van Justin Trudeau bekend dat ze een nationaal onderzoek gaat opstarten naar de vele gevallen van geweld tegen vrouwen van de inheemse gemeenschap. De nationale politie telde in 2014 bijna 1.200 dossiers van gedode of vermiste vrouwen uit de M\u00e9nuit- en Inuit-gemeenschap. Het gaat over feiten die zich afspeelden tussen 1980 en 2012. Ook in een dit jaar gepubliceerd VN-rapport wordt aangeklaagd dat de inheemse vrouwen vijf keer meer kans maken om met geweld geconfronteerd te worden.Veel van de doden werden geklasseerd als zelfmoord of natuurlijk overlijden, de politie voerde amper een onderzoek. Volgens een vrouwenorganisatie zou het aantal vrouwen dat vermoord werd of verdwenen is op 4.000 liggen. \u201cHet is duidelijk dat vele families een heropening van het onderzoek vragen\u201d, verklaarde minister Bennett. Ze verwees naar het geval van een vrouw met een schotwonde in de nek, en een andere wiens handen op haar rug gebonden waren. Beide zaken werden bestempeld als zelfmoord.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

The act undermined, and continues to undermine, First Nations cultural and social systems. It disempowered First Nations women by replacing First Nations governance systems, and did not allow them to vote or run for office in the imposed band council system. The act eliminated the right of First Nations women to reside in their community, or have any rights, if they married men who did not have \u201cstatus\u201d as an \u201cIndian\u201d under the act. Conversely, the act granted status to non-Indigenous women who married men who had status under the act.\nEarly 1900s to present day \u2014 Indigenous women experienced forced sterilization in Canadian hospitals.

Stu Neatby\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nA\n\n\n\n\nCHARLOTTETOWN, P.E.I. \u2014 \nOne year after the release of the final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG), Premier Dennis King has released an update on the province\u2019s progress on its recommendations.\u00a0\nOn Friday, the premier tabled a status report on the 231 recommendations of the inquiry that related to P.E.I. and tabled another status report detailing progress on the 94 recommendations from the 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\nBoth reports contained detailed and comprehensive information on actions taken in government departments and are reflective of significant work undertaken by the current government to address the injustices of Canada and P.E.I.\u2019s history with Indigenous people.\nBut neither report includes specific information on how many of the recommendations from either the inquiry or the commission the province believes it has implemented to date.\nKing presented the reports in advance of National Indigenous Peoples Day, which will took place on Sunday, June 21.\n\u201cI encourage all Islanders to take this time to understand more about the history and let it inform your actions,\u201d King told the House.\n\u201cCelebrate the Mi\u2019kmaq and Indigenous people but learn from them as well.\u201d\nThe reports were tabled hours before a Healing Walk was scheduled to take place in front of the Coles Building, to mark the death of Chantel Moore, a Nuu-chah-nulth woman, and Rodney Levi, a Metepenagiag First Nation man. Both were shot and killed after separate encounters with RCMP in New Brunswick.\n\n\nHundreds attended an Indigenous Lives Matter walk in Charlottetown on June 19.\n\n\u00a0\nThe MMIWG report included 231 calls for justice. Fourteen individuals from P.E.I. participated in the inquiry, which found that Indigenous women and girls are more likely to experience violence or be murdered than non-Indigenous women and girls.\n\nIn the province\u2019s status report on these recommendation, provincial staff noted that work on the recommendations requires work across all provincial departments. In March 2020, the province\u2019s executive council established an interdepartmental working group, which would work with an Indigenous working group.\nThe status report says the interdepartmental working group will present an annual report of \u201cthe government of P.E.I.\u2019s actions to move the Calls for Justice forward.\u201d\u00a0\n\nExamples of steps taken to address the 231 calls for justice include:\n\nContinued funding for family information liaison units, which assisted families in obtaining police reports, court records and autopsy reports.\u00a0\nIncreased funding for an Indigenous justice program, administered by MCPEI.\nPlans to fund a Mi\u2019kmaq Language initiative, which will help produce video or print material in the Mi\u2019kmaq language.\nA pilot project involving students from Stonepark Intermediate, Mount Stewart Consolidated and Ecole Franscois-Buote to gather at the Abegweit First Nation and \u201cstart the working progress of reconciliation.\u201d\nThe establishment of an independent child and youth advocate office in November 2019.\nFunding for development of temporary housing for off-reserve Indigenous people.\nFunding from the province for constructing the Urban Indigenous Centre on the Charlottetown waterfront.\n\n\nP.E.I.\u2019s status report on the TRC contained 44 pages detailing information on each of the commission\u2019s 94 calls to action. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission documented the legacy of residential schools in Canada.\nThe TRC status report included information about reforms undertaken in child protection, education, health care and justice intended to address inequities experienced by Indigenous people.\u00a0\nAs one example, the Mi\u2019kmaq Confederacy of P.E.I. provides ongoing training with the Atlantic Police Academy about Mi\u2019kmaq history and the impacts of residential schools.\u00a0\nFunding for an Indigneous Courtwork Program was announced in the recent provincial budget.\u00a0\nHowever, the report also notes that the province lacks specific data collection on the degree of overrepresentation of Indigenous people in custody. The report notes that an \u201cautomated offender management information system\u201d is under development.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nUpdate on P.E.I.'s progress on the MMIWG Recommendations\nUpdate on P.E.I.'s progress on TRC recommendations\n\n\nTwitter.com/stu_neatby\nRELATED:\n\n\n\n                 \n\n            \n            \n            Hundreds speak up during peaceful Indigenous Lives Matter walk in Charlottetown\n\n\n\n            \n            \n            INDIGENOUS PEOPLES DAY: Celebrating Canada's first peoples\n\n\n\n                 \n\n            \n            \n            P.E.I.

That report came days after a United Nations watchdog called for an inquiry into Canada's missing and murdered indigenous women.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrudeau has made working with the aboriginal community to rectify ongoing issues a priority. He said those touched by the tragedy of murdered and missing aboriginal women have waited long enough.\"The victims deserve justice, their families an opportunity to heal and to be heard,\" he said during a speech Tuesday. \"We must work together to put an end to this ongoing tragedy.\"Last year's Royal Canadian Mounted Police report said aboriginal women represent 4.3 percent of the total female population but that 16 percent of all female homicide victims are from First Nations, as Canada's indigenous people are called.The police reviewed cases from 1980 to 2013 and found 1,181 aboriginal women fell into the missing or murdered category \u2014 almost double earlier estimates. Of those 1,181 women, 164 were missing and 1,017 murdered.Trudeau received a standing ovation after speaking at the Assembly of First Nations Special Chiefs Assembly in Gatineau, Quebec. He is the first prime minister in recent memory to attend the event hosted by the Assembly of First Nations. The national advocacy organization represents aboriginal communities, which includes more than 900,000 people living in 634 First Nation communities across the country.\"You have made a great start in changing the relationship, Prime Minister,\" said Perry Bellegarde, the National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations. \"I see that change has already begun,\"Under Harper, the Canadian government had tense relations with the aboriginal community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                More from this section\n                \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n            Fire marshal investigates RV fire in Fairhope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n +5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n            South Korea, India plan to double bilateral trade by 2030\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n +5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n            California firefighter slaying suspect appears in court\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne sore point has been how to deal with the legacy of residential schools. Some 150,000 First Nations, Inuit and Metis children were taken from their families and forced to attend government schools over much of the last century. The children were not allowed to speak their native languages and were forced to convert to Christianity. Many were beaten, verbally abused and up to 6,000 were said to have died.Harper made a historic apology in 2008 to residential school survivors.But he has been faulted for failing to implement the recommendations of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to reduce the number of indigenous children in state care, eliminate gaps in education and employment, protect indigenous languages and launch a probe into murdered and missing aboriginal women.Trudeau said Tuesday that his government would implement all 94 recommendations from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\"What's needed is nothing less than a total renewal between Canada and First Nations people,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nGeneral News\n \nMissing Persons\n \nNative Americans\n \nGovernment And Politics\n \nViolent Crime\n \nCrime\n \n\n\nLocations\n\nCanada\n \nOntario\n \nNorth America\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                Latest e-Edition\n                \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n\n        \n            The Bradford Era\n\n\n\nTo view our latest e-Edition click the image on the left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSix-day home delivery for as little as $17.00/monthIncludes our e-Edition at no extra cost!\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Bradford, PA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight Now\n76\u00b0\nFair\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumidity: 62%\nFeels Like: 76\u00b0\nHeat Index: 76\u00b0\nWind:  7 mph\nWind Chill: 76\u00b0\n\n\n\n\nUV Index: 8 Very High\nSunrise: 05:48:56 AM\nSunset: 08:51:02 PM\nDew Point: 76\u00b0\nVisibility: 10 mi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday\nPartly cloudy.

(b) review its legislation at the federal, provincial and territorial levels, and coordinate police responses across the country, with a view to preventing the occurrence of such murders and disappearances; (c) investigate, prosecute, and punish the perpetrators and provide reparation to victims; and (d) address the root causes of violence against indigenous women and girls,\u201d stated the report.\n \nMore Syrian refugees to Canada\nBut Mulcair and his rivals also face pressure of a different kind: that of four million Syrian war refugees, many of whom are streaming into Europe in their thousands, while some have Canada in mind as a safe haven.\nMulcair said Canadians need a \"Prime minister who understands the urgency to act as crises unfold\" and said Canada under the NDP would welcome 46,000 Syrian refugees over the next four years, thereby fulfilling its United Nations obligations.\nSo far, less than 2,400 Syrians have been admitted into Canada since civil war first broke out in 2011.\nGermany by contrast is expecting to take in 800,000 refugees by the end of this year and many have already made the hazardous journey through Turkey, the Balkans, and central Europe to reach sanctuary, braving rough seas, hostile border guards, and hunger to escape their war-torn country. \n \nTalk of a greener future\u2026but no promises just two months before Paris talks\n\n\n\n\nOn climate change, Mulcair did not list specific actions, but said he would improve Canada's policies on climate change, which many argue have stalled since Stephen Harper took office.\n\"I believe in taking action on climate change today, so we don't leave an environmental debt to our children,\" said Mulcair.\nMulcair once again avoided committing to any concrete greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, just two months before the Conference of Parties (COP) 21 talks in Paris are due to begin.\nSpeaking at the Aug. 6 Leaders\u2019 Debate in Toronto, Mulcair vowed to play a constructive role in Paris if elected prime minister, but did not mention any emissions target.\nBut the NDP has promised to shift federal subsidies from oil sands industries to renewable energy and clean technology development, as well as taxing polluters for the environmental damage they cause.\nMulcair has also promised proper consultation and study before approving any major energy project such as Kinder Morgan\u2019s proposed Trans Mountain expansion between Edmonton and Burnaby.\nA leg-up for the poor and seniors\nReturning to more \u2018bread and butter\u2019 domestic issues, Mulcair restated his party\u2019s promise to roll out a $15 minimum wage to help lift working families out of poverty, alongside new taxes for the wealthy.\n\u201cI stand for a $15 minimum wage,\u201d said Mulcair, adding that people working full-time hours should not have to live in poverty.\nMulcair also promised that if an NDP government were elected, he would close a tax loophole loophole so that the wealthy would contribute tax dollars toward programs for feeding hungry children.\n\"Just a few months ago at the Broadbent Institute I got a chance to talk about tax loopholes, and the rich. Right now, there are a select few who benefit from a tax loophole for stock options. At the same time, in our country, hundreds of thousands of children will go to school without having eaten.\"\nThe NDP leader then attacked Harper for cutting federal health transfers, also taking a swipe at his Liberal predecessors for slashing billion in such transfers during the 1990s.\nMulcair also made his pitch to seniors and those Canadians struggling to access affordable medicines and mental health care.\n\"We're going to be focusing on four key elements - improving care for seniors, improving access to care at home, a comprehensive national strategy on mental health, and reducing the cost of medication,\u201d said Mulcair to cheers. \u201cWe will relieve pressure on overcrowded hospitals so they can provide emergency care to those who need it most.\u201d\nWith files from Jenny Uechi\n\n\n\n\nShare this article.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterFacebook Like\n\n\n\nSeptember 13th 2015Fram Dinshaw\n\n\n\nPolitics, Canada's 2015 Federal Election Campaign, Thomas Mulcair, missing and murdered aboriginal women, Syrian refugee crisis, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, News\n\n\n\n\nToday's must read \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the National Observer.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan Hayward\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\tGATINEAU, Que. - The families of missing or murdered indigenous women and girls are being promised they will now have someone to turn to when they need help navigating the justice system.\n\n\t\"Some of the families of the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls told us they wanted to know more about what happened to their loved ones, but found it hard to get the information,\" Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould said Wednesday as the Liberal government unveiled the details of their promised national inquiry.\n\n\tThe federal justice department is devoting $11.7 million over three years so that provinces and territories can establish family information liaison units within their existing victims services departments.\n\n\tAnother $4.5 million to support victims services projects giving direct help to the families of missing or murdered indigenous women and girls.\n\n\t\"These units will help families deal with the trauma of their loss and help them connect to the resources that they require,\" Wilson-Raybould said.\n\n\tThat would include helping families get more details of the investigation \u2014 or, when that's not possible, explain to them why that is the case.\n\n\tBernadette Smith said families need all the help they can get.\n\n\tSmith said when her sister, Claudette Osborne, went missing from Winnipeg in 2008, the police gave them little more than a file number.\n\n\t\"We had to get political and pressure the police to do their job,\" she said. \"No family should have to do that.\"\n\n\tOthers pointed out that what families really want is the opportunity to reopen cases they feel were not handled properly the first time around, such as deaths determined to be accidents that they believe were actually homicides.\n\n\t\"Families are not looking for mainstream counselling services through victims' services, but justice,\" said Dawn Lavell-Harvard, president of the Native Women's Association of Canada.\n\n\tHer organization had called for an independent review mechanism that would be overseen by the inquiry.\n\n\tWilson-Raybould said the commissioners will have the power to refer information they receive regarding criminal investigations or allegations of misconduct to the appropriate authorities.\n\n\t\"They also, in doing so, have the ability to provide oversight and watch what happens to the referrals that they make,\" she said.\n\n\tIndigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett noted a public inquiry does not have the power to find criminal wrongdoing. Further, she said, families told the government during pre-inquiry consultations that they did not want the inquiry run like a courtroom.\n\n\t\"What we were told is that unlike other commissions, people don't want rooms full of lawyers sorting things out in an adversarial way,\" Bennett said.\n\n\t\u2014 With files from Kristy Kirkup @kkirkup on Twitter\n\n\t\u2014 Follow @smithjoanna on Twitter\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2016 Prince George Citizen\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail to a Friend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Email Address: *\n\n\nYour Name: *\n\n\nTo Email Address: *\n\n\nMessage: *\n\n\n\n* Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext\nUnemployment rate 7.7 per cent last month\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up For Our e-Newsletter!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCity Matters\n\nYour City Matters - City of Prince George\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Citizen\n\n\n\nMost Read\nMost Recent\nYou Might Like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLocal linen business in lather as city awards contract to American outfit\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSevere thunderstorm watch\n\nAugust 5, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNorth facing physiotherapy shortage\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHighway reopened following collision\n\nAugust 5, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCanfor hosting free breakfast on Saturday\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nProvince has no \u0091Plan B\u0092 if LNG development fails\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLocal woman featured in Maclean's Canada's Stories\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNess Lake and a community in conversation\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLawsuit filed over collision with dead moose at accident scene\n\nAugust 3, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHard-hit town facing gas utility increases\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nUnemployment rate 7.7 per cent last month\n\nAugust 5, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSevere thunderstorm watch\n\nAugust 5, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHighway reopened following collision\n\nAugust 5, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNorthern Capitals\u0092 auditions begin today\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nJobs up for grabs at Cariboo Cats' camp\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPGARA pioneer passes away\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFinns finish Paciejewski\u0092s playoff run in Budapest\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nHot pitcher knocks Knights out of the saddle\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEntrapment ineptitude\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nRetire the rings\n\nAugust 4, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill & Kate POLL\nPrince William and his wife Kate will be visiting B.C. this fall.

Women hold signs during the closing ceremony of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada, June 3, 2019. REUTERS/Chris WattieThe 1,200-page report, which resulted from an inquiry launched by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government in 2016, blamed the violence on long-standing discrimination against indigenous people and Canada\u2019s failure to protect them. It also made sweeping recommendations to prevent future violence against indigenous women. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police revealed in 2014 that 1,017 aboriginal women had been murdered between 1980 and 2012. The inquiry, which was beset by delays and staff resignations, opened painful wounds as it heard testimony from 468 family members of missing or murdered women.  \u201cThis colonialism, this discrimination and this genocide explains the high rates of violence against indigenous women, girls, 2SLGBTQQIA people,\u201d Marion Buller, the chief commissioner of the inquiry, said at a ceremony held to present the report. The 2SLGBTQQIA group refers to two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex and asexual people. \u201cAn absolute paradigm shift is required to dismantle colonialism in Canadian society. And this paradigm shift must come from all levels of government and public institutions,\u201d Buller said.  The final report, called \u201cReclaiming Power and Place,\u201d was presented during an often emotional ceremony in Gatineau, Quebec, near the Canadian capital, and was attended by some of the hundreds of family members of those missing or murdered, and by government officials including Trudeau. While aboriginal people account for only about 4 percent of Canada\u2019s population, they on average suffer from higher rates of crime, poverty and addiction. Danielle Ewenin, whose sister\u2019s mysterious death remains unresolved, said indigenous women live in fear. \u201cToday, when I go somewhere, I\u2019m afraid, and it\u2019s a fear that we all carry every day and you get so used to it that it\u2019s like it\u2019s part of you,\u201d she said in testimony included in the final report. \u201cI have seven daughters and lots of granddaughters that I worry about constantly all day. I don\u2019t want them to become a statistic.\u201d \u2018LIVES ARE AT STAKE\u2019 Trudeau made Canada\u2019s reconciliation for its colonial past a major plank of his 2015 campaign, and he has apologized for some of the country\u2019s historical wrongs since taking office. Last month, he posthumously exonerated a Cree chief unjustly imprisoned for treason more than 130 years ago. \u201cTo the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls of Canada, to their families, and to survivors - we have failed you. But we will fail you no longer,\u201d Trudeau said, promising a national action plan to address the violence going forward. Slideshow (5 Images)\u201cTo the survivors and families here today, and to those watching or listening at home, I want you to know that this report is not the end,\u201d he added. Perry Bellegarde, who heads the Assembly of First Nations, the umbrella group for the more than 600 aboriginal bands in Canada, urged immediate action on the back of the report. \u201cLives are at stake. We cannot wait any longer for real action and real results to ensure the respect, safety and security of all First Nations at risk, and these efforts must be in coordination with survivors and families,\u201d Bellegarde said.

The cases were prosecuted in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, with the cities of Vancouver, Prince George, Saskatoon and Winnipeg most commonly listed as the woman\u2019s last place of residence. Eight serial killers, who were convicted in a total of 25 homicides, were responsible for the women\u2019s deaths.\nAboriginal women are being killed and disappearing across the country at an alarming rate. The RCMP have said 70 per cent of the indigenous women slain in Canada meet their fate at the hands of an indigenous person. In a report earlier this year, the federal force stated that indigenous women knew the offender in all solved homicides over the previous two years. It also emphasized the \u201cstrong nexus to family violence.\u201d\n\nBut that is not the whole story.\nAbout one-fifth of Canada\u2019s known female serial-homicide victims since 1980 were indigenous, according to a Globe analysis of convictions in an American researcher\u2019s international database; just 4 per cent of the overall Canadian female population is indigenous. The newspaper is also compiling and vetting its own database of homicide and long-term missing-person cases that involve indigenous women, building on data collected by the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada (NWAC) and Ottawa-based researcher Maryanne Pearce. Through this ongoing work, The Globe has determined that at least 18 indigenous women were slain by convicted serial killers since 1980.\nIf the scope is broadened to include cases with a probable suspect (those tied to Robert Pickton through stayed charges or DNA found on his farm, for example), then the number rises to about 35. And if the scope is further expanded to include speculative cases, for which court proceedings are pending or police have said a serial killer may be at work (along stretches of certain B.C. highways and in the Edmonton area, for instance), the number rises dramatically, to about 77.\nDawn Lavell-Harvard, the president of NWAC, said that while family violence is part of the problem, vulnerable indigenous women are being \u201ctargeted\u201d in urban centres by killers confident they will get away with it. \u201cWe need to expose the truth, so we can be effective in dealing with reality,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be basing our responses on urban myths or stereotypes.\u201d She said she would like to see the federal government create national legislation that mandates certain basic police standards relating to missing-person investigations.\nIn August, Canada\u2019s latest known serial killer, a non-indigenous man named Traigo Andretti, was convicted of murder for the second time. Both of his victims \u2013 Myrna Letandre in Manitoba and Jennifer McPherson in B.C. \u2013 were indigenous. He found Ms. Letandre through her sister, Lorna Sinclair, whom he met in an unusual way. Ms. Sinclair had signed up for a free voicemail service that allows people who do not have a phone, and are seeking work, to receive messages from prospective employers. Mr. Andretti exploited the service by dialling random extensions and, if a woman \u201csounded cute,\u201d he would leave a message, according to police transcripts obtained by The Globe. Ms. Sinclair introduced him to Ms. Letandre, who disappeared weeks later. She was considered missing for nearly seven years, until Mr. Andretti struck again and confessed to both murders.\nIndigenous leaders have long called for a national inquiry into violence against aboriginal women and girls, citing the need to examine historic and modern issues such as colonization, residential schools, the child-welfare system, poverty, drug abuse, street sex work, inadequate housing and racism. Proponents also want to shine a light on the way police handle unsolved homicide and missing-person cases involving indigenous women. The former Conservative government dismissed calls for a national inquiry, with one then-cabinet minister attributing the violence to a lack of respect among indigenous men for indigenous women on reserves. The new Liberal government, meanwhile, has committed to launching an inquiry by the summer.\nAn unprecedented 2014 RCMP report found 1,181 aboriginal females were killed or went missing across the country between 1980 and 2012. In an update last year, the Mounties said there were 32 additional homicides of indigenous women in 2013 and 2014 in RCMP jurisdictions. RCMP spokesman Sergeant Harold Pfleiderer said in an e-mail that the force did not conduct an analysis of serial homicide data for the reports, neither of which mention serial killing.\nVictims\u2019 stories\nThe serial killings of Ms. Letandre, Ms. McPherson and the 16 other indigenous women provide a window into the broader tragedy of violence against indigenous women in Canada. On Tuesday, The Globe is launching The Taken, a multimedia project that traces the lives of five of the women \u2013 Ms. Letandre, Cynthia Maas, Sereena Abotsway, Shelley Napope and Carolyn Sinclair \u2013 and explores the factors contributing to their vulnerability. These include difficulty transitioning to life in the city, the child-welfare system and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Their stories also examine the families\u2019 interactions with police and the justice system.\nThe RCMP do not have their own definition of serial homicide, but rather use a definition of \u201cserial murder\u201d crafted by experts convened by the FBI in 2005: \u201cThe unlawful killing of two or more victims by the same offender(s), in separate events.\u201d The Globe used the FBI\u2019s definition to define serial homicide, and included manslaughter because it is a form of unlawful killing.\nSgt. Pfleiderer said the RCMP were focusing their \u201cprevention and intervention efforts on family violence and youth empowerment in order to reduce and eliminate violence against indigenous women.\u201d He added that federal funding has been dedicated to programs aimed at addressing family violence in \u201cvulnerable indigenous communities.\u201d Last year, the RCMP told The Globe they had homed in on 10 communities, six of which are in Saskatchewan, two in Manitoba, and one each in B.C. and the Northwest Territories.\nIn April, The Globe filed an access-to-information request for the RCMP\u2019s list of 10 communities. The force at first said it could not locate the list, which The Globe did not accept. The request was reopened and, in July, the Mounties responded that the \u201crecords located\u201d qualified for an Access to Information Act exemption pertaining to law enforcement. The Globe has filed an appeal. Also in April, the newspaper requested the RCMP\u2019s list of indigenous female homicide victims, but the force required an extension and has yet to provide the names.\nGiven the lack of comprehensive Canadian data related to serial homicide, The Globe looked to the work of American researcher Mike Aamodt, who has compiled an international dataset of serial killings. An analysis of the Canadian convictions he has listed showed that indigenous women are roughly seven times more likely than non-indigenous women to be victims of serial homicide. \u201cAboriginal women are certainly overrepresented among the victims of Canadian serial killers,\u201d said Enzo Yaksic, who collaborates with Dr. Aamodt and has studied serial homicide for more than a decade.\nThe extent of that overrepresentation shocked the sister of Cynthia Maas, who was slain in 2010 by B.C. serial killer Cody Legebokoff (he filed an appeal earlier this year of four first-degree murder convictions). \u201cIt\u2019s very scary,\u201d Judy Maas said. \u201cIt\u2019s especially scary for my daughters, my granddaughters and all the young people coming down the road. \u2026 I\u2019m just thinking about the implications of that \u2013 the impact.\u201d\nVulnerable targets\nWhen it comes to the 18 serial-homicide cases compiled and confirmed by The Globe, many of the women, ranging in age from 13 to 41, were killed in or near cities. The majority were First Nations, while at least two were M\u00e9tis. Many of the women were either known or believed to have been engaged in sex work, though it is unclear, in several instances, whether that was true around the time of the killing. \u201cIt\u2019s a low-risk way to select a victim,\u201d said Mark Safarik, a retired special agent who worked in the FBI\u2019s behavioural analysis unit as a criminal profiler. He added that serial killers tend to select targets who meet two primary criteria: availability and vulnerability.\nIn further analyzing the 18 cases, there were also findings related to the eight killers, five of whom are non-indigenous. In the cases of Mr. Andretti, Winnipeg\u2019s Shawn Lamb and Saskatoon\u2019s John Crawford, every one of their known victims \u2013 a total of eight \u2013 was indigenous. The relationship between the victim and her killer was not always known or clear. While the death of Ms. McPherson might well be classified by some as \u201cfamily violence,\u201d since she was Mr. Andretti\u2019s wife at the time of her death, he was already a killer by the time they wed. There were also instances in which the perpetrator was believed to be a stranger.\n\u201cBy stating that the problem is rooted in family violence, the police are deflecting attention away from the broader problem of stranger victimizations because they cannot get a handle on it,\u201d Mr. Yaksic said.\nPolice forces and communities across Canada have long faced the reality \u2013 or the widespread, haunting speculation \u2013 of serial predation. In the 1980s, B.C.\u2019s Clifford Olson confessed to murdering 11 children. That case helped spur the creation of a central database to find links between violent crimes across the country. Robert Pickton\u2019s serial killings triggered an inquiry that deemed police investigations into disappearances from Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside between 1997 and 2002 to be \u201cblatant failures.\u201d\nCommissioner of Inquiry Wally Oppal made dozens of recommendations in 2012, but some have yet to be fully implemented, including the development of a safe-travel option for people living along the so-called Highway of Tears in Northern B.C., where women have been dying or disappearing at an alarming rate in recent decades. He said he believes police communication across jurisdictions has improved, and he commends the province for introducing new legislation that gives law enforcement greater powers to obtain personal information, including health and telephone records, related to a vulnerable missing person.\nThe former B.C. attorney-general believes much more needs to be done to address the social factors that lead to increased vulnerability, such as poverty, unstable housing, drug addiction and sex work. \u201cThe conditions [in the Downtown Eastside] need to be addressed in a major way because that could be a breeding ground for another serial killer [to find victims],\u201d Mr. Oppal said.\nSuccess breeds arrogance\nOver the past several years, the RCMP have struck task forces across the country to review unsolved homicides and missing-person cases. The E-PANA task force was created a decade ago to determine if one or more serial killers was responsible for the deaths and disappearances of young women travelling along certain major highways in B.C. Two of the task force\u2019s 18 cases, dating from 1969 to 2006, are considered solved, though the RCMP have said a now-deceased American felon is suspected in two more homicides and is a person of interest in several other cases.\nMr. Andretti\u2019s conviction was the first one stemming from Manitoba\u2019s Project Devote, a joint RCMP and Winnipeg Police Service task force launched in 2012. It is investigating more than two dozen homicide and long-term missing-person cases, many of which involve indigenous women. Mr. Andretti confessed his crimes to the RCMP in B.C. and, after he pleaded guilty there in relation to Ms. McPherson\u2019s murder, he was transferred as a sentenced prisoner to Winnipeg and pleaded guilty to killing Ms. Letandre. Both families said they credit the B.C. RCMP with bringing Mr. Andretti to justice.\nThe Crown attorney who prosecuted two Manitoba serial-killer cases \u2013 those of Mr. Andretti and Mr. Lamb, who pleaded guilty to two counts of manslaughter \u2013 said police need to devote significant resources to missing-person files because killers \u201ctrade\u201d on the reality that priorities will inevitably shift as cases grow colder. \u201cJust because we don\u2019t have a body does not mean that there hasn\u2019t been a [homicide],\u201d Sheilla Leinburd said. \u201cSuccess breeds arrogance in many ways. If they\u2019ve gotten away with it once or twice, they\u2019ll do it a third and fourth time.\u201d\nIn some of the cases featured in The Taken multimedia project, the victims\u2019 loved ones told The Globe that police were initially dismissive of their concerns and did not appear to take the missing-person report seriously. In the case of Ms. McPherson, the RCMP\u2019s missing-person bulletin misstated her ethnicity as Caucasian; the family made the painful decision not to correct the record for fear that the truth would lead to public apathy \u2013 or, worse yet, a biased police response, said the woman\u2019s sister, Kim McPherson.\nRCMP Superintendent Ward Lymburner, who oversees the E-PANA task force, noted that in response to the Oppal inquiry, the B.C. government recently rolled out provincial policing standards. The section on missing-person investigations says that when officers are determining the appropriate response, they must take into consideration the reality that indigenous women are more likely than non-indigenous women to be killed or go missing. It says risk may \u201cflow from the profile of the missing person, in particular their inclusion in groups that are at an increased risk of harm, such as Aboriginal women and girls.\u201d\nAccording to a 2013 best practices manual created by the RCMP\u2019s National Centre for Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains, police forces should treat each missing-person report as legitimate, serious and urgent at the outset, stating \u201cpoor outcomes can often be traced back to not taking a report seriously at the start, and making a risk judgment too early.\u201d The manual, which The Globe obtained through an access-to-information request, says agencies \u201cshould not treat certain types of missing persons differently at the very beginning (e.g. repeat runaway, persons of particular lifestyles, youth home elopee).\u201d The manual was provided to police agencies and is not binding.\nLast year, the RCMP sent a revamped national missing-persons policy to their commanding officers. It introduced two standardized documents: a 13-question risk assessment and a 10-page missing-person intake report to help ensure certain information is obtained at the outset of an investigation. The risk assessment asks \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d questions about the person\u2019s life and potential vulnerabilities, but it does not specifically ask if the missing individual is indigenous. When it comes to homicides, the RCMP have updated their paperwork to require that investigators indicate if a victim is aboriginal \u2013 a move lauded by the federal Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics.\nMs. Lavell-Harvard, the head of NWAC, said The Globe\u2019s investigation into serial killing speaks to the need for a national inquiry, adding the conversation is too often framed through the lens of on-reserve violence perpetrated by indigenous men. \u201cIf you\u2019re aware that a particular group is being targeted because of vulnerabilities,\u201d she said, \u201cthen you have to do that much more to protect that vulnerable group.\u201d\nWith reports from Rick Cash and Renata D\u2019Aliesio in Toronto and Kat Sieniuc in Vancouver\nDo you have information that could assist in our investigation into serial killing as it relates to the broader issue of Canada\u2019s missing and murdered women?

Canadian warplanes are still bombing Islamic State targets despite Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s campaign pledge to end these airstrikes in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\n\n\nThe airstrike in question, on November 19, one month after Mr. Trudeau won power, was intended to destroy what the Canadian military said was an Islamic State bomb-making factory in Mosul.\nBut local Iraq media reports, which included video and photographic evidence of collateral damage, say the attack on the bomb plant ended up damaging a dairy factory next door, killing between five and 13 people and injuring more than a dozen.\nAirwars.org, a project aimed at tracking the international air strikes against Islamic State militants, has collected local media reports on the alleged civilian deaths from outlets such as Nineveh Reporters Network, Mosul News, and Nineveh News.\nAccording to the local Nineveh Reporters\u2019 Network, the attack \u201ckilled all elements of the organization [Islamic State] who were inside the booby-trapping plant, but also damaged a large dairy building next door, killing approximately five civilian workers and injuring 13 others.\u201d\nCF-18s have launched at least 16 strikes since the Oct. 19 election and 193 in the region since last fall.\nMr. Trudeau has not set a firm date for withdrawing Canada\u2019s fighters.

It has not investigated the January 2015 incident because it says there was insufficient evidence.\nThe Canadian Armed Forces has refused to discuss the details of January\u2019s alleged civilian casualties and plays down the matter, saying that \u201cthe source of this allegation had himself heard of these potential casualties through a second-hand account\u201d and that nobody could corroborate it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22 hours ago \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tFIFA ethics judge opens cases against Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini\t\t\t\n\n\n\nZURICH (THE CANADIAN PRESS) \n\nFIFA ethics judge Joachim Eckert has formally opened cases against Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini and hopes to give verdicts in December.\n\n\n\n\nA spokesman Eckert for says Blatter and Platini \u201cwill be invited to submit positions including any evidence\u201d and can request hearings.\nThe FIFA and UEFA presidents, currently suspended for 90 days, face bans of at least several years for alleged financial wrongdoing.\nThe investigations chamber of the FIFA ethics committee said Saturday it submitted final case reports and asked for sanctions against both officials.

Blatter was suspended on Oct. 8 by the FIFA ethics committee.\nIn excerpts released Monday from a television interview, Blatter, without specifying his illness, said he was near death when hospitalized for stress-related problems this month.\nBlatter insisted to RTS in his first television interview since leaving the hospital on Nov. 12 that Platini, his former protege, is \u201can honest man\u201d who should be cleared of wrongdoing.\n\u201cIf he comes back, he will be elected,\u201d Blatter said. \u201cAnd then if he comes back, I\u2019m coming back also.\u201d\nThe suspended FIFA president was \u201cbetween the angels singing and the devil\u2019s fire.\n\u201cBut it was the angels which sang,\u201d Blatter said, adding \u201chappily I never lost consciousness\u201d during the 48 hours when most ill.\nParts of the interview were released ahead Wednesday\u2019s full broadcast.\nThe French-language broadcaster said in a news report late Sunday that the 79-year-old Blatter was treated in intensive care for several days.\nBlatter acknowledged he had been under \u201cenormous pressure,\u201d with personal legal problems arising from the $2 million payment and feels regret at not deciding to step down after a successful 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\nTwo days before the May 2015 election in Zurich, American and Swiss federal prosecutors revealed their investigations of bribery and corruption implicating FIFA and senior officials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under: NewsSports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22 hours ago \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tTrudeau to meet with British PM Cameron in London on first full bilateral visit\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBy Campbell Clark \u2014 Ottawa \n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau will meet British Prime Minister David Cameron in his first full bilateral visit to the head of a foreign government \u2013 and he can expect a welcome for his new climate-change policies.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Mr. Trudeau has already begun a whirlwind of travel to international summits, the first head-to-head visit is usually considered symbolic, and Canadian prime ministers often like to make it a sojourn to the White House.\nBut Mr. Trudeau will make Britain his first stop for a leader-to-leader visit when he meets Mr. Cameron in London on Wednesday \u2013 the same day he will have an audience with the Queen.\n\u201cThis is the first bilateral visit for Mr. Trudeau as Prime Minister, and it\u2019s to the U.K. And that\u2019s unusual \u2013 it\u2019s usually down south,\u201d British High Commissioner Howard Drake said. \u201cI think it testifies to how much the two countries matter to each other.\u201d\n (more\u2026)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under: News\n\n\nView all posts from News \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPolitics Live is part of The Globe and Mail's Globe Politics Network\n\t\t\t\u00a9 Copyright 2014 The Globe and Mail Inc.

Why do we need to spend more money to not solve anything. Actually most of the murders were solved and it turns out they were killed by other aboriginals, so why do they claim racism? You have no clue why they are gone for the unsolved and the solved ones it isn't racism? I'm getting tired of hearing from aboriginals. When you stop calling yourselves natives and start calling yourselves canadians like the rest of us maybe i won't feel like i'm second class and start listening\n\n\n\n8 \u00a0\n\n1\nReport as Offensive\n\n\n\n\n\nBy DAVID |\nFEBRUARY 15, 2016 12:48 PM\n\n\nThe end result will be another waste of taxpayer dollars revisiting the same results that have been reported and left lying on a shelf in a government basement gathering dust. The real issue is why are FN ignoring the root causes of why their youth are leaving the reserves in the first place. Instead of blaming the ROC they should be meeting with other FN communities asking the question that really matters. It's far easier to let someone else deal with your problems than actually come to the adult realization that YOU are part of the problem. \n\n\n\n122 \u00a0\n\n51\nReport as Offensive\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Michael |\nFEBRUARY 15, 2016 11:11 AM\n\n\n\"An example for why there should be no inquiry into missing, murdered aboriginal women\" Christie Blatchford (National Post: 2015.10.15)\nThis report tells us of a plague of lawyers and other government consultants living the good $$$ life at taxpayers' expense. \n\"Governments and public institutions can act on [the recommendations], or not, and mostly, they don\u2019t.

Walk for Olive Hill, an 85-year-old Penticton woman who was smothered to death and raped. Walk for Roxanne Louie, a 26-year-old mother of a three-year-old boy who was murdered in Penticton in 2015. Walk for the hundreds of missing and murdered aboriginal women.\u201d\n(Read more: Louie's story similar to similar to others across Canada)\nOn that night there will be a dinner starting at 5:30 p.m. followed by the keynote speakers at 6:30 p.m. then Herman Edwards will perform on the flute and the Tuesday Night Drum Circle will play the Women\u2019s Warrior song.\nThe night will conclude with a march to the Okanagan River Channel and a candlelight vigil. Transportation will be provided for those who require it.\n\u201cAboriginal women are at higher rates of poverty, have fewer resources and support, and often live in isolating situations,\u201d said Leslie Fabriz, Community Outreach Services from the Okanagan Nation Transition Emergency House (ONTEH) in the release. \u201cThe Sister in Spirit Vigil is a movement for social change and a reminder that our sisters and loved ones will not be forgotten.\u201d\nPolice statistics show the rate of victimization among aboriginal females is close to three times higher than non-aboriginal females.\nFrom 1980 to 2012 police-reported incidents of missing and murdered aboriginal females were 1,017.\nThe Indian Band Community is located at 841 Westhills Dr. and everyone is welcome.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage an open exchange of ideas on this story's topic, but we ask you to follow our guidelines for respecting community standards.

Indigenous people from across Canada cheered as the leader of the inquiry announced the report\u2019s findings at an ceremony in Gatineau, Quebec, that was attended by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Most in the audience were in traditional indigenous dress and held red flowers in remembrance of the women. Some in the crowd were relatives of the disappeared and dead, and were so overcome by emotion that they had to be led away in tears by health care workers. \n\n\n\n\n Despite Trudeau\u2019s assurances in his remarks that his government would take action on the report\u2019s 231 recommendations \u2014 including changes to police practices and the criminal justice system \u2014 some indigenous people expressed skepticism that the report would make a difference.  \u201cOur people have been in a violent relationship with Canada for too long,\u201d said Beverley Jacobs, a prominent Mohawk lawyer and the former president of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada.   The report comes after a nearly three-year inquiry into murdered and missing indigenous women and girls, during which more than 1,500 families of victims and survivors testified at hearings.  \u201cThis is genocide,\u201d said Marion Buller, the chief commissioner of the inquiry and a retired indigenous judge, at the ceremony, which was held at the Canadian Museum of History directly across the Ottawa River from Parliament.  After receiving the multivolume report, wrapped in a ceremonial blanket tied with a traditional M\u00e9tis sash, Trudeau said, \u201cThis is an uncomfortable day for Canada, but it is an essential day.\u201d  He added, \u201cTo the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls of Canada, to their families and to survivors \u2014 we have failed you.\u201d  Trudeau promised to \u201cconduct a thorough review of this report,\u201d including a \u201cNational Action Plan\u201d to address the violence, \u201cwith indigenous partners to determine next steps.\u201d  The report said the violence against women and girls amounted \u201cto a race-based genocide of Indigenous peoples, including First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis.\u201d  \u201cThis genocide has been empowered by colonial structures,\u201d the report added.  It cited, among other events, Canada\u2019s onetime practice of forcibly sending thousands of indigenous children to government-sponsored residential schools, where they were abused over decades. In 2015, Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission called that practice a \u201ccultural genocide.\u201d  Police \u201capathy often takes the form of stereotyping and victim-blaming, such as when police describe missing loved ones as \u2018drunks,\u2019 \u2018runaways out partying\u2019 or \u2018prostitutes unworthy of follow-up,\u2019\u201d the report said.  To help improve law enforcement and prevent violence against women, the report called for expanding indigenous women\u2019s shelters and improving policing in indigenous communities, in particular in remote areas; increasing the number of indigenous people on police forces; and empowering more indigenous women to serve on civilian boards that oversee police.  It also called for changing the criminal code to classify some killings of indigenous women by spouses with a history of violent abuse as first-degree murder, whether they were premeditated or not.  The report offered a damning indictment not just of the killers but of a country that has too often allowed them to act with impunity.  Indigenous women and girls make up about 4% of Canada\u2019s females but 16% of the females killed, according to government statistics. \n23357421\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView next article in Nation & World \n\n\n\n\nGet top headlines daily\n\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Ian Austen and Dan BilefskyNew York Times News Service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from Nation\n\n\n\n\n\n Around the world \n\n\n\n\n\n Officials mull demolishing Columbine High \n\n\n\n\n\n Mexico, U.S. make progress over tariffs \n\n\n\n\n\n Trump honors D-Day sacrifices in France \n\n\n\n\n\nToday in history, and birthdays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are effective HIV treatments.

They were routinely physically and sexually abused, both by the teachers who ran the schools and by older students who had typically been assaulted themselves. In some extreme instances, students were subjected to medical experimentation and sterilization by teachers and school administrators.\nThe last residential school didn\u2019t close until 1996. The Canadian government issued its first formal apology in 2008.\nStill, the lasting impact on Canada's indigenous populations is immeasurable. At least 4,000 children died while in the system \u2014 so many that it became common for residential schools to have their own cemeteries.\nThose who did survive, deprived of their families and their own cultural identities, became part of a series of lost generations. Languages died out; sacred ceremonies were suppressed and even criminalized. First Nations elders have called the residential school system\u2019s practices a cultural genocide.\nIn the fall of 2014, I spent a month documenting the school system\u2019s terrible legacy through photography. Much of this project focuses on the literal impact of what it means to lose one\u2019s identity. A disproportionate number of residential school survivors and their immediate families struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and substance abuse. First Nations peoples are also excessively marginalized in the public health system, and at least 1,200 aboriginal women have been reported missing or murdered over the past 30 years, further highlighting the well-being gap between indigenous and non-indigenous people.\nThe social injustices that continue to affect Canada\u2019s native populations need to be recorded and shared in order to prompt change.\nBut one of the many problems with images depicting drug use, alcoholism and poverty is that they can do more to shame and stigmatize the subjects than shed light on the sources of their suffering. In an attempt to overcome that challenge, I created multiple-exposure portraits to look at the causes, rather than the effects.\nI paired individuals with sites where residential schools once stood, government documents that enforced strategic assimilation and places where First Nations peoples now struggle to persevere. Each double exposure contains an echo of trauma, which lingers even during the healing process, as languages and traditions return.\nMost importantly, these images are meant to not only reveal the past, but also to look to the future \u2014 one in which Canada's indigenous peoples can hopefully find peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProject\n\n\n\n\n  \n Signs of Your Identity: HIV in Canada's First Nations \n While the global fight against HIV shows many signs of progress, there are still entire populations without sufficient access to necessary medical care.

(b) review its legislation at the federal, provincial and territorial levels, and coordinate police responses across the country, with a view to preventing the occurrence of such murders and disappearances; (c) investigate, prosecute, and punish the perpetrators and provide reparation to victims; and (d) address the root causes of violence against indigenous women and girls,\u201d stated the report.\n \nMore Syrian refugees to Canada\nBut Mulcair and his rivals also face pressure of a different kind: that of four million Syrian war refugees, many of whom are streaming into Europe in their thousands, while some have Canada in mind as a safe haven.\nMulcair said Canadians need a \"Prime minister who understands the urgency to act as crises unfold\" and said Canada under the NDP would welcome 46,000 Syrian refugees over the next four years, thereby fulfilling its United Nations obligations.\nSo far, less than 2,400 Syrians have been admitted into Canada since civil war first broke out in 2011.\nGermany by contrast is expecting to take in 800,000 refugees by the end of this year and many have already made the hazardous journey through Turkey, the Balkans, and central Europe to reach sanctuary, braving rough seas, hostile border guards, and hunger to escape their war-torn country. \n \nTalk of a greener future\u2026but no promises just two months before Paris talks\n\n\n\n\nOn climate change, Mulcair did not list specific actions, but said he would improve Canada's policies on climate change, which many argue have stalled since Stephen Harper took office.\n\"I believe in taking action on climate change today, so we don't leave an environmental debt to our children,\" said Mulcair.\nMulcair once again avoided committing to any concrete greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, just two months before the Conference of Parties (COP) 21 talks in Paris are due to begin.\nSpeaking at the Aug. 6 Leaders\u2019 Debate in Toronto, Mulcair vowed to play a constructive role in Paris if elected prime minister, but did not mention any emissions target.\nBut the NDP has promised to shift federal subsidies from oil sands industries to renewable energy and clean technology development, as well as taxing polluters for the environmental damage they cause.\nMulcair has also promised proper consultation and study before approving any major energy project such as Kinder Morgan\u2019s proposed Trans Mountain expansion between Edmonton and Burnaby.\nA leg-up for the poor and seniors\nReturning to more \u2018bread and butter\u2019 domestic issues, Mulcair restated his party\u2019s promise to roll out a $15 minimum wage to help lift working families out of poverty, alongside new taxes for the wealthy.\n\u201cI stand for a $15 minimum wage,\u201d said Mulcair, adding that people working full-time hours should not have to live in poverty.\nMulcair also promised that if an NDP government were elected, he would close a tax loophole loophole so that the wealthy would contribute tax dollars toward programs for feeding hungry children.\n\"Just a few months ago at the Broadbent Institute I got a chance to talk about tax loopholes, and the rich. Right now, there are a select few who benefit from a tax loophole for stock options. At the same time, in our country, hundreds of thousands of children will go to school without having eaten.\"\nThe NDP leader then attacked Harper for cutting federal health transfers, also taking a swipe at his Liberal predecessors for slashing billion in such transfers during the 1990s.\nMulcair also made his pitch to seniors and those Canadians struggling to access affordable medicines and mental health care.\n\"We're going to be focusing on four key elements - improving care for seniors, improving access to care at home, a comprehensive national strategy on mental health, and reducing the cost of medication,\u201d said Mulcair to cheers. \u201cWe will relieve pressure on overcrowded hospitals so they can provide emergency care to those who need it most.\u201d\nWith files from Jenny Uechi\n\n\n\n\nShare this article.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterFacebook Like\n\n\n\nSeptember 13th 2015Fram Dinshaw\n\n\n\nPolitics, Canada's 2015 Federal Election Campaign, Thomas Mulcair, missing and murdered aboriginal women, Syrian refugee crisis, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, News\n\n\n\n\nToday's must read \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the National Observer.

The national inquiry on murdered and missing Indigenous women comes to Edmonton today, a week after issuing an interim report calling for a national police task force to open old investigations. The inquiry will sit for three days in the Alberta capital to hear from family members about their missing daughters, wives and mothers. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl DyckEDMONTON  \u2013  The brother of a murdered Indigenous woman says Alberta RCMP destroyed his sister\u2019s belongings even though nobody had been charged in her death.\nPaul Tuccaro, whose sister Amber disappeared in 2010, told the inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women that police could at least have given them to her family instead of throwing them out.\nIn two hours of emotional testimony in Edmonton, he described how RCMP seemed to downplay the family\u2019s concerns about Amber\u2019s disappearance and didn\u2019t keep them in touch with the investigation after her body was found.\nThat investigation took a chilling turn when police released a recording of a cellphone conversation between Amber Tuccaro and a man with whom she was getting a ride.\nHer body was found a few days later.\nHer killer remains at large.\nThe national inquiry is scheduled to sit for three days in the Alberta capital to hear from family members about their missing daughters, wives and mothers.\nLast week, the inquiry called for some sort of investigative body to reopen existing cold cases. The commissioners are allowed to refer cases to police only when new information surfaces.\nChief commissioner Marion Buller says that doesn\u2019t address questions from family members who want to know why investigations were halted or why leads weren\u2019t followed up.\nThe commission\u2019s report also calls for Health Canada to expand an existing support program for those who testify.\nThe commission has been criticized by families and survivors disappointed in what they see as a lack of concrete action.\nThe Liberal government has earmarked $53.8 million and two years for the inquiry\u2019s work. One year is left.\n0000000000\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n\n Twitter\n Facebook\n Instagram\n YouTube\n Tumblr\n\n\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nArchive\n \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nThe Medicine Hat News\nOther Publications\n Contact\nCareers\n \n\n\nContact the Medicine Hat News\n\n3257 Dunmore Rd SE\n\t\t\t\t\tMedicine Hat, AB T1B 3R2\n[P] 403.527.1101\n[F] 403.528.5696\n\n\nContact\nCareers\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrint Advertising: 403.528.5659\n\t\t\t\t\tNational Advertising: 403.528.5766\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Advertising: 403.528.5698\n\t\t\t\t\tClassifieds: 403.526.7653\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2017 The Medicine Hat News, A Division of Continental Newspapers Canada Ltd.\nAdvertising\nTerms and Conditions & Privacy policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Most in the audience were in traditional indigenous dress and held red flowers in remembrance of the women.Some in the crowd were relatives of the disappeared and dead, and were so overcome by emotion that they had to be led away in tears by health care workers.But despite Trudeau\u2019s assurances in his remarks that his government would take action on the report\u2019s 231 recommendations \u2014 including changes to police practices and the criminal justice system \u2014 some indigenous people expressed skepticism that the report would make much of a difference.\u201cOur people have been in a violent relationship with Canada for too long,\u201d said Beverley Jacobs, a prominent Mohawk lawyer and the former president of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re in an abusive relationship and waiting for the abuser to change, but they\u2019re not willing to change, you have to figure out how to get out of the relationship.\u201dThe report comes after a nearly three-year inquiry into murdered and missing indigenous women and girls, during which more than 1,500 families of victims and survivors testified at hearings across the country.\u201cThis is genocide,\u201d said Marion Buller, the chief commissioner of the inquiry and a retired indigenous judge, at the ceremony, which was held at the Canadian Museum of History directly across the Ottawa River from Parliament.\u201cAn absolute paradigm shift is required to dismantle colonialism in Canadian society,\u201d she added.After receiving the multivolume report, wrapped in a ceremonial blanket tied with a traditional M\u00e9tis sash, Trudeau said, \u201cThis is an uncomfortable day for Canada but it is an essential day.\u201dHe added, \u201cTo the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls of Canada, to their families and to survivors \u2014 we have failed you.\u201dTrudeau promised to \u201cconduct a thorough review of this report,\u201d including a \u201cNational Action Plan\u201d to address the violence, \u201cwith indigenous partners to determine next steps.\u201dThe report said the violence against women and girls amounted \u201cto a race-based genocide of Indigenous peoples, including First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis.\u201d\u201cThis genocide has been empowered by colonial structures,\u201d the report added.It cited, among other events, Canada\u2019s onetime practice of forcibly sending thousands of indigenous children to government-sponsored residential schools, where they were abused over decades. In 2015, Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission called that practice a \u201ccultural genocide.\u201dThe report said police and the criminal justice system have historically failed indigenous women by ignoring their concerns and viewing them \u201cthrough a lens of pervasive racist and sexist stereotypes.\u201dThat, in turn, has created mistrust of authorities among indigenous women and girls, the report said.Police \u201capathy often takes the form of stereotyping and victim-blaming, such as when police describe missing loved ones as \u2018drunks,\u2019 \u2018runaways out partying\u2019 or \u2018prostitutes unworthy of follow-up,\u2019\u201d the report said.Survivors and their families told the inquiry they often found the \u201ccourt process inadequate, unjust and retraumatizing.\u201dTo help improve law enforcement and prevent violence against women, the report called for expanding indigenous women\u2019s shelters and improving policing in indigenous communities, in particular in remote areas; increasing the number of indigenous people on police forces; and empowering more indigenous women to serve on civilian boards that oversee police.It also called for changing the criminal code to classify some killings of indigenous women by spouses with a history of violent abuse as first-degree murder, whether they were premeditated or not.Saying that cultural discrimination has marginalized indigenous people, it also called for the federal and provincial governments to give indigenous languages the same status as Canada\u2019s official languages, English and French.The report offered a damning indictment not just of the killers but of a country that has too often allowed them to act with impunity.\u201cYes, genocide is exactly what\u2019s happening, and Canada is still in denial about this,\u201d said Lorelei Williams, a leading indigenous advocate in Vancouver whose aunt went missing four decades ago and whose cousin was murdered by the serial killer Robert Pickton.Indigenous women and girls make up about 4% of Canada\u2019s females but 16% of the females killed, according to government statistics.Some 1,181 indigenous women were killed or disappeared across the country from 1980 to 2012, according to a 2014 report by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Indigenous advocates, and the report, say the number is probably far higher since so many deaths have gone unreported.The commission\u2019s use of the word genocide has attracted some criticism, particularly in Quebec, as an excessive and improper use of the term.But Buller repeatedly stood by the inquiry\u2019s finding.\u201cThe type of genocide we have in Canada is death by a million paper cuts for generations,\u201d she told journalists.Paul Tuccaro, a member of the Mikisew Cree First Nation in northern Alberta, said he agreed with the inquiry\u2019s description.Tuccaro\u2019s younger sister, Amber, 20, disappeared in August 2010, he said. The mother of a 14-month-old son, she vanished after hitching a ride. Her remains were found in a farmer\u2019s field, and a killer has never been found.\u201cWhoever is doing what they\u2019re doing, they think they can kill all these women, and nothing will come of it because they\u2019re just \u2018Indians,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIDEO NEWS HIGHLIGHTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                MOST POPULAR\n                \n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n Articles\n\n\n Images\n\n\n Videos\n\n\n\n\nArticlesCherokee actor will receive an honorary Academy AwardPlaintiff: Martinez kept state police chief because of phone callCouncilor: HR bottleneck is hindering city servicesBrutal New Mexico deputy is no peace officerNorth Guadalupe Starbucks closes after one yearBuilding trust after trauma in Santa FeState engineer warns dams at risk due to wetter weatherAt LANL, political pawn or security risk?Give snakes some space in Santa Fe this summerAgua Fr\u00eda community farm schedules grand reopening\n\nImages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideosSorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                COLUMNISTS & BLOGS\n                \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Ringside Seat\n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n\n        Weed at forefront of grassroots presidential campaign\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Ringside Seat\n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n\n        Dems hope Watergate figure can tar Trump\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Will Webber\n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n\n        Mathis\u2019 departure is rough, but not calamitous\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Notes from the North\n        \n\n\n        \n        \n        \n\n        Highlands takes third national rugby crown\n        \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                Sections\n                \n            \n\n\n\n Santa Fe New Mexican homepage\n\n\nNews\n\n\nSports\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\nPasatiempo\n\n\nMagazines\n\n\nLife\n\n\nMultimedia\n\n\nCommenting FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                Services\n                \n            \n\n\n\nPlace Classified Ad\n\n\nSubscription Services\n\n\nSubmission Forms\n\n\nFeatured Ads\n\n\nFeatured Ads Reprints\n\n\nOpen House Listings\n\n\nOpen House Re-Prints\n\n\nCommercial Printing\n\n\nAd Rates\n\n\nWork at The New Mexican\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n                Contact Information\n                \n            \n\n\nsantafenewmexican.com\n    202 E.

Photo of Baron courtesy Brent Meeko Griffin          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSiasi Tullaugak died sometime before dawn on Aug. 29. By the time the sun rose, her body was hanging from a porch in downtown Montreal, half a block from Saint Catherine Street. Her feet dangled only a foot or two above the sidewalk.\n\n\n\n\nThe porch had the wrought-iron railings that are typical of Montreal. It was raised, like a low balcony, leaving enough space underneath to accommodate the entrance to a basement apartment. Curved steps led up one side, and on the opposite side, the top railing was screwed to a homemade wooden planter full of flowers.\nTullaugak\u2019s body hung from the side of the porch that held the planter, the police reportedly told the homeowners. That was part of why it didn\u2019t make sense when police deemed her death to be a suicide.\nIf she had walked up the steps, attached a noose to the railing and then climbed over it, she would have crushed the flowers. But they were untouched.\nYet there was no way to get to the railing from below, either. Tullaugak was around five feet tall. At age 27, she was often mistaken for a high school student. Perhaps she'd climbed up on something, like a chair? If she had, there was no sign of it the following morning.\nTullaugak left no note, and her friends and family immediately insisted she hadn\u2019t been suicidal. Montreal police closed the case two days later. They told media that Tullaugak had hung herself from the balcony of her apartment.\nHowever, police knew that the owners of the house where the body was found are a middle-aged white couple. They had no connection to Tullaugak, who was homeless. After waking up that morning to find crime-scene tape around their porch, the couple spoke briefly to police.\nTwo weeks later, the husband of the couple was still mulling over what had happened. \u201cI think about all of this. You know?\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s not possible for a girl to hang herself here.\u201d\nHis wife was more emphatic. \u201cNo no,\u201d she said. \u201cNo way. It\u2019s physically impossible.\u201d\nFor police to call the death a suicide, she said, \u201cmeans that they really didn\u2019t even try to understand what happened that night. That's the worst thing. She didn't die here. She was dead when she arrived here. Somebody hanged her here.\u201d\nPolice reopened Tullaugak\u2019s case within days, saying they were examining new information. Since then, the force has declined to provide details of the case or their work so far, saying they couldn\u2019t discuss an open investigation.\n'Very small, very innocent-looking'\nFamily remember Siasi \u2014 the name is the Inuktitut version of 'Jessie' \u2014 as a \u201chyperactive\u201d child, a girl who was constantly talking and cracking jokes. She was inseparable from her older sister.\nShe was from the town of Puvirnituq, Nunavik \u2014 the Inuit homeland of northernmost Quebec. That had much to do with how she died, according to those who knew her in her last months. But they say people outside those few blocks around Chomedey Street would find it hard to understand exactly why.\nFor decades, Inuit have been coming to Montreal from Nunavik. Sometimes they come for an education, sometimes they come for health care. They may return home unscathed. But sometimes they merely come for a visit \u2014 and end up staying for years, even decades, living in conditions they seem unable to escape.\nWhen Montrealers first began to see Inuit panhandling on city streets in the 1980s, journalists and researchers explored their plight. Many Inuit in that generation had lived through ordeals common to other Indigenous people, including being sent away for school.\nLess attention has been paid to a more recent generation of arrivals \u2014 young Inuit like Tullaugak, in their teens and twenties, who often end up in dire circumstances within just a few months of arriving in the city.\nSiasi Tullaugak's death in August 2017 in Montreal was initially deemed a suicide, but police are now investigating the matter further. Photo from FacebookThis younger cohort also faces serious social problems at home. But there is another distinct, disturbing pattern in their fates. The details of Siasi Tullaugak\u2019s life in Montreal echoed that of other young Inuit women, from the people with whom they had fateful encounters, to the marks on their bodies, to the way they died.\nIn fact, just two days after Tullaugak\u2019s death in August, the body of another local 27-year-old Inuk woman was found, also hanging.\nThe circumstances of Sharon Baron\u2019s death, in her apartment in the suburb of Dorval, point more clearly to suicide. The two women barely knew each other, and the timing of their deaths seems to be a coincidence. Still, there is a vital link between their cases.\nTullaugak wasn\u2019t new to Montreal in 2017. She had lived in the city a few years earlier, for almost a year. At that time, she and a boyfriend had an apartment in the Plateau neighbourhood, according to Sean French, a friend of Tullaugak's who lives near Montreal. But when Tullaugak came back in 2017, things went differently \u2014 and downhill \u2014 with a speed that stunned those around her.\nThe first time Cahill Rooney saw Tullaugak, last winter, he wondered why a shy, healthy-looking teenager, as he took her to be, was living on the street. She was \u201cvery, very small, very, very innocent-looking,\u201d says Rooney, a high-school principal who lives on Chomedey Street. Over time, Tullaugak would often chat with Rooney and ask for a loonie or a cigarette.\n\u201cI'd usually say, \u2018Where have you been, how's your day been?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cShe'd say, \u2018Okay, not too bad,\u2019\u201d though she often said she was hungry.\nIt\u2019s unclear why Tullaugak came back to Montreal in 2017. (Her family did not respond to a request for an interview.) At home in Puvirnituq she had racked up minor charges.\nBut everyone who knew her agrees that her first move upon arriving this year was to seek out the sister with whom she had been so close as a child. By some accounts, she was trying to fetch her sister and bring her home. Either way, she headed for a certain downtown corner.\nThe intersection of Atwater and Saint Catherine streets has a mall on one corner, and opposite it, a park called Cabot Square. Every night, people sit in groups in the park, often speaking Inuktitut.\nInuit have been gathering at the park since the 1980s. At any given time, some of the park\u2019s denizens are living on the street. Others are just visiting: When people from Nunavik fly south for medical treatment, or to accompany someone else receiving treatment, they have typically stayed at the YMCA across the street (a new residence in a suburb recently opened).\nThe way for Tullaugak to meet her sister was to go to Cabot Square. And talking to her sister this year usually meant also talking to a man who hovers by her shoulder, like a shadow.\nSiasi Tullaugak was often seen at Cabot Square in Montreal, pictured here on March 31, 2006, with a man known for targeting young Inuit women. Photo courtesy of Sachamd on Flickr Creative CommonsTullaugak met this man very shortly after she arrived. The first time Rooney saw her with him, his heart sank.\n\u201cSeeing she was hanging out with [that man]\u2026 I felt that her chance of being raped was almost a sure thing,\u201d he says.\nHowever, Tullaugak continued to seem fairly healthy \u2014 always cleanly dressed and seemingly sober when he spoke to her, Rooney says. What struck him was how single-mindedly she began to seek money. Within a few months, if she saw men approach during a conversation with Rooney, she would peel off and solicit them. As the summer wore on, she seemed to get more anxious, once asking Rooney, 75, if he\u2019d pay for sex.\nIn late August, she vanished for about a week, and then appeared one day in front of Rooney's patio.\n\u201cI just said, \u2018Oh hi, how are you, how have you been?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cAnd she instantly answered, 'Well, I'm still alive.'\" A few days later, she was dead.\nA trademark burn from a crack pipe\nSome of the details of Sharon Baron\u2019s life illustrate the world Tullaugak walked into.\nIn 2013, Baron was about 22 years old. She had been living in Dorval for five years. Then came the night that changed her life.\nSharon Baron smiles for a photo in Nunavik, Que. near Kuujuaq. Photo courtesy of Brent Meeko GriffinBaron \u201cwas a calm person, very shy and reserved,\u201d says Brent Meeko Griffin, her boyfriend at the time. Meeko Griffin, an Inuk former pilot for Air Inuit, had met Baron in Nunavik when she was 17, and she agreed to come live with him in Montreal.\nLife was good, for a while. The couple explored the city by bike, and went to parks and movies. Baron started planning to go back to school for her high school equivalency.\nMeeko Griffin recalls that when he proposed spending summer at his family's camp in Kuujjuarapik, Baron jumped at the idea, telling him she had loved camp life as a child.\nBut camp is not always what it used to be. One summer about five years ago, a polar bear mauled Baron's mother at the family camp near Kangiqsualujjuaq \u2014 an unusual attack by an animal made more unpredictable by climate change.\nBaron's mother was flown to Montreal for treatment, and, fatefully, was housed across from Cabot Square.\nBaron visited her mother regularly. She was waiting for the night bus to Dorval around 1 a.m. one night, at the corner of Atwater and Saint Catherine, when a man walked up and started chatting with her. He then offered her crack, says Meeko Griffin.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely someone I didn\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I did get the feeling it was someone she didn't know either.\u201d\nThough Baron wasn\u2019t in the habit of doing drugs, let alone such a hard drug, Meeko Griffin says he\u2019s not surprised that she and other young Inuit women would try it. \u201cUp north\u2026 we shake hands with strangers, everyone that's new in town,\u201d he says. \u201cThat led her to be curious, to be approachable.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re young and they wanted to experience the city and they\u2019re not so afraid to try something new. And in this case Sharon tried crack.\u201d\nBaron didn't come home that night. After searching the area for days, Meeko Griffin found her near Cabot Square. He never found out exactly where she was for the week she'd been away. She came home, but she wasn\u2019t same, he says \u2014 she constantly returned downtown, she was loud and argumentative, she lost a huge amount of weight and amassed bruises all over her body.\nFrom her evasive answers to his questions, he realized she was doing sex work.\nPhoto of Sharon Baron from Facebook\u201cShe was the complete opposite of herself,\u201d he says. Within six months, she moved out and began living on the street.\nOnce, Meeko Griffin invited her over, along with the man she called her new boyfriend, who was not Inuk. They said they had met when he supplied Baron with drugs. Another person Baron later said she \u201chustled with\u201d was the man who met the Tullaugak sisters.\nThat man is a fixture around Cabot Square. \u201cHe\u2019s been in this area for 20 years and he\u2019s been doing the same thing for 20 years \u2014 basically corralling young Inuit to do whatever it is they do to help them get high,\u201d says John Tessier, an outreach worker at the Open Door shelter.\nFor the man to profit from them, however, the women must first become addicted. An employee of a bar on Saint Catherine has seen the man repeatedly approaching young Inuit women during the first few nights of their visits to Montreal.\n\u201cHe starts to talk to them in the street, then finally he goes with them to the bar and buys them a beer,\u201d says the bar employee, whose interview was translated from French, and who didn\u2019t want to be identified for fear of losing his job. \u201cOften people want weed or things like that, and he offers it. And it starts like that.\u201d\nUsually the man picks young, small women who already do mild drugs, and he offers more, eventually asking to be paid back, say several people who have watched him operate for years. As the women earn money through sex, they turn it over to him and he buys crack for the group, himself included.\nWithin two or three months, the women typically have started to visibly change. The relationship with the pimp changes too, says the bar employee. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him hit women,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen one Inuk became disrespectful\u2026 he got a little crazy.\u201d\nOne Inuk woman who used to be under the pimp's control agreed to talk about the experience via Facebook messages, saying she no longer lives in Montreal and is no longer afraid of him.\nIn her account, the man gave crack to the Inuit girls he met, waited until they were high and then raped them. The violence he meted out included slapping the women and burning them with a crack pipe.\n\u201cIt\u2019s to say that he was with this girl by burning,\u201d she explained.\nHis trademark burn was \u201ctwo lines from a crack pipe,\u201d often on a victim's arm, she said. She still has the scars of her own branding.\n\n\n\n\nShe cut off the online interview after recalling those two memories, saying she was unable to continue.\nThe man\u2019s court records include at least two charges for assault with a weapon and one for conspiracy to commit murder.\nConcerns about young Inuit women\u2019s safety have grown enough in recent years to prompt a group of Montreal agencies to assemble a \u201cwelcome kit\u201d that will be given to young people from Nunavik as soon as they step off their Air Inuit flights. The kit includes a warning about \u201cpeople who will try to traffic you,\u201d says David Chapman, director of the Open Door shelter.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a pretty young Inuit woman and you're walking around these parts, there are people coming for you, without question,\u201d he says.\nVideo of David Chapman from Open Door shelter explains risks faced by Inuit women in Montreal\nOpen Door Shelter director David Chapman says Inuit women face risks of trafficking and recruitment into sex work. Video by Clothilde Goujard\nIn the Cabot Square area, people describe two or three men who work like Tullaugak\u2019s pimp, singling out Inuit women. None of them are Inuk.\nMontreal police, while declining to speak about Baron's and Tullaugak\u2019s cases, say prosecuting those who exploit Inuit women can be difficult.\n\u201cA lot of the time [the victims] are not coming forward, they feel isolated, they're vulnerable,\u201d says Carlo DeAngelis, the forces\u2019s aboriginal liaison officer. \u201cThe key is prevention,\u201d he says, going on to point to a list of police efforts to work with community groups.\n\u201cIf we could prevent them from being in a vulnerable situation when they come into the city, that would solve the problem,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, arrests are being done, [but] unfortunately, eventually they come back on the street or other individuals replace them.\u201d\nIn the case of Sharon Baron, none of the people interviewed for this story could say exactly what she experienced during her four years downtown. But they all agreed that she never recovered. About a year ago, she returned to Dorval, making her home in a sunny one-bedroom apartment with a new boyfriend, Matthew Smith. She tried to get clean, but it was hard to stay away from Cabot Square.\nDuring periods at home, she seemed to be trying to come to terms with her past, says Smith. Baron told him about the sex work she did downtown. When she was drunk, she began repeatedly mentioning her older sister, who had died in a house fire along with her children one Christmas Eve when Baron was a teenager.\nThe night Baron died, she and Smith were high on crack and vodka. He passed out; she went to a bar around the corner to meet friends. Staff there say she seemed her usual self.\nThe next thing Smith remembers, is \u201cwaking up in a hospital bed, crying and screaming. I thought it was a dream and hoped it was a dream.\u201d Police told him that he had called 911 to report suicidal feelings. When they arrived, they found Baron hanging in their closet. She had left no note.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know she had wandered off into the closet,\u201d he says. \u201cI was totally and completely blacked out\u201d \u2014 a common experience, he says.\nSmith\u2019s cellphone indeed showed a 10-minute call to 911. \u201cThe cops won\u2019t tell me anything,\u201d he says. \u201cThe case was closed in the first 24 hours, done and dusted.\u201d\nA week later, police came back for a statement from Smith, interviewing him for two hours about the day Baron died, and threatening him with a lie-detector test. They examined his phone records and told him they were \u201cdoing it for the coroner,\u201d he says. Police didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on Baron\u2019s case.\nSmith says he has no doubt that Baron killed herself. \u201cI know she missed her sister,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s why she did what she did.\u201d\nRumours of a serial killer \nIf it didn't surprise some of those closest to her, Baron\u2019s death still came as a shock in Cabot Square. There had been no news stories about Tullaugak\u2019s death two days earlier, nor any police updates.\nIn the information vacuum, rumours flew \u2014 some of them clearly wrong. \u201cShe was probably shot to death last night on Chomedey,\u201d Open Door's Chapman told one man that morning, after someone whispered the news in his ear. \u201cI don't have any more details. I don't know.\u201d\nWhen it emerged that police were treating both deaths as suicides, the rumours turned into a narrative \u2014 a serial killer or drug boss was murdering Inuk women and disguising the deaths as suicide.\n\u201cAre they going to attack me?\u201d said an older woman at a candlelight vigil for the two women. \u201cI sleep outside \u2014 are they going to attack me like those two? It\u2019s so hard sometimes.\u201d\nThe known details of Tullaugak\u2019s last night suggest she was upset about something. She started the evening at Cabot Square, but around midnight she went into a bar on Saint Catherine Street, alone.\n\u201cShe was usually happy,\u201d says Annie Saviadjuk, another Inuk woman who was there. \u201cThat night she was angry, angry, angry. She wasn\u2019t herself at all.\u201d\nTullaugak often stopped by the bar to say hello, but never for more than a few minutes, says a bartender there. That night, Tullaugak stayed for two hours, crying occasionally. The bartender tried to cheer her up with a free beer, and asked what was wrong.\nTullaugak said she missed her cousin, who was due to have a baby. The bartender handed over her phone so Tullaugak could see photos of her family on Facebook.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really know her \u2014 I just know her from here,\u201d says the bartender. \u201cShe really wanted to show me how she was up north.\u201d\nIn one photo, Tullaugak was smiling and holding a rifle, ready to go hunting. Another showed Tullaugak as a baby, along with her sister and another child on a couch. When she saw this image, Tullaugak began crying again, says the bartender.\nAt one point in the evening, a man walked over \u2014 someone whom no one could identify, but whom Tullaugak seemed to know. They had an interaction and \u201cshe went stiff,\u201d says the bartender. Tullaugak appeared to leave with the man at about 2 a.m.\nThere are six surveillance cameras in the bar, the employee says. \u201cI\u2019m surprised nobody came here to ask for the security video.\u201d\nTullaugak spent the next couple of hours in the lobby of a known crackhouse on Du Fort Street before she was picked up by a man she knew, according to a friend in Montreal. The friend last saw Tullaugak around 2:30 a.m. and later stopped by Cabot Square, where she ran into a known john who regularly hires Inuit women. He had been providing Tullaugak with drugs and, often, a place to stay this summer, says the friend.\nAs the two chatted in Cabot Square that night, Tullaugak kept messaging the man, asking to be picked up. She didn\u2019t explain why it was urgent. The man finally agreed, says Tullaugak\u2019s friend, but he was annoyed.\n\u201cHe was mad at her because Siasi [didn\u2019t] give sex to him,\u201d she says. \u201cThat's what he kind of told me \u2013 \u2018You don't want sex? Why are you calling me?\u2019 \u201d \nAccording to a Montreal Police report on Tullaugak\u2019s death obtained by Vice News, the police received a call that night saying that a man was \u201ctrying to force [Tullaugak] into an alley,\u201d and that officers spoke with her sometime that night.\nHard to get a ticket home\nThree weeks after Tullaugak\u2019s death, her pimp was sitting by himself in a parking lot behind the house where her body was found. On his phone, he was blasting \u201cToo Many Years,\u201d a song by the rapper Kodak Black. When the song ended, he immediately hit replay.\n\u201cI wish that I could rewind,\u201d he said, quoting the song's refrain. \u201cPeople that you can\u2019t get back.\u201d\nTullaugak was \u201crambunctious, full of energy, spunky,\u201d he said, adding that he was in love with her. \u201cNeither [she nor Sharon] had any intention of dying anytime soon.\u201d\nHe said he was nearby on the night when Tullaugak was attacked in the alley. He heard a scream, and ran up just after police arrived.\n\u201cI think it was probably an accident and they had to dispose of her a certain way,\u201d he said of Tullaugak's death. \u201cI heard that her neck was broken.\u201d\nWhen asked why, if it was an accident, anybody would have staged such a public suicide, he answered without a pause: \u201cBecause she was Inuit. That\u2019s how society looks at Inuit. Like they\u2019re suicidal. Like they\u2019re garbage. The best way to dispose of an Inuit is to make it look like suicide.\u201d\nWhen asked if he could think of any similar cases, he said \u201cNunia.\u201d\nNunia Grey was found hanging on Nov. 3, 2011, in the bathroom of her apartment near Atwater Street. Locals say the building is a crackhouse. She was 33 and left no note. Tessier of the Open Door says Grey had been part of the same \u201cposse\u201d that Tullaugak later joined, with the same pimp.\nAccording to a coroner\u2019s report, Grey's body was in such an advanced state of putrefaction by the time police were called that no toxicological analysis could be done. The death was ruled a suicide.\nGrey\u2019s aunt, who lives in Kuujjuaq, Nunavik's largest village, says she always wondered about the circumstances around her niece\u2019s death, never able to accept that she would have killed herself.\n\u201cNone of our family have ever believed that,\u201d says the aunt, who did not want to be named.\nGrey was a high-school graduate \u2014 rare in Nunavik \u2014 who came to Montreal to accompany a relative during surgery, and stayed. Grey had lost custody of her young sons, but when her aunt last saw her, about six months before her death, \u201cshe looked really good\u201d and said she had stopped drinking, the aunt said.\nThousands of Indigenous women have gone missing or been murdered in Canada since about 1980 \u2014 as many as 4,000, according to the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada. But it\u2019s unknown how many other deaths of Indigenous women, on top of those thousands, were recorded as suicide or accidents after investigations that relatives consider perfunctory. Carolyn Bennett, Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs, said last year that this was one of the main themes she heard from families while preparing for the national inquiry on the matter.\nA vigil is held in Cabot Square, Montreal, for the deaths of Siasi Tullaugak and Sharon Baron on September 8, 2017. Screen shot from APTN videoThe job of investigating police is difficult in such cases, and they don\u2019t always go the extra distance required, according to Jessica Quijano of the Native Women's Shelter of Montreal. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot harder to [investigate] when you\u2019re with people who are living on the street, who might not always be sober when you want to question them,\u201d she says. On top of that, \u201cthere\u2019s perpetual stereotypes\u2026that they would either commit suicide or have an overdose.\u201d\nIf Tullaugak\u2019s apparent suicide was staged, \u201cI don\u2019t think it was anything like some serial killer with an elaborate plan,\u201d says Quijano. \u201cI think it\u2019s just really easy.\u201d\nSince Tullaugak and Baron died, a number of Inuit women in Montreal have flown back to Nunavik, or have been trying to.\nTullaugak herself had tried to do the same. About a month before she died, she and her sister asked staff at the Open Door for help getting to Puvirnituq. The shelter was trying to arrange it, says Tessier.\nIt can be harder than it would seem, he says. The tickets have to be sponsored by Nunavik authorities, which can be difficult to arrange. Often, the people who want to fly have lost their ID. That was one problem for the Tullaugak sisters.\nTessier cites a recent case where \u201cwe were trying to get a girl home who was being held hostage, almost.\u201d Of women in this situation, he adds: \u201cThey\u2019re being intimidated not to leave. Maybe the dealer will give them something for free\u2026then it\u2019s like \u2018Oh, I gave you that for free, you\u2019ve got to work. You\u2019ve got to work it off.'\u201d\nTullaugak and Baron barely knew each, only \u201cenough to say hello to,\u201d says Smith, Baron\u2019s boyfriend. He says Baron would have been surprised by all the attention after her death. But in these cases, timing was everything.\n\u201cIf they [died] a month apart, I doubt it would even be on the news, to be honest,\u201d he says.\nEditor's Note: This article was produced in collaboration with the Echo Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n      Investigative journalism has never been more important.

Although the commissioners held two soft launches in September 2016 and February 2017 promising to launch the hearings soon, the inquiry has not started, nor will they hear from the families until fall 2017.\nGiven that the commissioners were given exceptionally limited time to conduct the inquiry, the fact that they have already used up nine of the 26 months allocated to them is a major concern. At this point, the commissioners have very little to show for either the time used or the money spent to date -- more than 10 per cent of its $53 million budget.\nGiven the lack of communication from the commissioners to date, we are all left wondering what is going on.\nEqually concerning are reports that the federal government has been behind some of the delays by refusing to share its lists of potential witnesses with the commissioners or advance adequate funding to allow much-needed staffing to occur.\nThe long list of Indigenous families, leaders and advocates raising public concerns has been met with extended periods of silence. Recent cancellations of scheduled meetings of the inquiry have led to increased criticism by the same Indigenous families and advocates who originally pushed so hard for the inquiry. There are even calls for the inquiry to be \"reset\" both in terms of the panel of commissioners and the inquiry format itself.\nBut, as problematic as all this administrative mess is -- and it could very well unravel the inquiry -- it is relatively minor in comparison to the fact that the inquiry, legally speaking, is fatally flawed.\nEven if the federal government had ensured the inquiry started earlier in Trudeau's term, and even if the commissioners had been able to quickly launch hearings, neither of these conditions could save the inquiry from its flawed Terms of Reference.\nThe Terms of Reference lack the two areas of inquiry that were most important to Indigenous families, leaders and advocates:\n1. A review of all the known police case files of murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls and;\n2. A comprehensive review and investigation of police behaviour, specifically racism, abuse and sexualized violence of Indigenous women and girls by police forces.\nYet, these two things are specifically exempted or protected from review in the terms, forcing witnesses who want to give evidence about these issues, to go back to the very same police forces that committed the flawed investigations of their missing or murdered loved ones, or the same police forces that failed to act on abuses by their officers.\nThere is no way to save this inquiry from such fatal flaws. The provinces and territories all passed orders-in-council to allow the inquiry to proceed in their jurisdictions based on the terms as drafted -- in other words, based on these two exemptions. Yet this flies in the face of what Indigenous women, leaders and advocates have long requested and what the minister heard in the national engagement sessions leading up to the drafting of the terms.\nDespite the Human Rights Watch report about police officers sexually abusing Indigenous women and girls in British Columbia with impunity; or the police officers in Val D'or, most of whom will not face charges for allegations of ongoing sexualized abuse of Indigenous women and girls in Quebec; or the rampant sexualized violence and discrimination within the RCMP as evidenced by the class action by its female members -- none of this will be open for examination.\nAt best, the commissioners might be able to look at systemic discrimination within policing policy -- but nothing that gets to heart of why so many Indigenous women fear police, and why so many of their investigations, or lack thereof, have been challenged by the families. This poses a real risk that we will end up with an inquiry that is more damaging than helpful. We could end up with a report like that of commissioner Wally Oppal from the Pickton inquiry which hints at generalized police failures in investigations but doesn't shine a light on the darker side of policing.\nOne of the worst outcomes would be a report that presents a general historical overview of colonization, a recap of the well-known socioeconomic problems plaguing First Nations or one that represents the voices of so few Indigenous witnesses that it misses the root problems altogether.\nThe inquiry terms are already biased toward violence in general and best practices related to violence prevention and safety. This has already led many commentators to focus on domestic violence, which is part of the issue, but by no means the whole issue. Such an unstructured inquiry means we could end up with a report on the already well-documented research on domestic violence but have nothing about police violence for example.\nGiven that the terms also focus the inquiry on the \"vulnerabilities\" of Indigenous women and girls as opposed to failures of federal, provincial and municipal governments and service agencies to protect the human rights of Indigenous women and girls -- the inquiry risks missing the whole point. The fatal flaws of the Terms of Reference are reason enough for a reset of the inquiry.\nThere is no shame in learning from the lessons of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's reset and making sure that the thousands of murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls, their families and communities get the inquiry they asked for and the justice they deserve.\nThis article was originally published in Lawyer's Daily.\nPhoto: Adam Scotti/PMO\nLike this article? rabble is reader-supported journalism.

Those commissioners should be diverse, representing First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis and different regions in Canada, according to the summary.\nOther recommendations include that commissioners should be impartial, with experience in human rights law, policing and justice issues. The appointment process for these commissioners needs to be public and transparent, the summary said.\nThe pre-inquiry summary also says that female survivors of violence, and the families of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls should be a priority throughout the inquiry. Trans and two-spirit people, as well as Indigenous elders, should all be included and financial supports should be made available.\n\u201cYou know when there\u2019s families that suffered a loss and you deal with it, and then all of sudden you\u2019re asked to talk about it again or somebody asks you about it, it\u2019s like opening things up all over again, we will definitely need that support,\u201d said Sharon Johnson, a Thunder Bay resident whose sister was found dead in 1992\nMinister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Carolyn Bennett\n.\nThe summary\u00a0includes recommendations about the structure and scope of the inquiry, stating that the focus should be broad enough to \u201cresult in recommendations for concrete actions for policy, program and legislative changes that address the underlying causes of violence against Indigenous women and girls.\u201d\nIt also recommends the inquiry have the authority to recommend changes within federal, provincial and territorial governments.\nThe summary suggests that national Indigenous organizations like the Assembly of First Nations and the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada play a supporting role in the inquiry, offering help to\u00a0families of victims or the commissioners themselves.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all that they should be doing is a supportive role,\u201d said Maloney. \u201cSomebody has to monitor and witness and critique the inquiry as it\u2019s going along. And if we play too much of a role in it then we\u2019re not the ones that can stand back and do that. \u201d\nThe government first announced the inquiry in December 2015, shortly after launching a \u2018pre-inquiry phase.\u2019 During that phase,\u00a0Minister of Indigenous Affairs Carolyn Bennett, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould and Minister of Status of Women Patty Hajdu \u00a0travelled the country, holding consultation meetings with victim\u2019s families, survivors of violence, and advocates for Indigenous women, among others\nThe government wanted to hear people\u2019s thoughts on who should lead the inquiry, who should be allowed to give testimony, and how to best set up the inquiry so that there can be concrete actions when it finishes.\nIn all, the ministers met with over 2,000 people at 17 meetings across the country\n\n\n\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

across the country in rallies Monday condemning the treatment of Indigenous people in the justice system.The rally outside the Penticton courthouse called for justice for Saskatchewan teenager Colton Boushie and Winnipeg teenager Tina Fontaine, both of whom recently had their alleged killers acquitted by juries.\"My one question for the courts and the government is how many more of us are going to have to die? How many more of us are going to have to be murdered for us to do something? For something to happen?\" said Mykelty Lezard, a youth from the Osoyoos Indian Band.\n\n\n\n\"I am tired. I am tired because I wake up every day and struggle. I wake up every day and hear our sisters and brothers were murdered again. There is no justice.\"Penticton Indian Band Chief Chad Eneas was in attendance at the rally along with Okanagan Nation Alliance Grand Chief Stewart Philip and his wife, Joan.Eneas said rallies like Monday's illustrate a shift in society.\"The truth is coming out and you can see in the diversity of the people that are represented here that we're all feeling this,\" Eneas said.The rally had both Indigenous and non-Indigenous supporters come out sporting signs with the faces of the two young Indigenous people whose deaths have sparked the movementReconciliation \u201ccan't solely happen in isolation. Fundamentally, we have to do it together and until there's equalized funding for us to effectively govern, like one of the principals Canada committed to, there's always going to be inequity, and there will not be justice,\" Eneas said.To this day, he continued, the Canadian government's relationship with Indigenous people has been paternalistic.\"The only way that the true reconciliation can happen is if they get to the core of the issue. The core of the issue is the land. This country, B.C. in particular and more particular in the Okanagan, the land question has always been avoided,\" Eneas said. \"When the Europeans got here, our people didn't suffer, they didn't starve. They didn't live in poverty. Today it's a very different world because of who's managing the land and the resources.\"Laurie Wilson has first-hand experience in the relationship with Indigenous people and the justice system. She has a law degree from UBC and acted as family spokesperson during the trial of Grace Robotti, who was convicted for the murder of Osoyoos Indian Band member Roxanne Louie in 2015.\"It's really an amazing thing when people come out and they have like minds together. People coming together for the same reason and people who are seeing the same thing,\" Wilson said. \"It's really lonely for Indigenous people to go, 'Why doesn't anyone see what we're seeing? Why doesn't anybody see racism? Why doesn't see injustice. It's really comforting, especially at a time when you get so sad, that people are like minded.\"Similar rallies were held in cities across Canada earlier this month.\"I think this is the start of something that will ensure we won't be silent, we'll always be saying something, we'll always be visible and I think that's the only thing we can do at this level,\" Wilson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nPost a comment as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmoticons \n\n\n[smile]\n[beam]\n[wink]\n[sad]\n[cool]\n[innocent]\n[rolleyes]\n[whistling]\n[lol]\n[huh]\n[tongue]\n[love]\n[sleeping]\n[yawn]\n[unsure]\n[angry]\n[blink]\n[crying]\n[ohmy]\n[scared]\n[sleep]\n[sneaky]\n[tongue_smile]\n[thumbdown]\n[thumbup]\n[censored]\n[happybirthday]\n[ban]\n[spam]\n[offtopic]\n[batman]\n[ninja]\n[pirate]\n[alien]\n\n\n\nComment Text\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\nPost comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nReport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\nReport Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nWatch this discussion.\nStop watching this discussion.\n\n\n\n\nWatch this discussion\n\n\n\n\n                            Get an email notification whenever someone contributes to the discussion\n                        \n\n                            Notifications from this discussion will be disabled.\n                        \n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\n\nStart watching\nStop watching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (0) comments \n                            \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the discussion.\n\n\nLog In\n\n\n\nKeep it Clean.

Carolyn Bennett, Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs, speaks alongside Jane Philpott, Minister of Indigenous Services, left, and Maryam Monsef, Minister of Status of Women, during a press conference at the National Press Theatre in Ottawa on Tuesday, June 5, 2018. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick  VANCOUVER - A lawyer for the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls has announced he's resigned, and in a statement cites government interference among his reasons.\t\t\t Breen Ouellette, who worked as a commission counsel for the inquiry at its Vancouver offices, posted online that he resigned on June 21.\t\t\t Breen, who is Metis, says in the statement that he believes the federal government has \"undermined the independence and impartiality of the national inquiry\" and that he cannot remain part of a process that he says \"is speeding towards failure.\"\t\t\t He also asks the inquiry's commissioners to allow him to fully disclose the reasons behind his resignation, which he says he cannot do as a lawyer.\t\t\t The inquiry has been plagued by chronic delays, staff turnover and complaints from families about disorganization, poor communication and a lack of transparency.\t\t\t    The office of the minister of Crown Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs responded to Ouellette's allegations late Monday by saying that \"at no time has the federal government made any effort to restrict or otherwise limit the powers the national inquiry has to gather evidence.\"\t\t\t The office added in its email that the inquiry is encouraged to \"use all of the resources at their disposal to seek the answers families have been demanding for decades.\"\t\t\t Nadine Gros-Louis, a spokeswoman for the inquiry, earlier confirmed in an email that Ouellette has stepped down, noting that staffing changes do occur.\t\t\t \"As you can appreciate, and as with all organizations, staffing does not remain constant, especially in an environment dealing with difficult subject matter where many staff work extended hours,\" Gros-Louis wrote.\t\t\t Breen's statement doesn't mention long hours. As an example of government interference, though, he said the inquiry needs to be able to properly investigate allegations of \"illegal and improper\" foster-care apprehensions.\t\t\t \"The national inquiry could use its powers to force government departments to comply with investigations into these allegations. The perpetrators could be identified so that governments could stop the misuse of billions of Canadian tax dollars by a few heartless bureaucrats seeking to advance their careers,\" Breen wrote.\t\t\t \"However, interference by the federal government is undermining this important function of the national inquiry. Canadians deserve to know which provinces and territories perpetuate this unnecessary and harmful spending of billions of tax dollars on foster-care apprehensions.\"\t\t\t Last month, the government turned down a request by inquiry officials for a two-year extension in order to give commissioners until Dec. 31, 2020, to make recommendations and produce findings.\t\t\t Instead, the government agreed to only extend the inquiry's deadline by another six months. That gives commissioners until next April 30 to finish its hearings and submit a final report, instead of the initial deadline of Nov. 1 of this year.\t\t\t Reached late Monday, Breen said the refusal to grant the two-year-extension, along with the funding for it, shows the government isn't serious about the commissioners meeting the inquiry's mandate.\t\t\t \"They're trying to kill the national inquiry in a death by a thousand cuts, and they're trying to pin the failure on the commissioners,\" Breen said in a phone interview from Vancouver.\t\t\t Carolyn Bennett, minister of Crown-Indigenous relations, explained the decision to extend the mandate by just six months was made in part because provinces and territories were not unanimously supportive of extending the terms of reference for the inquiry into next year.\t\t\t Gros-Louis, meanwhile, said the inquiry remains independent and impartial.\t\t\t \"With diverse backgrounds, experience and expertise, we are united by a deep commitment to honour the missing and murdered, uncover the truth and build a better future for Indigenous women and girls,\" she wrote.\t\t\t \u2014 by Rob Drinkwater in Edmonton\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAdvertise With Us\n\n\n\n\nReport Error\nSubmit a Tip\nRefundRefund\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tYou can comment on most stories on The Brandon Sun website.

(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)\nCALGARY \u2013 Canada\u2019s minister of Indigenous Affairs says she understands some families of missing and murdered Aboriginal women are still frustrated about the pace of a national inquiry.\nBut Carolyn Bennett promises the government won\u2019t let them down.\n\u201cWe need to keep going \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the families are counting on us,\u201d the minister told reporters Friday as she attended the opening of the Calgary Stampede Indian Village.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re all impatient. A lot of these people have been fighting for a decade or more for there to be some understanding of the issues from the child welfare system, to racism and sexism and policing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 things that the families were telling everybody about and nothing happened.\nMORE:\u00c2\u00a0The MMIW inquiry comes out in the open\u00e2\u0080\u0094literally\n\u201cCanada\u2019s never done anything like this\u2026this is huge.\u201d\nThe inquiry chaired by Marion Buller, the first female First Nations judge in B.C., was launched last September and is expected to take two years and cost $53.8 million.\nIt will hold nine community hearings across Canada this fall, amid controversy over the resignation of its executive director and complaints from families about delays and poor communication.\nEarlier this week, Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak Grand Chief Sheila North Wilson called for Buller to step down and the inquiry to restart.\nShe said it\u2019s nothing personal against Buller, but she is not someone the families are putting a lot of hope and faith in. North Wilson said she would like to see a chief commissioner who is better known among grassroots organizations and families.\nBuller responded that she had no intention of resigning from the position, saying a national inquiry takes time.\nMORE:\u00c2\u00a0The missing Mounties of the MMIW hearings\n\u201cWe started on Sept. 1, four commissioners and myself and a piece of paper, our terms of reference. In eight months, we hired staff, we opened offices, we put life to our terms of reference and we held our first hearing,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn my view, that\u2019s lightning speed.\u201d\nBennett expects two expert roundtables \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one on Indigenous law and the other on human rights \u00e2\u0080\u0094 will help develop the inquiry framework moving forward.\nShe said the announcement about public meetings this fall and meetings with family members concerned about the delay should help alleviate some concerns.\nThe community hearings will begin Sept. 10 in Thunder Bay, Ont., before moving on to Smithers, B.C., Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Halifax, Edmonton, Yellowknife, Maliotenam, Que., and closing in early December in Rankin Inlet, Nunavut.\n\n\n\n\n Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Twitter            \n\n\n\n                Facebook            \n\n\n\n                Google+ Share            \n\n\n\n                LinkedIn            \n\n\n\n                Reddit            \n\n\n\n                Email            \n\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under:\n\n\nCarolyn Bennett\nMMIW\nMMIW inquiry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\nPrevious B.C. wildfires: a look at some of the big fires around the province\n\n\nNext The Hamburg G20: What could possibly go wrong?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a comment\nHide comments\n\n \n\n\n\n\n Cancel reply \nSign in to comment.You're logged in as  .

Jennifer Catcheway disappeared in 2008 and her family says they feel abandoned by police and other authorities as they continue to search for her.\u00a0\u00a0(Steve Lambert / THE CANADIAN PRESS)\u00a0\u00a0By Martha TroianSpecial to the StarFri., Nov. 10, 2017Public Safety Canada will review a recommendation from the national inquiry mandated to examine violence against Indigenous women and girls to create an independent civilian-led body that could reopen cases or review investigations.On Nov. 1, the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls released its highly anticipated 119-page interim report. One of the 10 recommendations asked the federal government to work with provinces and territories to create a national police task force that could assess, reopen cases or review investigations.The next day, Public Safety Canada said it would look at the inquiry\u2019s recommendations.In an earlier statement a Public Safety Canada spokesperson said that processes are already in place to deal with the cases of missing and murdered women and girls.Karine Martel said the MMIWG inquiry is mandated to refer families to provincial or territorial police authorities if and when a family might want information about an ongoing or past investigation, prosecution or inquest. Martel also noted that Justice Canada supplemented its victim fund to provide culturally responsive services to family members.Article Continued BelowWhen asked about creating a national cold case unit that could prioritize cases, Martel said that unsolved cases are not considered \u201ccold\u201d and that homicide and missing persons units work closely with one another to solve unsolved cases. The RCMP has established special units across the country to review these files.Public Safety Canada, a federal department that, according to its website, deals with issues including national security, border strategies and emergency management, oversees the RCMP. In a statement, the RCMP said while policing is within its purview, \u201cthe creation/implementation/funding of a multi-jurisdictional, multi-agency, pan-Canadian task force is not the RCMP\u2019s decision to make.\u201dBut many families and advocates of missing women have pleaded for years that a lack of trust and confidence in officials, such as police and coroner\u2019s or medical examiners, means an oversight civilian body is needed.\u201cThere are historical pieces that have created this mistrust or created the divide,\u201d said Jennifer Lord, director of Violence Prevention and Safety at the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, referring to the high incarceration rate of Indigenous people, racial profiling or simply being followed around in stores by security guards.Ideally, advocates and family members say, this civilian body would be independent of the police and could investigate or re-examine solved, unsolved, unresolved or missing persons cases for family members. It would be an investigative agency and an avenue for family members to take their loved one\u2019s case to, other than a police authority. \u201cThey all protect themselves,\u201d says Pamela Palmater, a Mi\u2019kmaw lawyer and associate professor in the Department of Politics and Public Administration at Ryerson University about Public Safety Canada\u2019s statement about not creating an independent civilian body for family members. \u201cPublic Safety protects police and national security agencies, and police unions protect the police officers. The last thing they want exposed is significant problems in police investigations and police conduct.\u201dIn May 2014, the RCMP reported 1,181 of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and 225 unsolved cases of missing or murdered Indigenous females. Advocates and family members say the number of the missing and murdered is as high as 4,000. Advocates point to Ontario\u2019s Special Investigations Unit (SUI) as one example of an oversight body. The SIU investigates serious injury, death or allegations of sexual assault involving a police officer and has the power to lay charges against officers.An independent civilian body for missing and murdered cases could have similar powers, advocates say, and it could also identify any faulty investigations by officials and hold them to account. In its interim report the inquiry recommended Indigenous people be part of any police oversight bodies.Wilfred Catcheway of Portage la Prairie is the father to Jennifer, 18, from Skownan First Nation, Man., who went missing in 2008. The family claims the police did not take their daughter\u2019s disappearance seriously.\u201cSomething has to be in place where the RCMP are doing their job, especially when a person goes missing, that is a crucial time,\u201d says Catcheway. \u201cThe way the system is in place now, it hasn\u2019t worked and that\u2019s why there\u2019s so many missing Aboriginal women.\u201d This past summer, the inquiry said they will look into police conduct, refer information about cases to police authorities for police to re-examine and set up a forensic team to review police files.

It laid out in detail over more than 1,200 pages how a mix of \"appalling apathy\" and \"colonialist structures\" has fueled a \"national tragedy\" centuries in the \u00admaking.\n\"This is not what Canada is supposed to be about,\" the commission wrote. \"It is not what it purports to stand for.\"\nThe commission itself has drawn criticism for staff turnover and an alleged lack of transparency. Critics say the process won't bring justice because the panel wasn't granted the authority to compel police to reopen cases.\nTrudeau, who promised a \"total renewal\" of Canada's relationship with its 1.6 million indigenous people, launched the $92 million inquiry shortly after assuming office in 2015.\n\n\"This is an uncomfortable day for Canada, but it is an essential day,\" he said Monday. He promised to review the report and to implement a plan. The report \"will not be placed on a shelf to collect dust,\" he promised.\nThe commission, headed by Marion Buller, British Columbia's first female indigenous judge, crisscrossed the country for more than two years to take testimony from roughly 2,400 witnesses, including survivors and family members of victims.\nThey described the \u00adbodies of sisters, mothers and daughters being dredged out of rivers or found along a desolate stretch of British Columbia highway where so many indigenous women and girls have disappeared or been killed that it's called the \"Highway of Tears.\"\nWitnesses told the commission that police were slow to launch missing-persons investigations and quick to label unexplained deaths as drownings, suicides or drug overdoses, even when evidence suggested foul play.\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police reported 1,181 cases of murdered or missing indigenous women and girls from 1980 to 2012. Indigenous women are six times as likely to be victims of homicide than non-indigenous women, the government agency Statistics Canada reported in 2017.\n\nBut those figures could be a gross undercount, according to the commission, which concluded that \"no one knows the exact number\" because thousands of deaths and disappearances \"have likely gone unrecorded.\"\nThe commission concluded that colonial violence, racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia against indigenous women and girls have become so woven into the fabric of their lives that many have become accustomed to it.\nContributing to the violence, the commission said, are historical trauma from government-directed family separation policies, residential schools and land dispossession; social and economic marginalization, and a lack of willingness among Canadian institutions to change.\nAn \"absolute paradigm shift\" is needed \"to dismantle colonialism within Canadian society,\" the commission said.\nAmong its 231 recommendations, the commission advised creating an independent task force to investigate unresolved cases, increasing punishments for violent offenses when the victims are indigenous women and granting indigenous languages the same official status as English and French.\n\n\"Today, we hold up a mirror to Canada,\" Buller said.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n More from Star Tribune\n\n\n\nLocal\n\n                                Biting 'buffalo gnats' drive Minnesotans indoors\n                            \n\n\n                  June 6\n            \n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n                                Minn. board fines Rep.

Chip in to keep stories like these coming.\n\nLast week, former Prime Minister Paul Martin, told the media that the failure to address the many overlapping crises faced by Indigenous peoples is not a problem with Canadians -- Canadians are not racist. The problem is with Indigenous peoples -- we are invisible. Martin further alleges that Canadians are \"a generous people\" that will \"rise to the occasion\" to support others in need -- if they are aware of the issue.\u00a0\nHad these statements been made by anyone else, I might have let this insanity slip by as a severe case of willful blindness. However, Mr. Martin is a former Prime Minister and he knows better. Not only do we have a very deep and long-standing race problem in some segments of Canadian society, this racism has also infected every level, branch and\u00a0institution of the municipal, provincial, territorial and federal governments.\nThis race problem is not new. It is in fact, one of the primary root causes of the challenges faced by Indigenous peoples today. Canadians are well aware of both the racism issue and the many overlapping crises in First Nations.\nRacism in Canada is Real\nThe racism experienced by Indigenous peoples in Canada is not just a matter of insult or offence. While there are no shortage of racist, hateful comments made about us as individuals, communities and Nations -- the racism we face is lethal. \n\n\n\nIt doesn't just hurt our feelings -- it leads to our premature deaths in a large variety of ways. Scalping bounties led to the deaths on thousands of Mi'kmaw people. There was a higher death rate for Indigenous kids in residential schools than for soldiers in the Second World War. Thousands of Indigenous peoples are murdered or are disappeared. We have higher rates of disease and injury. And deaths while in the custody of hospitals, foster parents and police show how prevalent racism against Indigenous peoples is in Canada.\u00a0\nThis isn't just my opinion. The Royal Commission on the Donald Marshall Prosecution in 1989 found that he was wrongfully prosecuted and failed by everyone in the justice system because he was Native. 1996 Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples spoke about racism against Indigenous women. The Aboriginal Justice Inquiry in Manitoba in 1999 admitted the justice system fails Indigenous peoples on a \"massive scale.\" The 2007 Ipperwash report confirmed that racism in the Ontario Provincial Police was widespread. And there have been many other reports which all speak to the deep-seated racism within Canada and its institutions.\nWe've known for a very long time that stories in the media about Indigenous peoples draw a high number of racist and hateful comments from all segments of society including teachers, professors, authors, professionals and politicians. In November of 2015, the General Manager and Editor in Chief of CBC News Canada issued a statement explaining why CBC will no longer allow comments on stories about Indigenous peoples. The reason for this is that Indigenous-related stories brought out \"higher-than-average\" comments which were not only hateful but also racist.\u00a0\nMaclean's magazine even went so far as to say that Canada's race problem is far worse than America's and part of what makes it so bad is that Canadians keep denying they are racist.\nIn case you require something a little more official, the Ontario Human Rights Commission confirms that Canada has \"a legacy of racism -- particularly towards Aboriginal persons.\"\u00a0\nThe fact that Canada is so systemically and overtly racist is one of the reasons why Canada has so many laws against racism and hate speech, including federal and provincial human rights acts, the Criminal Code and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and is a signatory to numerous international human rights instruments. There would be no need for these protections if there were no issues around racism in Canada.\n\u00a0\nInvisibility versus Racist Indifference\u00a0\nLet's just address this fiction before it becomes the new Liberal mantra. Neither Indigenous peoples, nor the many overlapping crises we face are invisible. While 50 per cent of Indigenous people live in remote reserves, about 50 per cent live in or near urban centres. One can't walk down the street in Winnipeg or Saskatoon without seeing Indigenous people. In terms of the challenges we face, First Nations like Attawapiskat have put our higher rates of suicide, poverty, homelessness in the forefront and is a prime example of Canada's racist and differential responses to First Nation crises versus Canadian crises (Walkerton, Halifax, Fort McMurray).\nIndigenous activists like Cindy Blackstock have ensured that Canadians are well aware of the over-representation of First Nations kids in foster care. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal concluded that the reason for the chronic underfunding and disproportionate number of kids in foster care was because they were Native. The problem of racism in Canada means that a tribunal actually had to direct Canada to stop its discriminatory treatment of Indigenous kids -- and we are all still waiting for Canada to abide by this decision.\nThe Native Women's Association of Canada led the way with public education and advocacy to focus the country's attention on the thousands of murdered and missing Indigenous women. Even Canada's own Attorney General and Office of the Correctional Investigator rang the alarm on Canada's discriminatory treatment of Indigenous peoples which led to under-funded education systems and prisons over-represented with Indigenous peoples. We are far from invisible, but don't take their words for it -- the numbers speak for themselves.\nIn 2010, a study by Environics showed that 60 per cent of Canadians are either somewhat or very familiar with Indigenous issues. This is nothing new. In fact, over the last two decades, at least half of Canadians were familiar with Indigenous issues. The majority of Canadians also believe that the challenges faced by Indigenous peoples are the result of the attitudes of non-Indigenous people and government policies. Since 1993, Canadians have ranked addressing the living conditions on reserve as one of the top priorities. There is absolutely no doubt that Canadians and their politicians know about the issues.\u00a0\nIdle No More, the largest social movement in Canada's history, brought the issues of social conditions and unresolved treaties and land claims to the front of the media, government and world's attention and held it there for nearly a year. But Indigenous peoples didn't just capture the media headlines in 2012. There have been regular flash points over the last few decades that garnered a great deal of media attention including Listuguj, Oka, Gustafsen Lake, Ipperwash, Burnt Church, Elsipogtog, Caledonia and others.\nThere are few in Canada who could claim that Indigenous peoples are invisible. They may not want to acknowledge the lethal results of this kind of racism, but they are aware it exists. After the Truth and Reconciliation Report, few can deny the racist underpinnings of Canada's genocidal policies against Indigenous peoples.\nSo, no, racism is not a figment of our imaginations. The many tombstones from Indigenous peoples killed at the hands of priests, doctors, foster parents, police and bureaucrats prove otherwise. And, no, Indigenous peoples are not invisible. There isn't a newspaper, news channel or magazine that hasn't had pictures of dirty water, run down homes, or deceased Indigenous women as their lead story at some point. And finally, no, most Canadians are not unaware of our dire circumstances. It's the racist segments of society that make a conscious choice to turn a blind eye to our suffering while running to the aid of their non-Indigenous neighbor.\nWith all due respect, former Prime Minister Paul Martin's statements are themselves inherently racist. To\u00a0deny the racist intentions held by the countless\u00a0individuals and institutions\u00a0who have stolen, sterilized, experimented on, scalped, beaten, raped, murdered, and dispossessed Indigenous peoples of their identities, cultures, children, lands, resources and independence is itself an act of racism.\nIt is far too convenient to be willfully blind or indifferent to the lethal impacts of racism on Indigenous peoples. Apologies are easy,\u00a0as\u00a0are empty diversity policies and promises for a new relationship. The hard work is in making amends for the damage done and which continues to be done to Indigenous peoples by people and governments that still have racist ideologies and intentions.\nCanada was built on the dispossession, oppression and genocide of Indigenous peoples. Addressing racism now means far more than apologies, photo-ops and fancy words -- it means the return of our lands and resources, the recognition of our jurisdiction, and the full implementation of our rights. This means land, wealth, and power changes hands -- it means an uncomfortable recognition that Canada benefits from our continued oppression. Justice will require some discomfort. If it isn't uncomfortable, it isn't justice.\nThis isn't a multicultural issue or one of diversity -- we are not asking for \"equality,\" we are demanding justice. If we are going to move forward, we can't hide behind the convenience of the status quo or the relief felt when a former Prime Ministers say there is no racism. We have to be brave enough to shine a light on the problem and work together to address is. Indigenous peoples have many allies in Canadian society -- not everyone is racist. Unfortunately, many still hold racist views which threaten our lives.\nI think we can all do better than pretend the problem of racism against Indigenous peoples doesn't exist.While the new theme may be reconciliation, reconciliation is not a process in an of itself -- it starts first with the truth. If Canada cannot admit it has a racism problem, then we can never take steps to address it. Let's start the process.\nLike this article? rabble is reader-supported journalism.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck\nVANCOUVER \u2013 The national missing and murdered indigenous women\u2019s inquiry has failed to adequately reach out to loved ones and survivors, says a coalition of advocacy groups and families less than two months before hearings are set to begin.\nThe Coalition on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in British Columbia is calling on the commission and federal, provincial and territorial governments to do a better job of communicating with distraught families.\n\u201cThis is the last chance that family members who want to be heard will be heard,\u201d said Michele Pineault, the mother of Stephanie Lane, whose DNA was found on serial killer Robert Pickton\u2019s farm. \u201cThis inquiry is very, very important to a lot of people.\u201d\nRELATED: \u201cIt could have been me.\u201d\nCoalition member Fay Blaney said at a news conference Monday that the group was concerned about media reports that said the inquiry had only located about 100 family members or survivors as of two weeks ago.\nAn RCMP report in 2014 said police had identified nearly 1,200 missing or murdered indigenous women and girls in Canada.\nBlaney said she understood the federal government had not shared with commissioners the names of those who came forward during pre-inquiry consultations due to privacy obligations.\nShe said the commission should immediately request that all levels of government and indigenous organizations reach out to family members and survivors to ensure they know how to register to be a witness.\nThe coalition is also concerned that federal, provincial and territorial governments appear not to be assisting the inquiry, Blaney added.\nChief commissioner Marion Buller said in a statement that the commission has now identified 195 family members and survivors.\nRELATED: Wake up. The threat to our Indigenous women is Canada\u2019s problem.\nBuller said it has been reaching out to families and communities through its website, social media, podcasts, newsletters, regular teleconferences with national indigenous organizations and advisory meetings.\nThe inquiry is holding a series of regional meetings across the country to receive input from survivors and families before the first public hearing on May 29 in Whitehorse.\nThe commission has said families and survivors who would like to share their stories do not need to apply for standing and should instead send an email or call a toll-free number. It has asked national indigenous organizations to share the contact information, said Buller.\nBut Lorelei Williams, whose aunt went missing decades ago and whose cousin\u2019s DNA was found on Pickton\u2019s farm, said the commission should be proactively reaching out.\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling so frustrated and very upset about what is going on with this inquiry so far,\u201d she said. \u201cFamilies are freaking out right now.\u201d\nWilliams questioned why pre-inquiry consultations were held at all, if not to collect names of family members for the inquiry.\n\u201cWhat did they do that for?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m going to assume that those families put their names forward for a reason. \u2026 They want to be a part of this.\u201d\nShawn Jackson, a spokesman for Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, said it transferred to the national inquiry in November a database of information collected during the pre-inquiry process including meeting recordings and correspondence.\nOPINION: Canada\u2019s race problem? It\u2019s even worse than America\u2019s.\nHowever, Jackson said many people participated in the consultations anonymously and Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada is prevented by privacy rules from providing the lists of participants.\nThe coalition is also urging the inquiry to make efforts to include \u201cfamilies of the heart,\u201d or friends. Evelyn Youngchief\u2019s friend Georgina Papin was killed by Pickton and she said many friends of the missing and murdered would like to speak.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for a very long time,\u201d she said. \u201cChanges need to be made on how aboriginal women are looked at. Stop killing us.\u201d\nPineault said it has been difficult to tell her story over and over again for the past 20 years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s at a point now where I just want to say, \u2018I want a life of normalcy. I just want to stay home and not have anything to do with this.\u2019 But I have to do it to the bitter end.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Twitter            \n\n\n\n                Facebook            \n\n\n\n                Google+ Share            \n\n\n\n                LinkedIn            \n\n\n\n                Reddit            \n\n\n\n                Email            \n\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under:\n\n\nMissing and murdered indigenous women\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n      \u2002\u2002\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\nPrevious The Canada150 Quiz Countdown trivia test: Day 63!\n\n\nNext Margaret Atwood on the author Gabrielle Roy, in nine parts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a comment\nHide comments\n\n \n\n\n\n\n Cancel reply \nSign in to comment.You're logged in as  .

Jurors who sat through three weeks of evidence at Raymond Cormier\u2019s trial found him not guilty on Feb. 22 of second-degree murder. The Indigenous girl\u2019s body, wrapped in a duvet cover and weighed down by rocks, was pulled from the Red River eight days after she disappeared in August 2014. The verdict sparked rallies and protests across the country.\nHere is what the jury heard:\nTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TINA AND CORMIER\nCourt heard Tina had a happy childhood raised by a great-aunt on the Sagkeeng First Nation, but the girl began to spiral downward when her father was murdered in October 2011. Tina\u2019s mother, who had not been part of her life, re-emerged and Tina started going to Winnipeg to visit her. The girl ended up on the street and was being sexually exploited. Tina\u2019s boyfriend Cody Mason, who was 18 at the time, testified the pair first met Cormier earlier in the summer of 2014 and told him they didn\u2019t have a place to stay. Cormier, who court heard was a methamphetamine and crack user, took them to a house with a basement. Known to some as Sebastian and to others as Frenchy, Cormier supplied Tina with the prescription drug gabapentin, said Mason, who added he and Tina would also drink and take marijuana and cocaine. Tina told a social worker that Cormier was a much older man who was going to get her a bike. Cormier told friends he had had sex with the 15-year-old. One witness, Sarah Holland, testified she once saw Cormier grope Tina while asking her to \u201cjust do me.\u201d\n\u2014\nTHE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE\nThe cause of Tina\u2019s death was undetermined. Dr. Dennis Rhee testified that he found no definitive injuries on her body or to her internal organs. He said there was no evidence of a sexual assault, no signs of a stabbing or major blunt force trauma. It was estimated her body was in the river for three to seven days. There was no evidence that she drowned, but it couldn\u2019t be ruled out. Christopher Keddy, who works at the RCMP forensics lab, testified that tests showed Tina\u2019s body had a level of alcohol slightly above the legal limit for driving. Keddy also said there was a relatively high level of THC \u2013 the active ingredient in marijuana. There was no indication of gabapentin, but Keddy said the test the RCMP lab ran might not detect low levels of the drug. Under cross-examination, the defence suggested it couldn\u2019t be ruled out that gabapentin was in Tina\u2019s system at a potentially lethal level in combination with other drugs. There was no DNA evidence linking Cormier to Fontaine.\n\u2014\nTHE DUVET COVER\nThree people connected to Cormier told police he owned the same type of duvet cover that was wrapped around Tina\u2019s body. DNA testing found no traces linking Cormier to the cover. Court heard police tried to find the source of the duvet cover. It was sold by Costco Canada and 864 had been shipped to the three Costco stores in Winnipeg. Police tracked down 100 people who had purchased covers with the same design to ask them whether they still had them. Under cross-examination, investigators acknowledged Costco had given away some of the unsold duvet covers, and police could not rule out whether similar ones had been purchased elsewhere and brought to Winnipeg.\n\u2014\nTHE ARGUMENT ON THE STREET\nOn Aug. 6, about two weeks before Tina\u2019s body was found and three days before she was reported missing, witnesses saw her arguing with Cormier in the street and heard Cormier mention something about a river. Holland testified that she heard Tina tell Cormier she was going to call the cops. The Crown argued that Cormier was worried that Tina was going to report that he had stolen a truck. Court heard an audio recording of Tina calling 911 to report a stolen truck. Witnesses also testified that Tina was angry that Cormier had sold her bike for drugs. Cormier acknowledged the argument in an interview with police and said he followed her down the street before turning in the other direction. He said that was the last time he saw her. He also suggested the suspect police should look for was a man who looked like singer Robert Plant and who was walking in the same direction as Tina that night. \u201cDon\u2019t focus on me,\u201d he told police.\n\u2014\nERNIE DeWOLFE\nDeWolfe met Cormier in prison and they stayed at the same halfway house for a time. DeWolfe testified he talked to Cormier on Aug. 15 and Cormier said he had met with Tina the previous day to ensure she was not going to call the police. \u201cHe just said that he had talked to her and he straightened it all out and took care of it,\u201d DeWolfe testified. \u201cI just presumed that he talked to her and \u2026 sorted it out.\u201d Tina\u2019s body was found in the river on Aug. 17. In cross-examination, the defence suggested DeWolfe made the whole story up because he and Cormier had had an argument over money.\n\u2014\nTHE UNDERCOVER TAPES\nPolice launched a six-month undercover operation against Cormier called Project Styx. Cormier was placed in a bugged apartment for free and an undercover officer moved into a suite on the same floor. Cormier was recorded saying he\u2019d bet the girl was killed because he found out she was only 15 years old. \u201cI drew the line and that\u2019s why she got killed,\u201d he said. Cormier also told a woman that when he last talked to Tina, he told her to go jump off a bridge. At another point, he asked a woman if she had ever been \u201chaunted by something\u201d before he started to talk about Tina and boast that he beat two murders. During another recording, Cormier said during an argument with a woman that there was a little girl in a \u201cgrave someplace screaming at the top of her lungs for me to finish the job. And guess what? I finished the job.\u201d Court also heard Cormier in a recording warning people in his apartment not to overdose or they would end up wrapped in a carpet and thrown in the river. In conversations with the undercover officer, Cormier said there were \u201cthree rules to crime: deny, deny deny.\u201d\n\u2014\nTHE ARGUMENTS\nCrown prosecutors contended that Cormier killed Tina, either by suffocation or drowning, because he found out she was only 15 and that would make him a pedophile. They said Cormier\u2019s own words on the undercover tapes should be enough to convict him. The defence said that with no DNA evidence and no cause of death, there were too many holes in the case. It argued that Cormier felt guilt after learning that Tina was only 15 and he wanted to find the real killer.\n\u2014\nShare this story:\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n\n Twitter\n Facebook\n Instagram\n YouTube\n Tumblr\n\n\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nArchive\n \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nThe Medicine Hat News\nOther Publications\n Contact\nCareers\n \n\n\nContact the Medicine Hat News\n\n3257 Dunmore Rd SE\n\t\t\t\t\tMedicine Hat, AB T1B 3R2\n[P] 403.527.1101\n[F] 403.528.5696\n\n\nContact\nCareers\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrint Advertising: 403.528.5659\n\t\t\t\t\tNational Advertising: 403.528.5766\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Advertising: 403.528.5698\n\t\t\t\t\tClassifieds: 403.526.7653\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2018 The Medicine Hat News, A Division of Continental Newspapers Canada Ltd.\nAdvertising\nTerms and Conditions & Privacy policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Our 400 years of shared history has brought us a massive gap in the quality of life between indigenous peoples and the rest of Canada.\"\n Bellegarde had called on natives to come out for the first time en masse to vote in the last elections that swept Trudeau's Liberals into power.\n It was an effort to sway public policy after years of inaction on native issues, including gross poverty and desperation in many aboriginal communities that breeds abuse, suicide and crime.\n A record eight aboriginal Liberal MPs were elected in October, and two were named to Trudeau's cabinet, including Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.\n Native leaders and activists have been calling for an inquiry for more than a decade, since dozens of prostitutes went missing in Vancouver's seedy Downtown Eastside and were later determined to have been victims of a serial killer.\n A 2014 report and an update this year by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police identified 1,049 murdered and 172 missing aboriginal women dating back to 1980.\nIn most cases, the perpetrators were known to the victims.\n Wilson-Raybould said the inquiry will be held in the Spring following consultations with victims' families and native groups.\n \"No inquiry can undo what happened nor can it restore what we have lost,\" she said. \n But the violence against indigenous women -- who represent four per cent of the population and 16 percent of homicide victims -- \"is a national tragedy that requires an urgent and deliberate national response,\" she said.\n Wilson-Raybould noted the \"heartbreaking reality that girls born in our indigenous communities are three times more likely to experience violent crime\".\n Past studies have linked the violence to racism, sexism, colonialism, poverty, unemployment, lack of safe transportation, mental health and substance abuse, according to Status of Women Minister Patty Hajdu.\n Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett said the goal of the inquiry is to bring an end to the ongoing violence through \"concrete actions\".\n \"The victims deserve justice,\" said Trudeau, \"their families an opportunity to heal, and to be heard. We must work together to put an end to this on going tragedy.\"\n In addition to ordering the inquiry, Trudeau vowed to make \"significant investments\" in native education and to lift a cap on federal funding for indigenous communities.\n Furthermore, he said Canada would \"fully implement\" the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\n Canada and three other countries -- Australia, New Zealand and the United States -- were the only nations to vote against the UN indigenous text in 2007. \u2014 AFP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Comments:\n\n\nMore comment...\n\n\n\n\n                Send Us Your Comments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent comment ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                See also:\n\n\n                            Fans cram into Brazil football stadium to mourn dead players (December, 01 2016)\n\n                            'Catastrophic' water shortages for 500,000 in Mosul1 (December, 01 2016)\n\n                            Conservative Fillon wins French presidential primary (November, 28 2016)\n\n                            Hollande endures \u2019ghost\u2019 jibes as opposition holds fresh debate (November, 03 2016)\n\n                            EU suspends Colombia fund after shock vote (October, 06 2016)\n\n                            Done deal: Paris climate pact to enter into force (October, 06 2016)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Highlight\n\n\n                        Young HCM City writer aims to reach hearts\n\n\n\n                        A scoop of holy water\n\n\n\n                        Young mom's tours help children practise English\n\n\n\n                        Teaching our kids lessons in life, not test prep\n\n\n\n                        Heroes a plenty in Samara as England qualify for the World Cup semifinals for the first time in 28 years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Latest\nMost Read\n\n\n\n\n                            Young HCM City writer aims to reach hearts\n\n                            A scoop of holy water\n\n                            Young mom's tours help children practise English\n\n                            Teaching our kids lessons in life, not test prep\n\n                            The railway track people of the capital city\n\n                            Fine dining at \u0110\u00e0 L\u1ea1t\u2019s Wooden House\n\n\n\n\n\n                            Heavy rain forecast nationwide.\n\n                            Travellers say, \u2019Thank you, Vi\u1ec7t Nam!\u2019\n\n                            Vietnamese girl\u2019s murder gets life term\n\n                            VN should be resilient to shifting megatrends: WB\n\n                            Vi\u1ec7t Nam, France agree to cooperate in building smart cities\n\n                            More than 4,100 people die in traffic accidents so far this year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-paper\n\n\nE-paper \nSubscribe\nPrint Advertisement\n\nOnline Advertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Top\n\n\nPolitics & Laws\nSociety\nEconomy\nLife & Style\nSports\nEnvironment\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Explore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Society\nA Twist in the TaleTalk Around Town\n\n\n\n                                Economy\nBusiness BeatTalking Shop\n\n\n\n                                English Through the News\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Life & Style\nExpat Corner\n\n\n\n                                Sports\n\n\n\n                                Travel\n\n\n\n                                Sunday\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Politics & Laws\n\n\n\n                                Environment\n\n\n\n                                Opinion\nYou AskedOutlookYour SayOp-EdIn the Spotlight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Banking Property Markets Tech Wheels Biz Guide\nEvents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n|\nAbout us\n\n|\n\nContact us\n|\nRss\n\n\n            Copyrights 2012 Viet Nam News, All rights reserved .Add:79 Ly Thuong Kiet Street,\n            Ha Noi, Viet Nam.

Provincial Court Judge Marion Buller will investigate the root causes of violence against First Nations women, who are more likely to go missing or die by violence than members of the non-indigenous population.\n\n\tHolding an inquiry was a key pledge of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during last year's federal election campaign. While originally cheered by First Nations rights activists, the inquiry has come under fire over fears it will not adequately investigate police conduct.\n\n\tConnie Greyeyes, a Fort St. John campaigner for missing and murdered women, said she's hopeful the inquiry's findings will make indigenous women safer.\n\n\t\"On the one hand it's 'Oh my God, they're actually going to do this inquiry,'\" she said. \"And on the other hand, is it actually going to do anything?\"\n\nGreyeyes said she personally knows 14 women from the Peace Region who have gone missing or been murdered. For years, she has attended vigils with Sisters in Spirit in Ottawa to highlight the problem in Northeast B.C.\n\n\tThe Northeast B.C. delegation's presence at the vigils attracted the attention of Amnesty International, which is expected to release a report on resource extraction, the Site C dam and violence against women this week.\n\n\tAn RCMP report released in 2014 found 1,186 indigenous women had been murdered or gone missing across Canada in a 30-year span, including along the Highway of Tears in North Central B.C.\n\n\tStephen Harper's Conservative Government resisted holding an inquiry, maintaining that the issue had received enough study. At a debate in Fort St. John last fall, Conservative MP Bob Zimmer said at least 42 studies had been done on missing and murdered women.\n\n\t\"If I thought an inquiry would save one life \u2014 one life \u2014 I absolutely would do it,\" he said, adding \"one of the major drivers of missing and murdered aboriginal women is lack of economic activity or, simply put, a lack of a job.\" He said bringing economic activity to reserves was the best way to prevent women from falling into dangerous situations.\n\n\tOne of the chief criticisms of the current inquiry that commissioners cannot investigate police misconduct or compel law enforcement agencies to reopen cold cases. Since the terms of reference were released last week, the inquiry has also been criticized for not adequately consulting with families.\n\n\tGreyeyes said she agreed with some of the criticisms.\n\n\t\"I don't think that it's going to be completely for nothing,\" Greyeyes said. \"I've met Carolyn Bennett, she's a good person, she has a good heart, she's been to the rallies, I've seen her on the front lines. I do have faith her heart is in the right place.\"\n\n\t\"How are you going to delve into some of these cases that families want reopened?\" she said. \"Those are the kind of things family want answers for, and how much power are you giving these commissioners? Are you giving them enough power so they can really make a change for families? We don't know.\"\n\n\tThe commission is expected to complete the inquiry by the end of 2018.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/John Woods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMEMBERTOU, N.S. \u2014 A Mi'kmaq activist said she felt the presence of missing and murdered Indigenous women as families gathered in Nova Scotia for this week's community hearings, and their stories of loss deserve to be told.Cheryl Maloney said she sensed a \"healing energy\" in the air during Sunday's opening ceremonies ahead of the three-days of hearings by the inquiry looking into the deaths and disappearances of Indigenous women and girls.  The hearings are being held at Membertou First Nation in Cape Breton.\"The purpose of the ... ceremonies is to honour the women and the ancestors that are coming here for this truth,\" said Maloney. \"A lot of people are feeling the presence of the missing and murdered women.\"The president of the Nova Scotia Native Women's Association is among 40 witnesses who are expected to testify at the hearings, which kick off on Monday.Many of those gathering to testify participated in a community feast on Sunday evening that included drumming, dancing and singing.Catherine Martin, a Mi'kmaq filmmaker and storyteller, said during the ceremonies she's been inspired by the efforts by aboriginal women to bring the stories of missing and murdered aboriginal women and girls to light.\"The strength of these women has inspiring to me. ... It's a commitment to bring these women back to where they should be, a place of honour, a sacred place.\"Maloney said she and other community members are working to \"back up\" Indigenous women and families as they prepare to share their traumatic stories with the inquiry, which has been criticized for lacking such emotional supports.The inquiry has been dogged by controversy, including delays and a high-profile resignation, prompting some groups to call for a restart.Maloney echoed concerns that have been raised in recent months, but said the inquiry should nevertheless push ahead.\"We can't be very critical ... We have to do what we can to make things work,\" she said. \"It's not just the families. This is the stories of the life and death of missing and murdered Indigenous women that we're talking about.\"Maloney said she has lost sleep in anticipation of her testimony before the commissioners on Tuesday, where she will speak on behalf of the family of Victoria Rose Paul of Indian Brook, N.S.The 44-year-old woman died in 2009 after suffering a stroke while in jail for public intoxication.A review of the Truro, N.S., police\u2019s handling of the incident found that officers did not properly monitor Paul's health while she was in custody. It also said she was incoherent and left lying on the cement floor of the lockup for four hours in her own urine.The commission is also expected to hear from the family of murdered Innu student Loretta Saunders.The 26-year-old's body was found on the side of a New Brunswick highway in February 2014.Miriam Saunders said outside the conference area that she hoped to spread the message about the need for improved social services for indigenous women.\"The reason I chose Nova Scotia is that my daughter was murdered here and here is where I feel all my supports are,\" she said in an interview the night before the hearings began. \"I'd like to talk about the way my people are being treated. There are many ways they're being mistreated through different organizations including social services, child welfare. I can see why they're getting murdered because there's no supports in our community to help them be stronger people,\" she said.The inquiry has visited three communities across Canada prior to this week's hearings: Whitehorse, Smithers B.C., and Winnipeg.An interim report is set to be released on Nov. 1.\u2014 Story by Adina Bresge in Halifax, with files from Michael Tutton.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2017 Prince George Citizen\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail to a Friend\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Email Address: *\n\n\nYour Name: *\n\n\nTo Email Address: *\n\n\nMessage: *\n\n\n\n* Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\u2039\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nprevious\nCity taxpayers will bear the burden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext\nCariboo Cougars continue their winning ways\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprevious\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOT POLL\nThe B.C.

Hearings have since been held in B.C., Manitoba and Nova Scotia.The inquiry is probing the \u201csystemic forms and causes\u201d of violence against Indigenous women and girls, and has already conducted what Buller called \u201can historic\u201d review of previous studies in this area.Pressure was mounting on the previous Conservative government to start a public inquiry, after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police released a report in 2014 that said 1,017 Indigenous women were murdered between 1980 and 2012, and another 164 women were missing. An update to the report in 2015 said 174 Indigenous women were missing in Canada, and this represented 11 per cent of all missing women in the country.The Conservative government refused to start an inquiry. Then-prime minister Stephen Harper deemed the issue to be criminal, not \u201csociological.\u201d\u201cThis is not the time to commit sociology,\u201d he said at the time.The Liberals came to power promising to change course, and announced in December 2015, a month into their mandate, that there would be an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.The government named the inquiry commissioners the following summer, and the inquiry launched in September 2016, although public hearings to gather testimony from victims\u2019 loved ones didn\u2019t start for another eight months.According to the inquiry\u2019s website, the homicide rate for Indigenous women between 1997 and 2000 was almost seven times higher than it was for non-Indigenous women.Indigenous women experience violence, including domestic and sexual violence, at rates 3.5 times higher than non-Indigenous women do, according to the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada and the Canadian Feminist Alliance for International Action.Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines\u00a0NewsletterSubscribeThe Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E\u00a01E6.

To pay for the inquiry, Chiefs of Ontario\u00a0\u2014 a group representing 163 communities\u00a0\u2014 has launched a website\u00a0called Who Is She\u00a0where the public can make donations. The site\u00a0also\u00a0features\u00a0photographs of the missing and murdered, as well as messages from their families.\u00a0 \"Every indigenous woman and girl should feel safe in this country,\" said Denise Stonefish, deputy grand chief of the\u00a0Association of Iroquois and Allied Indians, which is aligned with Chiefs of Ontario. \"First Nations families cannot wait for Ottawa to stop indigenous women and girls from disappearing.\"\n\n\n\n Both the federal Liberals and New Democrats have vowed to launch a public inquiry if elected, something the Conservative government has refused to do. Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne applauded the Ontario Chiefs for starting the \"Who Is She\" campaign. \"I think that it is laudable that they are going to be doing a campaign here in Ontario,\" Wynne said. \"I will continue to raise my voice in the call for a national inquiry.\" The head of Chiefs of Ontario said their inquiry would not replace a national public inquiry commissioned by the federal government. \"Canada must be held accountable for its inaction on this issue,\" said Isadore Day, regional chief for Ontario. \"It's a wonderful time to get the message out there, don't you think,\" Day said of the federal election. \"If we were to wait until the election campaign was over we would be remiss \u2014 we would have missed a good opportunity.\" World attention The staggeringly high numbers of missing and murdered aboriginal women has drawn world attention. A 2015 United Nations report found that young aboriginal women are five times more likely to die under violent circumstances, as compared with their non-aboriginal counterparts. Last year, the RCMP released\u00a0a report that said there were 1,181 cases of missing and murdered aboriginal women between 1980 and 2012. Earlier this year, the force updated those numbers and said an additional\u00a032 aboriginal women have been slain and 11 more have disappeared since 2013. There is no dollar figure set for the fundraising campaign, and\u00a0Day acknowledged that public inquiries can be very expensive, but\u00a0said that wasn't the chiefs' main concern. \"The urgency of this matter is one that has prompted us to not\u00a0look at the total cost of an inquiry,\" he said. \"What we're\u00a0proposing here is we're going to do whatever we can, within our\u00a0might, with the goodwill of our partners, to establish the beginning\u00a0phases of that inquiry.\"Also on HuffPost:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\ue007\n\n\n\t\t\t\t   Canada's Missing Aboriginal Women\t\t\t\t  \n\n\n\n\nof\n\n\n\ue000\n\n\n\ue001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaisy Odjick was last seen on September 6, 2008 in Maniwaki, Quebec.

(WINNIPEG POLICE DEPARTMENT)\nThe defence has closed its case without presenting any evidence in the second-degree murder trial of Raymond Cormier, who is 55.\nCormier is accused of killing 15-year-old Tina Fontaine, whose\u00a02014 death sparked renewed calls for a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women.\nThe jury has heard that Tina was raised by her great-aunt on the Sagkeeng First Nation, but went to Winnipeg to visit her mother and became an exploited youth.\nCourt was told there were no witnesses to Tina\u2019s death and no DNA linking her to the accused, while experts testified they don\u2019t know how she died.\nThe jury is to hear closing arguments on Tuesday.\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jonathan HaywardWHITEHORSE  \u2013  A man who lost his mother, first to the so-called 60s Scoop then to murder, told the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls that the investigation will have to prove it\u2019s worthy of his trust.\nTerry Ladue\u2019s hands shook as he delivered blunt and powerful testimony to the commissioners on the final day of hearings in Whitehorse. He said his mother Jane Dick was beaten to death after he and his siblings were taken from her by child welfare agents in the 1960s and placed in non-indigenous homes.\n\u201cThe effect it had on me is very simple. I don\u2019t know how to love. I was never taught that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got three beautiful boys out there and I can\u2019t even tell them I love them because I don\u2019t know what the heck that word means.\n\u201cThe effect it had on me is it drove me down to Vancouver and stuck a needle up my arm for 13 years, trying to kill the pain.\u201d\nLadue said he doesn\u2019t trust the inquiry because all government has ever done is hurt him, take him away from his parents and throw his people in jail. He urged the commissioners to do more than just talk and to take action to elevate indigenous people in society.\nLadue said he has held the bitterness inside for decades.\n\u201cDealing with this today, for me, is letting go of something that I haven\u2019t let go of for 52 years, and that\u2019s the anger I have towards the government officials and the anger I have towards the RCMP.\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust. You want my trust, you\u2019ve got to earn my trust. If I see this fall apart, I\u2019ll never trust again.\u201d\nSeveral listeners, including commissioner Qajaq Robinson, were crying by the end of Ladue\u2019s testimony.\nThe first family hearings held by the national inquiry began on Tuesday and will wrap up Thursday with a closing ceremony. Chief Commissioner Marion Buller has said it is crucial to the inquiry that hearings be successful, and families are split on whether that was the case.\nShaun LaDue, who uses a capital D in his last name unlike his brother, said he felt respected and heard after testifying about their mother.\n\u201cThe hearings so far to me seem to be going very good. The commissioners are listening to us with their heart and their soul and they\u2019re very responsive to what the Yukon First Nations families have to say about the missing and murdered women,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\u201cI have good hope  \u2013  a big, strong hope  \u2013  that when they go across Canada, people will see that they\u2019re working their hardest.\u201d\nJoan Jack, a lawyer and family member of a murdered woman, criticized the quasi-judicial format of the inquiry. She said the formal processes of the inquiry, including the swearing-in of witnesses, is making many participants uncomfortable.\nShe also wanted to know why the inquiry\u2019s lead legal counsel is not indigenous.\nJack said all Canadians need to hear the uncomfortable truths revealed during testimony to the inquiry, saying that while the details are disturbing, the only way to make progress is if everyone suffers together.\nThe inquiry has faced criticism from families and advocates across the country about delays and poor communications. Other community hearings won\u2019t be held until the fall.\n(The Canadian Press, CKRW)\n000000000000\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n\n Facebook\n Twitter\n YouTube\n\n\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nSubscription Services\nArchive\n \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nThe Lethbridge Herald\nOther Publications\nFood For Thought\n Contact\nCareers\n \n\n\nContact the Lethbridge Herald\n\n504 - 7th Street South\n\t\t\t\t\tLethbridge, AB T1J 3Z7\n[P] (403) 328-4411\n[F] (403)328-4536\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrint Advertising: (403) 328-4410\n\t\t\t\t\tNational Advertising: (403) 380-7585\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Advertising: (403) 380-7585\n\t\t\t\t\tClassifieds: (403) 328-4433\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2017 The Lethbridge Herald, A Division of Continental Newspapers Canada Ltd.\nAdvertising\nTerms and Conditions & Privacy Policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

- Jurors in Winnipeg are to continue deliberating today at the trial of the man accused of killing 15-year-old Tina Fontaine and dumping her body in the Red River.Raymond Cormier, 56, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder in the August 2014 slaying of Fontaine, whose body was found wrapped in a duvet that was weighted down with rocks.Her death reignited calls for a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women.Manitoba Chief Justice Glenn Joyal spent three hours Wednesday instructing the seven woman, four man jury on the key issues in the case and how to come to a decision.He explained that there are only two questions that the jurors need answer.\"Unless you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt the Crown has proved that Tina Fontaine's death was caused by an unlawful act and that the accused Raymond Cormier committed the unlawful act you must find Raymond Cormier not guilty of second-degree murder. Your deliberations will be over,\" Joyal said.\"If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt Raymond Cormier committed the unlawful act that caused the death of Tina Fontaine you must find Raymond Cormier guilty of second-degree murder as charged.\"The jury has heard that Tina was raised by her great-aunt on the Sagkeeng First Nation, 120 kilometres north of Winnipeg, but went to the city to visit her mother. It was there that the girl became an exploited youth.Court was told there were no witnesses to Tina's death and no DNA linking her to the accused. Experts testified they don't know how she died.Crown prosecutors said the teen was killed and dumped in the river by Cormier, who had sex with her and found out she was a minor.\n\n\n\nJoyal urged the jurors to keep an open mind while discussing the case.\"The jury's decision is a group decision. Everyone has a say and an equal say. Your duty is to consult with each other. The verdict must be based on the facts as you find them,\" he said.\"For there to be a verdict in this case it is necessary for all 11 jurors to agree on a decision. In other words a verdict whether of not guilty or guilty expresses the unanimous opinion of the jury.\"Follow @BillGraveland on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nNational\n \nJustice\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nPost a comment as \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmoticons \n\n\n[smile]\n[beam]\n[wink]\n[sad]\n[cool]\n[innocent]\n[rolleyes]\n[whistling]\n[lol]\n[huh]\n[tongue]\n[love]\n[sleeping]\n[yawn]\n[unsure]\n[angry]\n[blink]\n[crying]\n[ohmy]\n[scared]\n[sleep]\n[sneaky]\n[tongue_smile]\n[thumbdown]\n[thumbup]\n[censored]\n[happybirthday]\n[ban]\n[spam]\n[offtopic]\n[batman]\n[ninja]\n[pirate]\n[alien]\n\n\n\nComment Text\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\nPost comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nReport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\nReport Abuse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\nWatch this discussion.\nStop watching this discussion.\n\n\n\n\nWatch this discussion\n\n\n\n\n                            Get an email notification whenever someone contributes to the discussion\n                        \n\n                            Notifications from this discussion will be disabled.\n                        \n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\n\nStart watching\nStop watching\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (0) comments \n                            \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the discussion.\n\n\nLog In\n\n\n\nKeep it Clean.

Pam Palmater, the chair in Indigenous Governance at Ryerson University, is seen in Dartmouth, N.S. in 2012. Palmater has signed an open letter calling for changes to the national inquiry into murdered and missing indigenous women.\u00a0\u00a0(Andrew Vaughan / THE CANADIAN PRESS)\u00a0\u00a0By Tanya TalagaStaff ReporterTues., May 16, 2017As the launch of the national inquiry into murdered and missing indigenous women and girls gets closer, its leadership is being criticized for being \u201cdisorganized, haphazard\u201d and failing to produce something as basic as a schedule of events and locations.An open letter to the inquiry\u2019s Chief Commissioner Marion Buller, signed by nearly 40 families, indigenous leaders and artists, was released on Monday in advance of the inquiry\u2019s formal start in Whitehorse on May 29. Also Monday, the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada (NWAC) released their latest report card on the inquiry\u2019s progress \u2014 giving failing grades nearly all around.\u201cIndigenous people, anybody, can be understanding as long as you communicate, as long as you know why it is happening and that is probably the biggest downfall of this inquiry \u2014 they don\u2019t seem to have a plan,\u201d said Francyne Joe, the interim president of NWAC whose report card gave the inquiry failing grades on 10 out of 15 action items. The other five had either not enough information to assign a grade or needed work.Read more: Speed up missing and murdered indigenous women inquiry: EditorialArticle Continued BelowManitoba families of missing, murdered indigenous women say hearings must go aheadMissing, murdered women\u2019s inquiry frustrating families, advocates sayOne failure is properly explaining to families that the onus is on them if they want to participate in the inquiry, which indigenous leaders and advocates fought years to get. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police say there are nearly 1,200 murdered and missing indigenous women and girls in Canada, spanning the last several decades, but many feel that number is larger.The nearly 300 families now participating in the inquiry process, up from 92 in March, \u201cdo not represent nearly enough families to host a series of national hearings,\u201d the NWAC report said. And it is unclear how the most marginalized groups \u2014 those who are homeless or in child welfare or incarcerated \u2014 will participate in the process.\u201cRight now they need to apologize to families, not just on their website or social media, but a proper letter to the families on how they will make amends and say this is our schedule,\u201d Joe said.Chief Commissioner Buller, a British Columbia judge, has repeatedly said the inquiry will start as planned and will prepare a final report by the end of December 2018. The inquiry was unable to provide immediate reaction to this story.Both the NWAC report card and the open letter to Buller insist the inquiry must reset now in order to save itself. \u201cWe request that you, as the leader of this inquiry, substantially rework your approach in order to regain trust and ensure that families are no longer feeling re-traumatized in the process,\u201d said the May 15, 2017 open letter to Buller, signed by lawyer Beverley Jacobs who is the former president of NWAC, M\u00e9tis artist Christi Belcourt, Maggie Cywink, Ontario\u2019s special advisor to the inquiry and sister of Sonya Cywink who was found murdered in 1994 and Pam Palmater, chair in Indigenous Governance at Ryerson University.The letter noted the timeframe for the inquiry is \u201cclearly too short\u201d as the first report is due on Nov. 1, 2017 and the hearings for most of the families will be happening in the fall. Expert testimony is expected to take up much of the summer. \u201cWe recommend that you formally request an extension now rather than wait,\u201d the letter stated.The letter writers want an answer from the commissioner by May 22 and if not, they said they will proceed to the next phase but declined to say what that will be.The families are being impacted by disorganization, an absence of information and they don\u2019t even know if they should have lawyers with them when they testify, said Jacobs, who has been raising awareness of MMIW for decades. \u201cNobody knows anything, that is the problem,\u201d said Jacobs, who added the respect and care of the families should be the top priority but the letter writers have heard from families that the process so far has left some families re-traumatized.  \u201cIt\u2019s horrible. I was really trying to stay positive or that something would change and they would start to build trust because if the families aren\u2019t feeling safe, even in this process, how will they manage?\u201d asked Jacobs, whose cousin Tashina General was murdered in 2008. The inquiry has to understand that they are in serious trouble and at this point, trying to tread water and do things with little tweaks here and there isn\u2019t going to do it, said Belcourt. A formal request needs to be made to the Prime Minister\u2019s office to adjust the terms of reference so the inquiry\u2019s $53.8 million budget can be put in the inquiry\u2019s control.Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines\u00a0NewsletterSubscribeThe Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E\u00a01E6.

She won\u2019t be there when her daughter needs her most, when she\u2019s in pain, or on her wedding day.\nThese are the losses Vicki Hill says she\u2019s suffered because of the death of her mother, whose naked body was found along British Columbia\u2019s Highway of Tears in 1978.\n\u201cI never knew her, but to me, in my eyes, she gave me life,\u201d\u00a0Hill told the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women on Tuesday. \u201cNow I have to live without her.\u201d\nHill was the first family member to testify at an inquiry hearing in Smithers, B.C., on Tuesday. She spoke softly and slowly, and her 15-year-old daughter, Zoey Hill-Harris, comforted her as tears rolled down her face.\nShe said she was only six months old when her mother died and has no memories of her. The murder was never solved and she has struggled to get information and documents from police, she said.\nHill read from a coroner\u2019s inquest report that concluded her 31-year-old mother died of bronchitis and pneumonia as a result of manslaughter. There was semen on her body and her clothes were discovered in an alley in Prince Rupert, 33 kilometres from where she was found dead, she said.\nDozens of women have died or gone missing along the stretch of Highway 16 between Prince Rupert and Prince George, which has become known as the Highway of Tears.\n\u201cI\u2019m not only speaking for my mom, I\u2019m speaking for the rest of the families. I feel their pain, I feel their hurt. I can see it.\nI\u2019m not afraid,\u201d she said. \u201cThings have got to change, no matter what.\u201d\nHill called on the commissioners to listen to families and bring them justice, adding she wants to see improved cellphone service and transportation along the Highway of Tears.\nThere is no cell service between Prince Rupert and Terrace, or in nearby Moricetown, she said, and she\u2019s never seen phone booths or emergency telephones, either.\nA British Columbia inquiry into missing and murdered women recommended bus service along the route, but it took years for the service to arrive, and some buses have to be caught in the middle of the night, she said.\nVivian Tom, chief of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en First Nation in Burns Lake, also spoke Tuesday. Her powerful testimony about her 21-year-old daughter Destiny Tom brought several observers to tears.\nTom recalled forgiving and hugging her daughter\u2019s common-law partner and killer, Garrett George, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to just over eight years in prison last November.\nShe also described a vision she had in church soon after her daughter\u2019s death. She saw her daughter\u2019s body, and she held her and rocked her in her arms, she said.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Destiny, I\u2019m so sorry! I\u2019m so sorry for what happened to you! I love you and I miss you. I\u2019m so sorry that you were all alone when this happened,\u2019 \u201d she said through sobs.\nTom said she then saw white wings sprout from her own shoulders and hands emerge from clouds above, then she flew with her daughter\u2019s body to place it gently in the hands.\nWhen she had her daughter\u2019s tombstone made, she made sure it had angel wings on it, she added.\nTom and her husband are raising their granddaughter, Cassidy, who is now seven. She was six when she talked about committing suicide, she said.\n\u201cIt just broke my heart,\u201d said Tom. \u201cShe figured that because the teenagers in our community attempted suicide \u2026 she figured, death, suicide, then she could be with her mom.\n\u201cI sat her on my lap, I said, \u2018Baby girl, if you commit suicide, you can\u2019t be with mom, because mommy fought hard for every breath.\u201d\u2019\nThe inquiry has been plagued by controversy, with commissioner Marilyn Poitras resigning this summer and complaints from families about delays and poor communication.\nChief Commissioner Marion Buller said during opening remarks Tuesday that she and fellow commissioner Michele Audette will listen to families and survivors with open minds and open hearts.\nSmithers is the first of nine communities the inquiry will visit this fall. The hearings runs through Thursday.\n\u00a0\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story? We'd like to hear from you about this or any other stories you think we should know about.

This is an issue of indigenous women\u2019s equality,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear that coming from them.\u201dHer fears are part of a broader concern among front-line workers and advocacy groups that they are being shut out of the process. Blaney said the consultations appear to be focused on families, and while it\u2019s important for them to have a voice, they\u2019re only one perspective.\u201cEach one has a unique story to tell and it\u2019s instructive in terms of the data and information that comes from those stories, and it can lead to healing of the families involved,\u201d she said.\u201cBut my position is that the women in the Downtown Eastside and other urban centres across this country are estranged from families.\u201dBlaney\u2019s committee advocates year-round for women in the city\u2019s troubled Downtown Eastside and is one of several groups, including Vancouver Rape Relief and Women\u2019s Shelter, that have sent a letter to Bennett asking for a special meeting.Rape Relief spokeswoman Hilla Kerner said approaching the inquiry using a feminist framework would mean examining the power relationships that have an impact on aboriginal women.\u201cAboriginal women are vulnerable to male violence first and foremost because they are women, then because they are aboriginal, and then because they are poor,\u201d she said. \u201cThe intersection between colonialism and sexism plays a crucial role.\u201dDawn Lavell-Harvard, president of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, is also calling on the government to hold separate meetings with front-line workers and grassroots groups.She said she was told before the meetings started that they were for families only.\u201cWe absolutely understand and respect the need for the families to go first,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just want to make sure that there is an opportunity for those meetings with those people who do the work on the ground.\u201dSabrina Williams, a spokeswoman for the ministry, said front-line organizations are invited to the meetings, which are scheduled to end in Ottawa on Feb. 15.She said participants have stressed the need for an inquiry to have an indigenous perspective and address the root causes of violence and the effects of residential schools.Some families have complained that the meetings are being rushed. Williams said every effort was being made to ensure relatives have as much notice as possible to participate.\u201cWe are trying to find the balance between people who want us to get on with the inquiry but also the fact that we want to get it right,\u201d she said in a statement.Candice Stevenson, whose mother went missing 33 years ago, said she only had a week\u2019s notice before the Vancouver meeting and she felt like she had to compete for a chance to talk.\u201cEverybody\u2019s rushed, rushed, rushed. People don\u2019t get to really speak their minds,\u201d she said.But she said the government shouldn\u2019t wait for the inquiry to take action on missing and murdered women, including increasing police resources to investigate cases.\u201cWe already know what\u2019s wrong. The violence against women, the systemic racism \u2014 we already know those problems exist.\u201d\u2014 Follow ellekane on Twitter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t      \u00a9\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            Copyright  (c)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t             The ProvinceOriginal source article:\u00a0Feminism missing from consultations on murdered women\u2019s inquiry: advocates\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleShare this Article\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0More on This Story\u00a0B.C. commits $3M to improve transportation safety along Highway of Tears'We need to get this right': B.C.'s missing-women groups urge caution before inquiry\u00a0Story Tools\u00a0E-mail this ArticlePrint this ArticleShare this Article\u00a0Font:*****\u00a0Image:****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0  Fay Blaney, centre, is pictured with Aborigal Womens Action Network member Mariee Williams, left,  and supporter Helen Michell, at a protest in Victoria in 2001.Photograph by: Peter Blashill, Vancouver Sun\u00a0   \u00a0\u00a0E-mail this GalleryPrint this GalleryShare this Gallery\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nPhoto Galleries \u00bb\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nMilan Fashion Week After Madonna's spectacular wardrobe...The cape is making a comeback in Milan this season...more \u00bbPrada explores cliches of beauty; Cavalli does BauhausGucci's break with the past exemplifies Milan fashion's mood of renewalBurberry, Hunter, Christopher Kane lead London Fashion Week Day 4Burberry goes bohemian in latest London showWestwood, Topshop lead London Fashion Week Day 3\u00a0  Prada explores cliches of beauty...Shape and colour engaged designers on the second day...more \u00bbGucci's break with the past exemplifies Milan fashion's mood of renewalBurberry, Hunter, Christopher Kane lead London Fashion Week Day 4Burberry goes bohemian in latest London showWestwood, Topshop lead London Fashion Week Day 3Sequins, retro elegance, Cinderella jostle for attention at second day of London Fashion Week\u00a0  Gucci's break with the past exemplifies...Fashion is always about renewal, but this round of...more \u00bbBurberry, Hunter, Christopher Kane lead London Fashion Week Day 4Burberry goes bohemian in latest London showWestwood, Topshop lead London Fashion Week Day 3Sequins, retro elegance, Cinderella jostle for attention at second day of London Fashion Week\u00a0  Alessandro Michele relaunches ...Alessandro Michele strove for discontinuity in his...more \u00bbBurberry, Hunter, Christopher Kane lead London Fashion Week Day 4Burberry goes bohemian in latest London showWestwood, Topshop lead London Fashion Week Day 3Sequins, retro elegance, Cinderella jostle for attention at second day of London Fashion WeekHigh collars, demure looks took over for revealing gowns on the Oscars red carpet\u00a0 \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nMore Photo Galleries. \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nnewsVancouverFeminism missing from consultations on murdered women\u2019s inquiry: advocates\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nLife Videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncanada.com\nE-mailed\nShared \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreaking out of a nightmarish bedtime routine\n\n\n\n\nThe end of Johnny Manziel in Cleveland?

A jury has finished hearing evidence in the trial for a man accused in the death of an Indigenous teen whose body was found wrapped in a duvet filled with rocks in Winnipeg's Red River. THE CANADIAN PRESS/John WoodsWINNIPEG - A jury has finished hearing evidence in the trial of a man accused in the death of an Indigenous teen whose body was found wrapped in a duvet filled with rocks in Winnipeg's Red River.The defence has closed its case without presenting any evidence in the second-degree murder trial of Raymond Cormier, who is 55.Cormier is accused of killing 15-year-old Tina Fontaine, whose 2014 death sparked renewed calls for a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women.The jury has heard that Tina was raised by her great-aunt on the Sagkeeng First Nation, but went to Winnipeg to visit her mother and became an exploited youth.Court was told there were no witnesses to Tina's death and no DNA linking her to the accused, while experts testified they don't know how she died.The jury is to hear closing arguments on Tuesday.Crown prosecutors closed their case on Wednesday by presenting audio recordings from a six-month undercover investigation. Police bugged Cormier's apartment and audio captured him, often mumbling and stuttering, telling multiple people he was attracted to Tina and had sex with her.In one recording, Cormier was heard telling a woman that he would make a bet that Tina was killed because \"I found out she was 15 years old.\"In another, Cormier was heard arguing with a woman, saying there was a little girl in a \"grave someplace screaming at the top of her lungs for me to finish the job. And guess what? I finished the job.''Defence lawyer Andrew Synyshyn told court the audio on the tapes could have been misheard and the transcripts could have errors.\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\nAdvertise With Us\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Error\nSubmit a Tip\nRefundRefund\n\n\n\nThe Brandon Sun is not accepting comments on this story.\nWhy aren't comments accepted on this story?

Her mother was found dead along Highway 16 near Prince Rupert in 1978 at the age of 31. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl DyckSMITHERS, B.C.  \u2013  Mary Jane Hill wasn\u2019t there to witness the birth of her grandchildren or to see them graduate from high school. She won\u2019t be there when her daughter needs her most, when she\u2019s in pain, or on her wedding day.\nThese are the losses Vicki Hill says she\u2019s suffered because of the death of her mother, whose naked body was found along British Columbia\u2019s Highway of Tears in 1978.\n\u201cI never knew her, but to me, in my eyes, she gave me life,\u201d Hill told the national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women on Tuesday. \u201cNow I have to live without her.\u201d\nHill was the first family member to testify at an inquiry hearing in Smithers, B.C., on Tuesday. She spoke softly and slowly, and her 15-year-old daughter, Zoey Hill-Harris, comforted her as tears rolled down her face.\nShe said she was only six months old when her mother died and has no memories of her. The murder was never solved and she has struggled to get information and documents from police, she said.\nHill read from a coroner\u2019s inquest report that concluded her 31-year-old mother died of bronchitis and pneumonia as a result of manslaughter. There was semen on her body and her clothes were discovered in an alley in Prince Rupert, 33 kilometres from where she was found dead, she said.\nDozens of women have died or gone missing along the stretch of Highway 16 between Prince Rupert and Prince George, which has become known as the Highway of Tears.\n\u201cI\u2019m not only speaking for my mom, I\u2019m speaking for the rest of the families. I feel their pain, I feel their hurt. I can see it. I\u2019m not afraid,\u201d she said. \u201cThings have got to change, no matter what.\u201d\nHill called on the commissioners to listen to families and bring them justice, adding she wants to see improved cellphone service and transportation along the Highway of Tears.\nThere is no cell service between Prince Rupert and Terrace, or in nearby Moricetown, she said, and she\u2019s never seen phone booths or emergency telephones, either.\nA British Columbia inquiry into missing and murdered women recommended bus service along the route, but it took years for the service to arrive, and some buses have to be caught in the middle of the night, she said.\nVivian Tom, chief of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en First Nation in Burns Lake, also spoke Tuesday. Her powerful testimony about her 21-year-old daughter Destiny Tom brought several observers to tears.\nTom recalled forgiving and hugging her daughter\u2019s common-law partner and killer, Garrett George, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to just over eight years in prison last November.\nShe also described a vision she had in church soon after her daughter\u2019s death. She saw her daughter\u2019s body, and she held her and rocked her in her arms, she said.\n\u201cI said, \u2018Destiny, I\u2019m so sorry! I\u2019m so sorry for what happened to you! I love you and I miss you. I\u2019m so sorry that you were all alone when this happened,\u2019 \u201d she said through sobs.\nTom said she then saw white wings sprout from her own shoulders and hands emerge from clouds above, then she flew with her daughter\u2019s body to place it gently in the hands.\nWhen she had her daughter\u2019s tombstone made, she made sure it had angel wings on it, she added.\nTom and her husband are raising their granddaughter, Cassidy, who is now seven. She was six when she talked about committing suicide, she said.\n\u201cIt just broke my heart,\u201d said Tom. \u201cShe figured that because the teenagers in our community attempted suicide \u2026 she figured, death, suicide, then she could be with her mom.\n\u201cI sat her on my lap, I said, \u2018Baby girl, if you commit suicide, you can\u2019t be with mom, because mommy fought hard for every breath.\u2019 \u201c\nThe inquiry has been plagued by controversy, with commissioner Marilyn Poitras resigning this summer and complaints from families about delays and poor communication.\nChief Commissioner Marion Buller said during opening remarks Tuesday that she and fellow commissioner Michele Audette will listen to families and survivors with open minds and open hearts.\nSmithers is the first of nine communities the inquiry will visit this fall. The hearings runs through Thursday.\n \u2013  Follow @ellekane on Twitter.\n0000000000\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nClick here to cancel reply.\n\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore ways to get to us\n\n Twitter\n Facebook\n Instagram\n YouTube\n Tumblr\n\n\nePaper Login\nSubscribe\nArchive\n \n\n\nAbout Us\n\nThe Medicine Hat News\nOther Publications\n Contact\nCareers\n \n\n\nContact the Medicine Hat News\n\n3257 Dunmore Rd SE\n\t\t\t\t\tMedicine Hat, AB T1B 3R2\n[P] 403.527.1101\n[F] 403.528.5696\n\n\nContact\nCareers\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrint Advertising: 403.528.5659\n\t\t\t\t\tNational Advertising: 403.528.5766\n\t\t\t\t\tOnline Advertising: 403.528.5698\n\t\t\t\t\tClassifieds: 403.526.7653\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 1996-2017 The Medicine Hat News, A Division of Continental Newspapers Canada Ltd.\nAdvertising\nTerms and Conditions & Privacy policy\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        THE CANADIAN PRESS\n                    \n\n                        Family and supporters of Thelma Favel, Tina Fontaine's great-aunt and the woman who raised her, march on Friday.\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWINNIPEG \u2014 Hundreds marched through the streets of Winnipeg a day after a jury acquitted a man accused of killing a 15-year-old Indigenous girl whose body, wrapped in a blanket and weighed down by rocks, was pulled from a river.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three-block-long march in support of Tina Fontaine's family began Friday in front of the courthouse and wound its way to the spot at the Red River where the teen's body was found in August 2014.\n\n\n\n\nSupporters carried signs reading No Justice No Peace, Justice for All and Love for Tina.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, a jury found Raymond Cormier, 56, not guilty of second-degree murder.\n\"We did what we could to bring justice for my baby girl,\" Thelma Favel, Tina's great-aunt who raised her, told the marchers. \"Tina, I know, is beside me right now and she's looking at you and appreciating everything that you're doing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIndigenous leaders speaking at the march reiterated that social services and the justice system are failing Indigenous youth. Fontaine was in government care and was staying at a hotel when she disappeared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is 2018. Canada, you've got to wake up. You talk about reconciliation. Now's the time to do it,\" said Chief Derrick Henderson of the Sagkeeng First Nation which was Tina's home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            THE CANADIAN PRESS\n            \n\n              Family and supporters of Thelma Favel,centre, Tina Fontaine's great-aunt and the woman who raised her, march on Friday.\n            \n\n\nAnishinaabe elder Chickadee Richard said Indigenous youth must be protected.\n\"Tina represents our babies and our babies are not safe out there,\" she said. \"There's monsters out there hurting our babies and I wonder when is this going to stop.\"\nThere were also calls for Cormier to face other charges related to his relationship with Tina.\n\"He should have been charged ... for at least rape and exploitation,\" said Marilyn Courchene, a Sagkeeng councillor.\nThe Crown had argued that a possible motive for the killing was that Cormier had found out how old Tina was. He admitted on undercover police tapes that he had sex with the teen and was heard saying he bet Tina was killed because he found out she was only 15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            THE CANADIAN PRESS\n            \n\n              Family and supporters of Thelma Favel, Tina Fontaine's great-aunt and the woman who raised her, march on Friday.\n            \n\n\nThe defence had argued that the tapes were hard to hear, that the transcriptions could be wrong and that Cormier's denial to police of any involvement was the real truth.\nThere was no DNA evidence linking him to Tina and experts could not determine how she died.\nScott Newman, a spokesman for the Criminal Defence Lawyers Association of Manitoba, said the jury came to a just conclusion.\n\"There were significant holes in the case that the Crown simply wasn't able to close. It's unfortunate that Mr. Cormier was held in custody and put on trial for a case that was as weak as this,\" Newman said Friday.\nHe said it could have saved lawyers a lot of trouble if Cormier had had a preliminary hearing to determine whether there was enough evidence to proceed. Instead, the Crown sent him directly to trial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            THE CANADIAN PRESS\n            \n\n              Family and supporters of Thelma Favel, Tina Fontaine's great-aunt and the woman who raised her, marched on Friday in Winnipeg.\n            \n\n\nNewman said he's not surprised at the outrage the case has stirred.\n\"The focus really needs to be on ... how do we make sure that this doesn't happen again? How are we going to protect future Tina Fontaines from finding themselves in a similar position?\"\nDavid Milward, an associate professor of law at the University of Manitoba, called the acquittal an injustice.\nHe said juries usually convict when they hear confessionary statements such as the ones Cormier made, even if there are other gaps in the case.\nBefore the Cormier verdict, Milward said, he always advised aspiring defence lawyers in his classes to do their utmost to get such remarks excluded so a jury never hears them.\n\"Because once it goes in, you're pretty much cooked,\" he said.\n\"But now it's almost like I'm tempted to tell the class ... except when an Aboriginal person's a victim, and then apparently you don't have anything to worry about.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            THE CANADIAN PRESS\n            \n\n              Family and supporters of Thelma Favel, Tina Fontaine's great-aunt and the woman who raised her, hold signs during a march on Friday.\n            \n\n\nNiigaan Sinclair, who teaches native studies at the University of Manitoba, said Fontaine's experience is linked to the unrelenting, brutal violence faced by Indigenous women and children.\n\"Injustice is a part of life for Indigenous people in this country,\" said Sinclair, whose father is Sen. Murray Sinclair, Manitoba's first aboriginal judge.\n\"If this isn't a wake-up for Canadians, I don't know what can be. Because these past two weeks have laid it bare that Indigenous Peoples never get justice in this country.\"\nWith files from Lauren Krugel in Calgary and Geordon Omand in Ottawa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggest a correction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanadian Press\n\n \n\n\nMORE:Indigenous rightsNewsRaymond CormierThelma FavelTina FontaineTina Fontaine marchWinnipeg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Trending\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake It From A Tax Lawyer: The Canada Revenue Agency Is Broken\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToutant Soars To Gold In Snowboard Big Air Event\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease Behold Team Canada Belting Out Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch: Jagmeet Singh\u2019s Big Fat Sikh Weddings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPot-Bellied Pig Adopted From B.C.

What can Australia learn from Canada\u2019s attempts to address the problem?\nNovember 21st 20177 hours ago/display/newscorpaustralia.com/Web/NewsNetwork/Entertainment - syndicated/\n\nSharon Nora Jane Abraham never got to say a proper goodbye to her family. Picture: CBCSource:SuppliedISABEL Fontaine never got to say a proper goodbye to the sister she helped raise.She had no idea what happened to her until she received the shocking news no family member ever wants to hear.Sharon Abraham was killed by Canada\u2019s worst serial killer, pig farmer Robert Pickton.In 2004, forensic evidence linked her to the farm after one of her fingernails was found and that was the only closure her family ever got.\u201cThey said she was tortured by the pigs, the pigs ate her,\u201d she tells Dateline reporter Laura Murphy-Oates. \u201cAnd all they found was the fingernail.\u201dThis handout photo shows an aerial view of the Pickton farm taken by police during their investigation in 2002. Picture: APSource:AAPPickton, a serial killer from British Columbia, was convicted in 2007 of killing women and butchering their remains at his pig farm.The remains of 33 women were found on his farm, but charges were never laid in Ms Abraham\u2019s case.The mother-of-five is one of thousands of indigenous women and girls who vanish across Canada every year and whose story features on Dateline tonight.While her family found out what happened to their loved one, others aren\u2019t so lucky.\n\nMurphy-Oates travelled to a Manitoba First Nation reserve in Canada where the cases of hundreds of missing and murdered indigenous women remain unsolved.She found a situation that mirrored things here Australia.The indigenous reporter said Aboriginal women both here in Australia and Canada face increased risk of violence.Many grow up with discrimination and inequality which makes them \u201cmore of a target.\u201d\u201cIn Australia, indigenous women are 32 times more likely to be hospitalised due to family-violence related assaults and six times more likely to be murdered,\u201d Murphy-Oates said.\u201cIt\u2019s eerie how much it (Canada) parallels things in Australia.\u201dBernice and Wilfred Catcheway have been searching for their daughter Jennifer for more than nine years. Picture: DatelineSource:SBSMurphy-Oates met with dozens of First Nations families who all had a familiar story when a loved one disappeared, often never to be found.She said she found family stories of police inaction in the cases of missing indigenous women and girls. Bernice and Wilfred Catcheway, whose daughter Jennifer vanished nine years ago, are among one of those families.They claim police told them the 18-year-old was probably out drinking, something which investigators refute.\u201cWe\u2019ve always believed that somebody knows something, we\u2019ve always said that,\u201d Ms Catcheway told Dateline. \u201cWomen, girls, they don\u2019t just go missing. Somebody stole them from us.\u201dThe family maintain screams were heard the day she went missing. They also claim police didn\u2019t act early enough to find their daughter, and being Aboriginal \u201cassumed she was out drinking\u201d.Beatrice Catcheway believes someone out there knows what happened to her daughter. Picture: DatelineSource:SBS\u201cPeople don\u2019t realise what we go through, people don\u2019t care,\u201d Mr Catcheway said.\u201cPolice didn\u2019t make a statement, they made a judgment call.\u201dSpeaking to news.com.au ahead of the documentary going to air, Murphy-Oates said these cases showed just how bad things really were for indigenous women in Canada.A 2014 landmark police report found almost 2000 indigenous women had been murdered or went missing in Canada between 1980 and 2012.Murphy-Oates said the native indigenous women\u2019s association of Canada claimed the actual figure was at least double that.Recent reports also show indigenous women were six times more likely to be murdered in Canada than other women, a figure she said was reflected in Australian statistics as well.Murphy-Oates said the problem was compounded by the fact that indigenous families felt police simply didn\u2019t listen or take action when they reported a loved one missing.Tina Fontaine\u2019s murder shocked Canada.Source:SBSIn 2015, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, sparked in part by the brutal murder of 15-year-old Tina Fontaine the previous year.First Nations politician Nahanni Fontaine has been supporting families of missing and murdered indigenous women for years and said things haven\u2019t gone far enough.\u201cIt all goes back to this colonial narrative of indigenous women being less than worthy and disposable, so if you\u2019re a serial killer or a misogynist (and) you want to kill women, who are you going to target?\u201d she said.Laura Murphy-Oates sits with Thelma Favel, whose niece Tina was murdered, and a First nation elder. Picture: DatelineSource:SBS\u201cThere was such inaction in respect of files for missing and murdered indigenous women and girls that people thought that they could just kill with impunity.\u201dMurphy-Oates said violence against indigenous women was a huge problem and there were no easy answers.However, she said she hoped the documentary would spark a broader discussion on family violence which included indigenous voices, and get people talking about an issue which affected all communities.Vanished: Canada\u2019s Missing Women on Dateline, tonight at 9.30pm on SBSContinue the conversation @DatelineSBS | @NewscomHQ | @lauramoatesNancy Bruyere is consoled after sharing the story of her niece who she believes was murdered.

Ultimate power.\u2019 What the Nova Scotia mass shooting tells us about toxic masculinityBy Shree ParadkarRace & Gender ColumnistFri., April 24, 2020timer4 min. readEvery time there is a mass killing, a few things happen quickly: Muslims pray the killer is not a Muslim; social media lights up with feverish speculation; police say little; politicians offer thoughts and prayers \u2014 and survivors are left reeling in the wake. The severity of damage is measured by the body count and journalists go into overdrive looking for answers \u2014 and labels. Worst mass shooting since. Worst ever. Many a time, these labels ignore colonial atrocities.In a previous role as breaking news editor, I learned to quickly scan the wires and assess the race of a suspect by the questions local reporters were asking police. A question on terrorism meant Muslim, gangs meant Black. \u201cWas mental health a factor?\u201d \u2014 ding ding \u2014 white. Mental health is code for exceptionalism, as the Mi\u2019kmaq lawyer Pam Palmater wrote in Now. A one-off from the benign normal. This is when the soft-focus headlines that humanize the killers crop up \u2014 descriptions of the Christchurch mosque gunman who killed 49 people last year as \u201clittle blond boy\u201d and \u201cangelic boy,\u201d and of the Las Vegas man who rained bullets on a concert in 2017 and killed 58 people as a \u201ckind, caring, quiet man.\u201d So the Globe and Mail was simply falling in line when it ran a headline online that read: \u201cNova Scotia mass shooter was a denturist with a passion for policing.\u201dMuch-deserved public outrage forced the paper to change this. Just as it was forced to change its victim-blaming headline a couple of years ago on the 2014 murder of First Nations teen Tina Fontaine saying she had \u201cdrugs, alcohol in her system when she was killed.\u201dBut let\u2019s talk about \u201cpassion for policing.\u201dJudith Taylor was a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2001 when a white teen who declared himself an \u201cangel of death\u201d drove his turbocharged Saab through a crowd on a street in Isla Vista, killing four people. She was a professor at the same university in 2014 when another white man stabbed, shot and mowed down people in Isla Vista killing six before turning the gun on himself. Both were spawns of rich Hollywood parents. The \u201cangel of death\u201d is now free after spending a decade in a mental institution; \u201cWas mental health a factor\u201d has powerful implications. The dead killer turned into an incel hero. Since then, Taylor, now a professor in the Department of Sociology and in the Women and Gender Studies Institute at the University of Toronto, asks students to read articles after mass killings and look for common threads.\u201cWhat\u2019s fascinating is \u2014 and I see it over and over again \u2014 how often shooters try to enter the military or the police at one point or another. They\u2019re drawn to having authority and using force,\u201d she said. The Montreal shooter in 1989, the Moncton, N.B. shooter in 2014, the Quebec mosque shooter in 2017, the Toronto van attack driver in 2018 and now the Nova Scotia shooter.The Nova Scotia gunman disguised himself as a police officer in a replica police cruiser and killed 22 people on April 18 and 19. The shootings provoke at least two troubling reflections: toxic masculinity \u2014 \u201cpassion for policing,\u201d and what society deems dangerous \u2014 in other words, who gets to get away. \u201cMaybe someone can explain to me why it\u2019s normal and healthy to collect police cars and outfits,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI feel that is a signal from that person that they feel disempowered and they\u2019d like a special car and a special outfit to make them be able to have absolute power. \u201cOf all the uniforms people can collect, why police? Because of what it symbolizes \u2014 alternate power, above the law. You can make anyone open their door, and you can make anyone stop their car.\u201d Then there is this.

Sometimes they\u2019re part of a hate group, sometimes involved in abuse. But many don\u2019t cause alarm.RELATED STORIESWhy the Star cannot hide a killer\u2019s name from you21 hrs ago Mounties lay out Nova Scotia killer\u2019s trail of murder and mayhem16 hrs ago Emergency alert issued over report of shots outside Halifax12 hrs ago \u201cThe reason police officers do not create profiles around these guys is because they resemble them,\u201d Taylor said.\u201cThe majority of law enforcement in Canada are white men who are interested in firearms, who are interested in having control and authority.\u201d Police brutality shows consistently that \u201cyou only recognize someone as scary if you can\u2019t identify with them. This is the crux of the matter.\u201d In a culture that lionizes the uniform, we seek to fulfil fantasies of perfection in soldiers, in police. That means police are allowed what Taylor calls \u201can acceptable abuse of power.\u201dOn April 6, D\u2019Andre Campbell, a Brampton man struggling with mental illness, called Peel police, his friend said, and died after being shot by them. In 2016, Whitby man Dafonte Miller lost an eye in a violent confrontation with off-duty police Const. Michael Theriault and his brother Christian Theriault.How do we understand the lure of a violent force for a person like the Nova Scotia killer who is likely to be written off as having a mental health problem?Taylor has an answer: \u201cUltimate authority.

Girvan. Published on Mar 16, 2018 2:00pm\n\n\n\n Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde poses for a photo at the Museum of History in Gatineau, Que., on Wednesday, February 21, 2018. iPolitics/Matthew Usherwood \n\n\nEmail\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\nPouring rain, framed by a six-storey wall of windows, provides the background for Assembly of First Nations (AFN) National Chief Perry Bellegarde\u2019s descent by escalator into the Museum of Canadian History\u2019s Grand Hall.\nStepping forward from suited staff to shake hands, his voice is surprisingly quiet and each answer he gives direct and poignant. The kindness and warmth for which he is reputed is ever present but there is little levity during this exchange and smiles are few.\nIt had been less than two weeks since Gerald Stanley was found not guilty in the shooting death of Colten Boushie, a young Indigenous man, with a jury soon expected to reach a verdict (which we now know was also \u2018not guilty\u2019) in the case of murdered First Nations teenager, Tina Fontaine, in a system where Bellegarde says, \u201cThere is no justice for First Nations people. The legal system is flawed.\u201d\nBellegarde was named National Chief of the AFN on December 10, 2014. An intergenerational survivor of the residential school system, Bellegarde grew up on Saskatchewan\u2019s Little Black Bear First Nation, Treaty 4 Territory, in a two-room house with his five brothers and parents, who remain his heroes. \u201cThere was no running water, we chopped wood, hunted, fished and trapped to survive. We were poor but I never knew it.\u201d\nAfter his father died when Bellegarde was 16, his mother raised the boys on her own. \u201cMy mother was really organized, everyone had a job and her venison stew with fresh bannock is still my favourite meal. She taught us the value of hard work and perseverance. Our seven sacred teachings of truth, honesty, love, respect, courage, wisdom and humility capture my mom\u2019s character and she instilled those things in all of us. She is still the captain of the ship and because her birthday is on February 2nd, we affectionately call her the Old Groundhog.\u201d\nAssembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde sits down with iPolitics journalist Chloe Girvan for an interview at the Museum of History in Gatineau, Que., on Wednesday, February 21, 2018. iPolitics/Matthew Usherwood\nBellegarde credits his parents for his academic and political pursuits, along with other First Nations role models. \u201cLeadership runs strong in Little Black Bear and File Hills.\u201d He also attributes his success to the great professional and personal partnership he shares with his wife Valerie Galley, mother of their three treasured boys, \u201cShe brings stability, balance and good vision with her strategic mind and outlook on things.\u201d\nRepresenting the interests of \u201c\u2026900,000 people living in 634 First Nation communities and in cities and towns across the country\u201d requires the National Chief to travel constantly. Last year he received a miniature airplane from Air Canada for completing his 1,000,000th mile in the air.\nFortunately, life on the road has only fueled Bellegarde\u2019s love of Canada, \u201cI love the diversity of Canada\u2019s people, especially First Nations people. I love that we can still do things as First Nations people in spite of the residential schools and the Indian Act. I also love the diversity in landscape. The vastness of the land, water and resources of this beautiful, rich country. It is great place to live.\u201d\nHis favourite Canadian season is spring. \u201cIt is a time of renewal and reawakening. Mother Earth is waking up and her white blanket is starting to melt. The flowers and grass are starting to pop up and energy is returning.\u201d\nAssembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde sits down with iPolitics journalist Chloe Girvan for an interview at the Museum of History in Gatineau, Que., on Wednesday, February 21, 2018. iPolitics/Matthew Usherwood\nWhen asked what Canada needs to change, Bellegarde doesn\u2019t hold back. \u201cUnfortunately, there is still a lot of racism and discrimination towards First Nations people in Canada. There are no better tools to eradicate this than education and awareness. Education and awareness create understanding, which leads to action in the form of policy and legislative changes or even just greater acceptance.\n\u201cCurricula need to be changed so that Canadian students are taught about the residential school system, The Indian Act, colonialism, treaties, inherent rights, aboriginal rights and First Nations languages.\n\u201cStudents should also learn about the positive contributions that First Nations people have made to Canada like bringing corn, beans and squash, syringes, toboggans, medicines and systems of governance.\n\u201cWe need to break down the stereotypes of First Nations people being dumb, stupid, lazy, drunk and on welfare. We need to challenge those misconceptions. Because we have First Nations people who are doctors, lawyers, business people and scientists. First Nations people are doing things in a really positive way and that is what should be taught and focused on.\u201d\nIf given the opportunity to publicly highlight an underreported issue affecting First Nations people, he would choose to showcase some of the good. \u201cWrite about some of the success stories like T\u2019sou-ke First Nation, outside of Victoria, which is solar powered, completely green and selling power back to the B.C. grid. I would send you to economically successful First Nations communities like Membertou, in Nova Scotia and Osoyoos, located in British Columbia\u2019s Okanagan Valley.\u201d\nIt is Bellegarde\u2019s dream to be remembered for helping to close the gap that exists between the quality of life for First Nations and non-First Nations people in Canada.\nAccording to the AFN website, \u201cThe gap between First Nations and Canada is well documented. In recent years, Canada has ranked between 6th and 8th on the UN Human Development Index while First Nations fall between 63rd and 78th. The federal government\u2019s Community Well-Being Index shows that the gap has not changed at all since 1981.\u201d\nTo Bellegarde, this gap represents everything he and his team are trying to fix. \u201cIt represents the 1,200 missing and murdered indigenous girls, the 40,000 First Nations children in foster care, our high suicide rates, boil water advisories, overcrowded housing, poor healthcare in the North, caps on education and the high numbers of our people in jail.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau laughs with Assembly of First Nations Chief Perry Bellegarde during National Indigenous Peoples Day celebrations in Ottawa on Wednesday, June 21, 2017. iPolitics/Matthew Usherwood\n\u201cFirst Nations people just want the same quality of life as everyone else. The want this gap closed. This country was founded on peaceful coexistence and mutual respect and we were to jointly benefit from sharing the land and resource wealth but that is not what we see. We see 6th versus 63rd. We see poverty. Fixing that gap together would be a legacy.\u201d\nAs for what non-First Nations Canadians can do if they wish to help, Bellegarde has simple suggestions. \u201cSupport federal and provincial leaders who are working towards implementing initiatives to affect First Nations people in a positive way and write to your politicians. Attend a pow wow and meet First Nations people. Challenge your own misconceptions, break bread together and build relationships.\u201d\nDespite frustration and so much work left to be done, Bellegarde is optimistic and is a firm believer in the value of hope. \u201cOne of our elders\u2019 biggest teachings is to always try to leave more hope in a room than when you walked in, because there may be no hope. You want to leave people with hope that things can get better and can get fixed with persistence and tenacity. That we will provide a better future for our children and those yet unborn.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRespond to the Story Cancel reply \nYour email address will not be published.Comment Name *\nEmail *\n \n\n Notify me of new posts by email. \n\nBy posting a comment you are accepting our commenting rules and terms of use.\n\n\n\n\nWeekender 11 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niPolitics publishes content everyday, throughout the day.\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain\nNews\nPolicy\nBriefs\nOpinions\n \n\nAbout iPolitics\nAbout Us\nWork With Us\nGroup Plans & Corporate Access\nAdvertising\nTerms of Use\nCancellation/Refund Policy\nContact\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2018 iPolitics.

He said his mother Jane Dick was beaten to death after he and his siblings were taken from her by child welfare agents in the 1960s and placed in non-indigenous homes.\n\u201cThe effect it had on me is very simple. I don\u2019t know how to love. I was never taught that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got three beautiful boys out there and I can\u2019t even tell them I love them because I don\u2019t know what the heck that word means.\n\u201cThe effect it had on me is it drove me down to Vancouver and stuck a needle up my arm for 13 years, trying to kill the pain.\u201d\nLadue said he doesn\u2019t trust the inquiry because all government has ever done is hurt him, take him away from his parents and throw his people in jail. He urged the commissioners to do more than just talk and to take action to elevate indigenous people in society.\nLadue said he has held the bitterness inside for decades.\n\u201cDealing with this today, for me, is letting go of something that I haven\u2019t let go of for 52 years, and that\u2019s the anger I have towards the government officials and the anger I have towards the RCMP.\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust. You want my trust, you\u2019ve got to earn my trust.If I see this fall apart, I\u2019ll never trust again.\u201d\nSeveral listeners, including commissioner Qajaq Robinson, were crying by the end of Ladue\u2019s testimony.\nThe first family hearings held by the national inquiry began on Tuesday and will wrap up Thursday with a closing ceremony. Chief Commissioner Marion Buller has said it is crucial to the inquiry that hearings be successful, and families are split on whether that was the case.\nShaun LaDue, who uses a capital D in his last name unlike his brother, said he felt respected and heard after testifying about their mother.\n\u201cThe hearings so far to me seem to be going very good. The commissioners are listening to us with their heart and their soul and they\u2019re very responsive to what the Yukon First Nations families have to say about the missing and murdered women,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\u201cI have good hope, a big, strong hope, that when they go across Canada, people will see that they\u2019re working their hardest.\u201d\nJoan Jack, a lawyer and family member of a murdered woman, criticized the quasi-judicial format of the inquiry. She said the formal processes of the inquiry, including the swearing-in of witnesses, is making many participants uncomfortable.\nShe also wanted to know why the inquiry\u2019s lead legal counsel is not indigenous.\nJack said all Canadians need to hear the uncomfortable truths revealed during testimony to the inquiry, saying that while the details are disturbing, the only way to make progress is if everyone suffers together.\nThe inquiry has faced criticism from families and advocates across the country about delays and poor communications. Other community hearings won\u2019t be held until the fall.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

Minister Valcourt committed just over a month ago at the National Roundtable on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, to work with us on coordinated action to prevent and address violence.\u00a0 He cannot in good faith continue withholding information.\"\n\n\nThe National Roundtable on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls was held February 27, 2015 with commitments by all jurisdictions on the development of a national prevention and awareness campaign, a National Justice Forum to be hosted in Manitoba and for the group to\u00a0 meet again next year to discuss progress.\u00a0 First Nations continue to call for a National Public Inquiry as a tool to identify and address root causes, including the impacts of colonialism on First Nations.\u00a0 \n\nFor more information on work toward an action plan to end violence and support for a National Public Inquiry please visit:\u00a0 http://www.afn.ca/index.php/en/policy-areas/i-pledge.-end-violence.\n\n\nThe Assembly of First Nations is the national organization representing First Nations citizens in Canada.\u00a0 Follow AFN on Twitter @AFN_Comms, @AFN_Updates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nSOURCE  Assembly of First Nations\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\tFor further information: Jenna Young Castro AFN Communications Officer 613-241-6789, ext 401; 613-314-8157 or jyoung@afn.ca; Alain Garon AFN Bilingual Communications Officer 613-241-6789, ext 382; 613-292-0857 or agaron@afn.ca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n        French version\n        \n\n\n\nOrganization Profile\n\n\n\n\n\n              \n              Assembly of First Nations\n\n\nVisit website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2015 CNW Group Ltd.\n\n\nFran\u00e7ais\n\nPrivacy & Terms of Use\nCareers\nMedia Partners\nRSS Feeds\nTwitter\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Credit: Hiba ZayadinThe Red Dresses Project Is a Poignant Reminder of Canada\u2019s Missing & Murdered Indigenous Women  \n\nHiba ZayadinMarch 22nd, 2017\n\n\n\nOver the past few days, bright red dresses hanging from trees in and around the University of Toronto\u2019s downtown campus have been hauntingly blowing in the wind. They symbolize a human rights issue long overlooked in Canada \u2014 \u00a0one involving thousands of indigenous women\u00a0who have been missing or murdered over the last thirty years across the country. \nThe powerful installation is the work of Canadian artist Jamie Black and is her biggest yet. \u201cThrough the installation I hope to draw attention to the gendered and racialized nature of violent crimes against Aboriginal women and to evoke a presence through the marking of absence,\u201d Black wrote on the website dedicated to the project. \nWhile a 2014 police report puts the number of indigenous women murdered or missing in the last three decades at 1,200, research by the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, as well as activists within indigenous communities, suggests the number is closer to 4,000. Even if accepting the very conservative police estimate,\u00a0young aboriginal women are five times more likely than other Canadian women of the same age to die of violence. And yet, Canadian law enforcement agencies have treated attacks against indigenous women as isolated incidents, for far too long. \u00a0\nWhile there has recently been an uptick in media coverage of this critical national issue, Canadian newspapers have not devoted nearly enough resources to aboriginal issues, making efforts like the red dress project all the more important to provoking a reaction from the government and public.\nRed dresses can be seen hanging from the trees on the University of Toronto campus this week as part of the REDress Project, which brings attention to Canada\u2019s missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.\nFor over a decade, there has been an increasing demand for the government to address the violence experienced by Indigenous women, from\u00a0affected families, survivors, community groups, and international human right bodies. In September 2016, the Canadian government finally responded with the launch of an independent National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls to examine and report on the systemic causes of this violence.\u00a0\nAlthough a laudable effort, the inquiry has\u00a0fallen short of expectations. Just two months before independent commissioners will hear from those who have lost loved ones, it appears the inquiry has only gathered ninety victim names. As a result, family members are starting to express concern about the process and question the government\u2019s promise to seek and honor the truth. \u00a0\nThe red dresses mysteriously swaying in the wind will soon be taken down and the conversations surrounding their presence will dissipate, but those who have lost sisters and daughters will continue to demand answers for the disproportionate violence afflicting their communities. Until these answers are provided, the weight of their loved one\u2019s absence will lie on the shoulders of every sector of Canadian society. \n \n{\"data\":[{\"ID\":46431,\"post_author\":\"1\",\"post_date\":\"2016-11-30 00:05:14\",\"post_date_gmt\":\"2016-11-30 05:05:14\",\"post_content\":\"\",\"post_title\":\"ANERA Nov 30, 2016 onwards\",\"post_excerpt\":\"\",\"post_status\":\"publish\",\"comment_status\":\"open\",\"ping_status\":\"closed\",\"post_password\":\"\",\"post_name\":\"anera-nov-30-2016-onwards\",\"to_ping\":\"\",\"pinged\":\"\",\"post_modified\":\"2017-02-14 17:18:53\",\"post_modified_gmt\":\"2017-02-14 22:18:53\",\"post_content_filtered\":\"\",\"post_parent\":0,\"guid\":\"http:\\/\\/muftah.org\\/?post_type=adverts&p=46431\",\"menu_order\":0,\"post_type\":\"adverts\",\"post_mime_type\":\"\",\"comment_count\":\"0\",\"filter\":\"raw\"},{\"ID\":40154,\"post_author\":\"4\",\"post_date\":\"2016-02-29 08:10:55\",\"post_date_gmt\":\"2016-02-29 08:10:55\",\"post_content\":\"\",\"post_title\":\"MADEO Animated\",\"post_excerpt\":\"\",\"post_status\":\"publish\",\"comment_status\":\"open\",\"ping_status\":\"closed\",\"post_password\":\"\",\"post_name\":\"madeo-animated\",\"to_ping\":\"\",\"pinged\":\"\",\"post_modified\":\"2016-11-14 07:41:20\",\"post_modified_gmt\":\"2016-11-14 12:41:20\",\"post_content_filtered\":\"\",\"post_parent\":0,\"guid\":\"http:\\/\\/muftah.org\\/?post_type=adverts&p=40154\",\"menu_order\":2,\"post_type\":\"adverts\",\"post_mime_type\":\"\",\"comment_count\":\"0\",\"filter\":\"raw\"}],\"next_index\":0} \n\nSupport our work.

Shener remarked,\n\u201cYou can\u2019t look at any of these issues in isolation, and that\u2019s what the former government was doing. The contributing factors, such as residential schools, cultural genocide, and racism\u2026 you can\u2019t tease out any one issue. It\u2019s a large & wide reaching issue & requires a wide reaching response.\u201d\nOppal agreed, saying, \u201cThe Pickton Inquiry looked at the police actions around Robert Pickton. This one can look at why were the women on the streets. What can we do to prevent women from becoming vulnerable?\u201d\nOppal strongly endorsed the appointment of Judge Marion Buller as the chair of the panel running this inquiry. \u201cShe\u2019s well qualified \u2013 of Aboriginal background of course, but beyond that, she\u2019s been on the Provincial Court for many years, and been dealing with offenders of many backgrounds\u2026 I have a lot of confidence in her.\u201d\nLaPointe asked Shener if he thought the country was \u201cready\u201d for what this inquiry might reveal.\nShener, who has been an outspoken critic of the way the Vancouver Police handled the Pickton investigation, didn\u2019t mince words. \u201cI don\u2019t care if they\u2019re ready. They have to be ready. Canadians have created this issue and it\u2019s like a lot of hard questions\u2026 you may or may not be ready to face the resolution of these problems \u2013 but too bad, because it has to happen. Indigenous people and people who see the problem are demanding it.\u201d\nResponding to complaints about the cost of the inquiry, (53.8 million dollars has been set aside), Shener said, \u201c\u2026. It\u2019s a wide-ranging problem that requires a wide-ranging response.\nI think most Canadians are well-meaning and well-intentioned, but have lacked the education to understand the indigenous experience in Canada. Now they\u2019re going to get an education on what it\u2019s like to be an indigenous person in Canada.\nAsked whether the inquiry would be able to look at unsolved cases, Oppal was careful to point out that doing so could jeopardize open investigations. He did say, however, that families should have the opportunity to be heard, even if police could not present the contents of the ongoing files.\nLaPointe asked if the stated goal of the inquiry, \u201cto help bring a national tragedy to an end,\u201d was an achievable one. Shener said, \u201cThe trick will be if the inquiry is allowed to do its full work and get into the systems that perpetuate racism. So looking at the justice system, policing, social services.\u201d\u00a0 Shener said despite the shortcoming of the justice system, he is optimistic \u2013 and that Minister Bennett is \u201cvery aware of the issues.\u201d\nOppal said, \u201cAnybody who was cynical about everything \u2013 that cynicism has to be replaced. The government have shown they are sincere, and appointed a blue ribbon panel & given them unlimited power to go & examine the issues.\u201d\nHis hopes for how the panel will conduct itself? \u201cI hope they go & listen to the people who have been victims of violence. Have those people tell them what it\u2019s like to live on reserve, talk about why so many leave reserves, go to the city, and become victims of violence. I hope they make reasonable findings based on this, so the government can act upon them.\u201d\nChoice, and relatively upbeat words from two people who have closely examined the issues.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\nShare This\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading\n\n\n\n\n\n                Leave a comment:\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nSubscribe to comments\n\n\n\n\n\nComment\nLike\n\n\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\nBe the first to comment here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Reset Password\n            \n\n                Simply confirm your registered email address below and click \"Reset Password.\" We will immediately email you a link back to the site where you can enter a new password for this account.\n            \n\nAccount E-mail:\n\n\n\nPlease type your account e-mail address.\n\n\n\n\n\n Enter your email and password below.\n\n\n\nAccount E-mail:\n\n\nPlease type your e-mail address.\n\n\n\nPassword (Case Sensitive):\n\n\n\nPlease type your password.\n\n\nKeep me logged in for 2 weeks.\n\nReset your password\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin with Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've found your existing Member Club account.

The event also commemorated 10 women who have been murdered on P.E.I. since 1989. - Stu Neatby - Stu Neatby\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHARLOTTETOWN, P.E.I. \u2014 \nCharlottetown\u2019s 30th annual memorial of the Montreal Massacre concluded with a song about resilience in the face of injustice.\nThree members of the all-women choir group Sirens performed the song \"Warrior\" by Kim Baryluk. The three-verse song tells the story of a \u201cshy and lonely girl\", a child who feels powerless. In the song, the child eventually grows up to be a woman who has found her voice and who \u201ccan and will a warrior be\".\n\"We thought it would be an appropriate piece because it's about finding that personal power to stand up to injustice in the world,\" said Kate Dempsey, a member of Sirens.\nThe Memorial Hall of the Confederation Centre was packed as hundreds turned out to mark the anniversary of the 1989 killing of 14 women in Montreal at \u00c9cole Polytechnique. The killings were carried out by Marc L\u00e9pine, who had penned an anti-feminist manifesto beforehand.\n\n\nA bouquet of roses is set up at a memorial event in Charlottetown commemorating the 1989 murder of 14 women at Montreal\u2019s \u00c9cole Polytechnique. The roses each represented one of the women killed on Dec. 6, 1989, as well as all 10 women who have been murdered on P.E.I. since that time. - Stu Neatby\n\n\n\nAt a glance\nFourteen women were killed in Montreal by Marc L\u00e9pine on Dec. 6, 1989.

The event also commemorated 10 women who have been murdered on P.E.I. since 1989. - Stu Neatby\n\n\n\nDeborah Langston, chair for the P.E.I. Advisory Council on the Status of Women, acted as emcee of an even commemorating the the 1989 murder of 14 women at \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Montreal. - Stu Neatby\n\nThe Charlottetown Dec. 6 memorial also commemorated the 10 women who have been murdered on P.E.I. since 1989.\n\"Men they knew and loved were convicted, charged or implicated in their death,\u201d Deborah Langston of the P.E.I. Advisory Council on the Status of Women told the audience.\n\u201cThese murders were not chance or coincidence. We must act in memory of all murdered women in Canada \u2013 all victims of violence against women and all victims of family violence.\"\nLangston also made reference to the release earlier this year of a report from the National Inquiry Into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\n\"Indigenous women continue to die and go missing every week in Canada,\u201d Langston said.\n\nFeatured speaker Dawn Wilson during a memorial event in Charlottetown commemorating the 1989 murder of 14 women at \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Montreal. - Stu Neatby\n\nDawn Wilson, the featured speaker for the memorial, spoke about her personal experiences. By 1989, as a young child, she had already stayed twice in Anderson House, P.E.I.\u2019s emergency shelter for women facing violence.\u00a0\n\"I was already terribly familiar with the fear of gender-based violence,\" Wilson said.\n\"After returning from one stay at Anderson House, I can vividly recall sitting in our family vehicle in the driveway and listening to my father tell my mother that if she left with us again, he would kill her and bury her body in the backyard.\"\nWilson described the terror she felt at the time but also spoke of the support and courage shown to her and her mother from other family members.\n\u201cTo the survivors and their supporters in the room today, thank you for stepping up when you were called. I see how brave you have been,\u201d Wilson said.\nWilson has since begun working at Anderson House. She said the work has made her fully realize the toll the current housing crisis has taken on vulnerable women.\n\"It's clear we must tackle the difficult and necessary work of eliminating gender-based violence. And it will require all of us, working together as individuals and organizations, institutions and governments,\" Wilson said.\nTwitter.com/stu_neatby\n\n\nAllison Kelly, Marlee Saulnier and Kate

Shane Gottfriedson told a special meeting of chiefs that the post, a picture of his legs with an emoji in his groin area, was not his finest moment. Gottfriedson says he spoke to AFN National Chief Perry Bellegarde directly about the matter. Bellegarde hugged Gottfriedson after he apologized to the meeting. The organization has yet to indicate who will replace Gottfriedson in the portfolio. Hearings are expected to begin early next year to examine the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women\u2026. \nThis content is for Yearly Subscription and Trial Subscription members only.Log In Register\nAdd Your Voice\nIs there more to this story?

(VIDEO CAPTURE) (Updated 5 p.m. Aug. 3)\nPledging to do an \u201cunflinching\u201d examination of the root causes of violence against Indigenous women and girls, three federal ministers on Aug. 3 announced who will sit on their long-awaited Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Woman and Girls and how the inquiry will work.\nOttawa will spend $53.86 million on the inquiry, which is expected to complete its work in about two years, by end of 2018.\nThe commission of inquiry\u2019s work will likely start Sept. 1, 2016 and continue until Dec. 31, 2018.\nAt the same time, Justice Canada will spend $11.67 million over three years to help the families of murdered and missing Indigenous women communicate with police and justice system officials, and to help ease their trauma, Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould announced.\nAnd Justice Canada will spend another $4.5 million on victim\u2019s services, Wilson-Raybould said.\nThat money, $16.7 million in total, will be distributed among provincial and territorial governments, who are responsible for justice and policing in Canada.\nCarolyn Bennett, the minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs, said all provincial and territorial governments in Canada have now signed on to the inquiry.\nThat\u2019s important, because it allows the inquiry to look into policing and justice matters that fall under provincial-territorial jurisdiction.\nPatty Hajdu, the minister responsible for the status of women, said the inquiry will cast an \u201cunflinching gaze\u201d at the systemic problems that have led to the highly disproportionate number of deaths.\n\u201cEvery Indigenous woman and girl has the right to live free of violence,\u201d Hajdu said.\nThe five commissioners, whose names have already been leaked to the media are:\n\u2022 Commission Chair Marion Buller, a First Nations judge who sits on the B.C. provincial court;\n\u2022 Mich\u00e8le Audette, the former president of Femmes autochtones du Qu\u00e9bec;\n\u2022 Qajaq Robinson, a Nunavut-born Inuktitut-speaking lawyer who is vice president of Tungasuvvingat Inuit and who also worked as a Crown prosecutor in Nunavut for four years;\n\u2022 Marilyn Poitras, a M\u00e9tis lawyer who is an assistant professor of law at the University of Saskatchewan; and\n\u2022 Brian Eyolfson, a First Nations lawyer who now works as an acting deputy director at the Ontario ministry of aboriginal affairs.\n\u201cThey will listen in French, English and Inuktitut,\u201d Bennett said of the five commissioners.\nThe inquiry commissioners will also have the ability, if they choose, to create regional and issue-specific advisory committees composed of elders, youth, family members of victims, local organizations, and representatives of national Indigenous organizations.\n\u201cWe were told it should not have a one-size-fits-all approach and must recognize the diversity of indigenous peoples in Canada and the regional differences,\u201d Bennett said at the Aug. 3 press conference.\nThe commission\u2019s marching orders state that is mandated to look at and report on the systemic causes of violence against Indigenous women and girls and why they are more vulnerable to such violence.\n\u201cThe underlying factors could be historical, social, economic, institutional or cultural \u2013 it will be up to the commission to decide what underlying factors it will decide to examine and report on,\u201d a federal government document said.\nAnd that will include policing, child welfare, coroners, and other government policies and practices.\nHajdu said it\u2019s clear that Indigenous women and girls have been victimized by many years of colonialist and racist government practices.\n\u201cChanging these attitudes and practices will require a steady and an honest gaze. Just as important, the inquiry must also examine how racism and sexism are embedded in the very institutions that are supposed to help and protect women and girls,\u201d Hajdu said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(16) Comments:\n#1.\u00a0Posted by  Whatever happened to the \"nation to nation\" relati on August 03, 2016\n\nInuit do not call themselves a nation but the intent is to treat indigenous Canadians as equal human beings.\u00a0 This is a throwback to the good old days were Inuit were a subspecies and require more superior human beings to represent them.\nInuit women have spoken and this government has broken their promise to Inuit.\u00a0 Down with the lying liberals!\nI shall not vote for them again.\n\n\n#2.\u00a0Posted by  Oh my GOD! on August 03, 2016\n\n#1 Oh yes, the drama\u2026 I can see the ovens are being warmed up to fry the Inuit. Just like the old days..\nPlease\u2026\n\n\n#3.\u00a0Posted by  North on August 03, 2016\n\nIt is quite shameful that the province with the largest aboriginal population does not have the chair position let alone a person on the board at all. I do not blame Manitoba one bit for dragging their feet and trying to get this right. 50 million to figure out what is already known. The people and the people alone have the power to change and expect better the government can and will not change one thing other than opening channels of communication.\n\n\n#4.\u00a0Posted by  Trauma Counsellor on August 03, 2016\n\n#1 if you want to look at a \u00e2\u0080\u009cthrowback to the good old days\u00e2\u0080\u009d you should take a long hard look at Pauktuutit. Pauktuutit tells everyone that it is an Inuit organization but Pauktuutit is run totally by non-Inuit.\nThis is why the federal government and everyone else does not take Pauktuutit seriously. They listen to Inuit Tapiriit but they do not listen to Pauktuutit. \nBy the way, hysteria will get you nowhere. No one will listen to comments like yours unless you learn to communicate normally.\n\n\n#5.\u00a0Posted by  Imagine on August 03, 2016\n\nImagine how many homes could be built for Inuit and First Nations with 54 million dollars? Imagine how many First Nations people who live without potable water could have it with 58 million dollars?\u00a0 We all know the systemic factors which place aboriginal women at risk of being murdered or seriously harmed. Those factors have to do with poverty, and family dysfunction brought on by poverty and poor living conditions. Those factors lead to low education and low self esteem which, in turn lead to high risk lifestyles. Why not use the 54 million to start addressing those factors now!\n\n\n#6.\u00a0Posted by  Naulii Inukaatika? on August 03, 2016\n\nSo happy for the First Nations and depressing same old for the Inuit.\u00a0 The First Nations get their commissioners and none for us Inuit.\u00a0 When are we going to be good enough to represent ourselves in front of the government?\n\n\n#7.\u00a0Posted by  Holly Jarrett on August 03, 2016\n\nAm disappointed that there is not an inuk as a commissioner. Qajaq Robinson IS Nunavut Born and speaks Inuktitut but is not an inuk woman.\nShe is an amazing activist and lawyer and knows her stuff\u2026 but again\u2026 our Inuk women are not held to their highest standard\u2026 and again\u2026 as we see with pauktuutit,\u00a0 non inuk women are in our lead\u2026 and supported by inuk men to get there.\u00a0 I fought hard and long for this inquiry to happen\u2026 pauktuutit only contacted me to vy with them against Qajaq\n... I support her as I don\u2019t think all the blame rests on her shoulders and now we must work together to love forward.\nI am an inuk.\u00a0 I speak up and speak out with these issues\u2026 however\u2026 when asked for Inuit Womens input\u2026. it\u2019s dead silence\u2026 could this be due to system oppression? Always allowing non inuit women to lead\u2026 what does this say to our young inuit women?\u00a0 Hopeful\u2026 but concerned.\n\n\n#8.\u00a0Posted by  Pauktutiit not a representation org on August 03, 2016\n\nI am in Inuk woman. Someone tell me, how does Pauktutiit represent me?\n\n\n#9.\u00a0Posted by  jenny tookalook on August 03, 2016\n\n#5 - I thought the same thing.\u00a0 This all sounds now like jumping hoops.\u00a0 I could think of lots of ways to benefit peoples\u2019 lives in communities with that kind of money.\u00a0 So where will that 50+ million go again?\n\n\n#10.\u00a0Posted by  In addition to a 6th commissioner... on August 03, 2016\n\nI call on Pauktutiit to have a second Executive Director who is Inuk and speaks Inuktitut (and as Rebecca Kublu says, speaks Inuktitut in ALL dialects because it is 2016 afterall).\n\n\n#11.\u00a0Posted by  Shake my head on August 03, 2016\n\n#3 The only thing shameful is your comment. Are indigenous people from BC not \u2018indigenous\u2019 enough for you? How stupid.\n\n\n#12.\u00a0Posted by  #8 you ask on August 03, 2016\n\nPauktuutit are asking that you be represented in ending violence against Inuit women.\u00a0 They are representing you the best way they can.\nAn inquiry without any Inuit in it does not represent you one bit.\n\n\n#13.\u00a0Posted by  detlef on August 04, 2016\n\nInteresting  -there is a Nunavummiut that is educated, has been around the block and has experience, AND is a woman, and now Inuit are bitching about that they are not represented\u2026.hahahahaha - discrimination goes full circle\n\n\n#14.\u00a0Posted by  Woman on August 04, 2016\n\nQajaq could step down. It is imperative that an INUK sit in a seat.\u00a0 No results or work will be complete unless this oversight is rectified. \nSpeaking Inuktitut does NOT make you an Inuk (NOTE: many in France are fluent).\u00a0 Just as, NOT speaking Inuktitut doesn\u2019t make you white! \nThe decision makers mixed up, the knowledge of language with the blood or culture.\n\n\n#15.\u00a0Posted by  Pauktuutit on August 04, 2016\n\npauktuutit keep the voice strong for inuit to be represented on this panel.\u00a0 the problem is that it will also never be good enough because others are represented but inuit are not. the selection panel could replace qajaq.\n\n\n#16.\u00a0Posted by  gena on August 04, 2016\n\nvoice rep worth 50 million, is this a joke?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Email:\n\n\n\nYour Name: \n\n\n Remember my personal information\n\n\nYour Location:\n\n\n\nYour comment: \n\n\n Notify me of follow-up comments?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEWS\nFEATURES\nEDITORIAL\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nTAISSUMANI\nCOMMENTARY\nNEWS TIPS\nPRIVACY POLICY\nCOMMENTING POLICY\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0THIS WEEK\u2019S ADS\n\n\nJOBS\nTENDERS\nNOTICES\n\n\n\u00a0ADVERTISING\n\n\nRATE CARD/MEDIA KIT\nEMAIL AD DEPARTMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 1995-2016 Nortext Publishing Corporation (Iqaluit) and may not be reprinted for commercial publication in print, or any other media, without the permission of the publisher. \n\n\nNunatsiaq News, PO Box 8, Iqaluit, NU X0A 0H0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Ph.

(PHOTO COURTESY OF GOV. OF CANADA) An obituary for the late Betsy Kalaserk, who died in 2003. Kalaserk's family in Rankin Inlet have invited the MMIWG inquiry to host a hearing in the Kivalliq community.  When Laura MacKenzie first heard about the launch of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, she knew it would be a good opportunity to bring healing and closure to her home community of Rankin Inlet.\nAlmost 14 years ago and a territory away, MacKenzie\u2019s aunt, Betsy Kalaserk, was found dead in her family\u2019s Yellowknife apartment.\nKalaserk\u2019s husband, Ian Adam Kirby, was later convicted of criminal negligence causing the 29-year-old woman\u2019s 2003 death.\nMore than a decade later, Kalaserk\u2019s absence is still mourned by her large family in Rankin Inlet.\nThat\u2019s why MacKenzie sought the support of the hamlet and other organizations to invite the inquiry to host a hearing in Rankin Inlet, to hear Kalaserk\u2019s story and that of other women who have been murdered or gone missing.\n\u201cI want to be able to speak on behalf of my late aunt,\u201d MacKenzie said.\n\u201cAs bad as this is, we can learn from this. This is what we can do to ensure there no more victims.\u201d\nRankin Inlet is the first Inuit community to officially extend an invitation to the commission, which plans to begin hosting community visits in the fall, although it has yet to say where and when.\nPauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada, which recently gained standing to take part in the inquiry on behalf of Inuit women, has suggested the commission visit eight different Inuit communities in additional to hosting Inuit-specific sessions in six different southern cities.\nAlthough it\u2019s gotten off to a rocky start, the commission is stepping up its efforts to ensure it can accommodate Inuit families across Inuit Nunangat.\nIt\u2019s done that, in part, by hiring a number of Inuit staff including a new community liaison worker for Inuit, Looee Okalik.\nOkalik will soon begin to go into Inuit regions and urban sites to make contact with the families of victims and community organizations who\u2019ll take part in upcoming hearings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important that Inuit reach out to us when the time comes,\u201d Okalik said.\n\u201cWe need family members to be spokespeople in order to produce good recommendations.\u201d\nTo help with that process, the inquiry has hired Inuit lawyers, researchers and Inuit Family Advisory Circle members in each Inuit region to do local outreach.\nSo far, most of the Inuit who\u2019ve come forward to testify or share their stories are from the Nunatsiavut region, Okalik said, but she hopes to see that grow as regional representatives meet directly with families.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be guiding us throughout the process to ensure that we\u2019re responsive and respectful,\u201d she said.\nOkalik notes that Inuit have had different lived experiences than those of First Nations and M\u00e9tis, which present distinct needs for the inquiry to consider.\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve had to do our own teachings in the [commission] office so they can have a better picture of where we\u2019re coming from,\u201d Okalik said. \n\u201cThis way Inuit will feel more comfortable and competent to tell their stories.\u201d\nShould the inquiry visit Rankin Inlet, MacKenzie said her key concerns are mental health support and privacy for the families involved. \n\u201cThis is a very personal journey for people,\u201d said MacKenzie, who worked for years as president of Rankin\u2019s Kataujaq women\u2019s shelter.\n\u201cDown south, people have family doctors they can make an appointment with any time, but we don\u2019t have that,\u201d she noted.\n\u201cWe need to ensure that when we\u2019re revisiting trauma, that there are mechanisms in place to deal with that before, during and after.\u201d\nFor all the pain the inquiry may uncover in Nunavut, she believes the process will make her family stronger.\nMacKenzie has yet to receive a response from inquiry staff, but she said she\u2019d rather the commission take the time it needs to get it right.\n\u201cI\u2019m just waiting patiently,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI know people are saying it\u2019s taking too long, but for me, I would rather wait for them to set the ground work. It\u2019s already been 13 years\u2014I can wait.\u201d\nFamilies and individuals who wish to get in touch with the commission can call toll-free 1-844-348-4119 or email .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) with their name, contact information and location.\nA national, toll-free crisis line is available to provide support to those who needs it, 24 hours a day, at 1-844-413-6649.\nYou can also visit the inquiry\u2019s Inuktitut-language webpage here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(11) Comments:\n#1.\u00a0Posted by  Wonder? on May 24, 2017\n\nIs this MMIW INQUIRY really going to help anyone?\nI have very sad memories of dead loved ones and some of the local\nmeetings we have are pointless. Death is the end of life and that is\nthat.\nThe only people who benefit are the highly paid  experts or\nwhatever they call themselves.\n\n\n#2.\u00a0Posted by  Isumajuq on May 24, 2017\n\nIs anyone going to benefit from this? I know that people are grieving over lost loved ones, but what is the major outcome of this? Families will keep grieving- no matter what. Its a loss. Millions of public dollars being wasted on community visits to find out about lost ones? missing and murdered.. Whats the biggest outcome people will get out of this? how will it benefit us? lots of tax dollars going towards something like this?? when we cant do anything about it. What about the people who are still here on earth? We still matter don\u2019t we? if you want change.. we should be working towards something else.. like a Mamisarvik in our own territory. Sad.. always sad..\n\n\n#3.\u00a0Posted by  Bronson on May 24, 2017\n\nWell said#1 #2\u2019\nWe get so many EXPERTS in Nunavut who will tell people what to\ndo, but will not get up off their highly paid backsides to do their jobs!\n\n\n#4.\u00a0Posted by  Been There. on May 25, 2017\n\nWhat\u2019s going to change? The outcome of this will probably be the same as with the Suicide Conferences. Just another opportunity to tell their own personnel stories and go away with nothing except the reopening of old wounds. The pain may dull but never goes completely away. Well put 1 & 2.\n\n\n#5.\u00a0Posted by  Tax payer on May 25, 2017\n\nEveryone has different feelings and concerns about the MMIW Inquiry, It is nice to see that people would like to voice their feelings to show and hopefully allow others to do the same, I myself am glad to see MY tax paying dollars being put to this instead of a jail, healing facility or to more welfare recipients who do not do anything for our communities. way to go to all the families that do find the courage to speak.\n\n\n#6.\u00a0Posted by  Also Been There on May 25, 2017\n\n# 5, of course you have an opinion but so many people have seen\nmisuse and waste of money over the years it is no wonder that they\nhave become very sceptical.\nIn our community we have directors for Recreation, Economic Development, and Wellness coordination. When will they get their\nact together? They are always flying out to meetings. We see no\nbenefit to the community at all.\n\n\n#7.\u00a0Posted by  Tax payer on May 25, 2017\n\n#6, I cant answer for you why the directors in your community aren\u2019t utilizing the money the way you want it.. perhaps we can all do our part in this world to better ourselves with education considering its practically free and try to get into these positions with the GN/Hamlets. My 2 cents. Taima\n\n\n#8.\u00a0Posted by  Also been there on May 25, 2017\n\nI do like your comments TAX PAYER, but some of the workers here\nare so maddening.\nThey have their jobs for years and accomplish nothing.\nThe councils won\u2019t help.\n\n\n#9.\u00a0Posted by  Inuk Family Member on May 25, 2017\n\nWho are they to decide whether or not I am \u2018competent\u2019 enough to tell my family\u2019s story?\nMMIWI may want to reconsider making statements about any family member\u2019s ability to tell our own stories.\n \nIn one breath they speak of the importance of our real lived experience as Inuit and then turn around and question our fitness to speak for ourselves?? WTF??\nSomeone take the mic away from this woman so she can give her head a shake.\nWe need a supportive and non-judgmental environment supported by competent employees of the Inquiry, then you\u2019ll see people come forward.\nSo far, it doesn\u2019t feel safe. I just don\u2019t see Inuit reflected when I look in to decide if I\u2019m going to pull my soul up to the table and spill it out.\n\n\n#10.\u00a0Posted by  Inuk woman on May 26, 2017\n\nThis is great to hear that someone has put in an effort in speaking up. We need more trial blazers like this. I don\u2019t understand how this is looked as a \u201cbad\u201d thing based on some of these negative comments. Do you not realize that this may be a root cause of addictions & suicide too? This needs to be taken serious & not brushed under the carpet. This is real & especially real for the families. Maybe this will help in opening other oppurtunities in helping Nunavut communities- keep an open mind on this, not a closed one!\n\n\n#11.\u00a0Posted by  Talk Man on May 26, 2017\n\nLike a lot of people in Nunavut I have seen a lot of expensive inquiry\u2019s\nthat do not accomplish anything at all, apart from big wages and expenses to the advisors and experts.\nMyself and other people who have experienced tragedy meet quietly\nin a house and we talk about our loved ones who have passed on.\nWe all find it very beneficial, no one has complained.\nA few months ago some experts came to our meeting, and even\nstarted giving orders and instructions in their smiling faced fashion.\nWe told them to leave,and when they didn\u2019t,I called the RCMP.\nI encourage people in other communities to do the same,but it is up to\nthe people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Email:\n\n\n\nYour Name: \n\n\n Remember my personal information\n\n\nYour Location:\n\n\n\nYour comment: \n\n\n Notify me of follow-up comments?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEWS\nFEATURES\nEDITORIAL\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nTAISSUMANI\nCOMMENTARY\nNEWS TIPS\nPRIVACY POLICY\nCOMMENTING POLICY\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0THIS WEEK\u2019S ADS\n\n\nJOBS\nTENDERS\nNOTICES\n\n\n\u00a0ADVERTISING\n\n\nRATE CARD/MEDIA KIT\nEMAIL AD DEPARTMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 1995-2017 Nortext Publishing Corporation (Iqaluit) and may not be reprinted for commercial publication in print, or any other media, without the permission of the publisher. \n\n\nNunatsiaq News, PO Box 8, Iqaluit, NU X0A 0H0 \u2022 Ph.

This is not just a First Nations issue, this is a Canadian issue and we all have a role to play.\"\n In 2014 RCMP reported a total of 225 unsolved missing and murdered cases across all police jurisdictions in Canada.\u00a0 Current updated data shows 106 unsolved homicide cases and 98 unsolved missing cases (unknown or foul play suspected circumstances) remain outstanding.\u00a0 Other key findings include that the vast majority of victims of violence, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal alike, had a relationship with the offender.\u00a0 This is consistent with the 2014 report.\u00a0 \n \"The RCMP is taking some important steps to work with First Nations,\" said AFN Regional Chief Cameron Alexis who leads the policing portfolio for AFN.\u00a0\u00a0 \"All jurisdictions need to look at what they can do to ensure that Indigenous women and girls are safe and secure.\u00a0 We need a national inquiry to get to the root causes and find long-term solutions, and we need immediate action to ensure they're safe now.\u00a0 All municipal and accredited police services in this country including the military police need to work together on Aboriginal policing issues such as missing and murdered Aboriginal women.\u00a0 A National Aboriginal Policing Forum was advocated for but the\u00a0federal government did not respond in kind even though they continue to publicly state $25 million has been set aside.\u00a0 There is still no evidenced action!\u00a0 As an outgoing Regional Chief, the federal response was very disappointing for me while trying to serve our people.\"\n First Nations continue to press for adequate support for prevention and safety intiatiaves and a National Public Commission of Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous women. \n A national gathering on justice and policing (an outcome from the February 2015 National Roundtable on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls) is expected to be held in Winnipeg, Manitoba later this year as an opportunity to craft a detailed plan for coordination and change across a number of jurisdictions.\n The 2014 National Operational Overview was based on data from all police services from 1980-2012.\u00a0 The 2015 Update to the National Operation Overview is based on RCMP data from 2013-2014.\u00a0 \n The report is available at http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/pubs/abo-aut/mmaw-fada-eng.htm. \n The Assembly of First Nations is the national organization representing First Nation citizens in Canada.

The first day is a closed meeting for families of the missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. They will provide input into the content of a presentation and help develop recommendations that will taken to\u00a0a meeting of federal ministers, provincial and territorial premiers and Indigenous organizations on Friday.\nLong awaited discussion on violence against Indigenous women\u00a0and girls in Canada\nThe goals of the roundtable are\nInitiate dialogue among all levels of government to take action to effectively address the crisis of violence against Indigenous women and girls.\nCollectively identify solutions and means of moving\u00a0them forward\u00a0reduce and eventually eliminate all forms of violence.\nSecure further commitment to collaborative dialogue and engagement of Indigenous peoples in actions that involve all parties.\nUnderlying issues of poverty and discrimination must be included in any discussion about violence\u00a0\nAt the conclusion of the roundtable\u00a0a document will be produced that will outline the outcomes and next steps to be taken. For many of the attendees\u00a0the hope is that one of the next steps will be a national inquiry. Advocates of a national inquiry believe the issue of murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls cannot be addressed by criminal or judicial\u00a0measures alone. Leaders and communities must examine the underlying issues such as poverty and discrimination.\nStudy shows Canadian federal, provincial and territorial governments\u00a0ignored expert recommendations to prevent violence\nThe roundtable is taking place the same week as a study is being released showing that Canadian governments have repeatedly ignored expert recommendations that have been put forward to stop violence against Indigenous women and girls.\nThe Legal Strategy Coalition on Violence Against Indigenous Women reviewed 58 reports covering 20 years that dealt with aspects of violence and discrimination against Indigenous women and girls. The researchers found that tragically only a few of the over 700 recommendations have ever been put into action.\n\u201cA national inquiry is needed to examine why there has been so much resistance by successive governments to implementation of known and recommended measures to address the issue,\u201c stressed Women\u2019s Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF) director Kim Stanton.\nNUPGE\nThe National Union of Public and General Employees (NUPGE) is one of Canada's largest labour organizations with over 340,000 members. Our mission is to improve the lives of working families and to build a stronger Canada by ensuring our common wealth is used for the common good.\u00a0NUPGE\n\n\n\nIssues and Campaigns:\u00a0Women's Issues \nPrinter-friendly versionSend by email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatchlist\n\n\n\n All Together NOW!  \n \n\n Social Impact Bonds \n \n\n Right to Work Laws are All Wrong \n \n\n Tools to fight privatization \n \n\n Why Unions Matter contest \n \n\n\n\nIssues and Campaigns\nAll Together Now!Child careConvention 2013Equality and Human RightsInternational SolidarityLabour RightsMedicareNational Union Action on Retiree Concerns (NUARC)Pensions and Retirement SecurityPrivatizationRobin Hood TaxSocial Impact BondsTradeValue of Public ServicesWomen's Issues\n\nOccupational Groups\nCHPSCorrections/Criminal JusticeDirect governmentEarly Childhood EducationEducation and TrainingHealth CareLiquor Store WorkersProbation OfficersSocial ServicesTransportation\n\nPrograms and Partnerships\nCalendar of EventsNUPGE ComponentsPublicationsScholarshipsWeb links\n\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n National Union of Public and General Employees15 Auriga Drive, Nepean, ON K2E 1B7 613-228-9800 phone 613-228-9801 fax\n\nCopyright 1995-2015\u00a0NUPGEAll Rights Reserved\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They left with an unforgettable experience which will continue to raise awareness on the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women.\"\nAbout 250 turned out from Kincardine and surrounding area, with a total of $6,500 raised during the event, Wolfe said.\nThe delegates in attendance during the evening included MKO Grand Chief Sheila North Wilson, Chief Vernon Roote, Chief Gregory Nadjiwon, Dr. Dawn Harvard - President of the Native Women's Association of Canada.\n\"The volunteers that made the entire night a success, cannot be thanked enough,\" she said. \"It takes the hands of many to make an event spectacular.\"\n'My Story' by Jaylynn Wolfe (Age 8)\nI am 8 year old Jaylynn Wolfe and this is my story!\nWhen my mom told me about the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women crisis, I took a big breath.\nHow could this happen?\nWhy?\nI had a lot of questions.\nI asked my mom questions about why these Indigenous women were treated so badly?\nWhy were they murdered?\nWhy is no one looking for them?\nI asked my mom is this going to happen to me?\nI was scared!\nI started to cry!\nI wished I wasn't native!\nI wished I was a boy!\nNo one should be scared to be an Indigenous girl or women!\nPlease do not let his happen to me!\nMiigwech!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Businesses\n\n\n Contact us to Advertise \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAgriculture\n\n\nC& R Barn Removal\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBeauty & Spa\n\n\nbeauty within by grace\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tServices\n\n\nWagler's Storage Sheds\n\n\n\n\nGo to the Marketplace \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Businesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertise with us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContribute\n\n\nSend Your Scoop!\n\nShare your story, photo or video about something you've seen.\n Send your story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-Editions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHanover \n View, submit, participate!\n\n\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nAdvertise online\n\n\nAnnounce your business\n\n\nReach potential customers\n\n\n\n\nContribute\n\n Send us news, photos or videos\n\n Add an event to the calendar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow The Post\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\nLocal\nCanada\nWorld\n\n\nSports\nHigh School Sports\nHockey\nOther Sports\n\n\nEntertainment\nLocal\nMovies\nCelebrities\n\n\nOpinion\nEditorial\nLetters\nColumn\n\n\nUR\nEntertainment\nLife\nMoney\nNews\nOpinion\nSports\n\n\n\nLife\nMoney\nMarketplace\nNewsstand\nPhotos\nVideos\nEvents\nPolls\nWeather\nBecome A Carrier\n\n\n\n\n\n Reader services\n\nE-Edition\n\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nOnline\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nThe Post\n Feedback\n\n Letters to the editor\n\nPostmedia Publications\n\n\n\nServices\n\nAutos\nHomes\nClassifieds\nCareers\nObituaries\n\n\n\n\n\n Sitemap\n\nPrivacy\nTerms\n Research\n\n Contact-us\n\n\n\n\u00a9  2016 The Post.

The report was released at a news conference by Commissioner J.V.N. (Vince) Hawkes and Detective Superintendent Dave Truax of OPP Criminal Investigation Services who were accompanied by Ontario Regional Chief Isadore Day and Deputy Grand Chief Denise Stonefish of the Association of Iroquois and Allied Indians.\nBeginning in 2011, the OPP began proactively reviewing all available information on homicide investigations and unsolved missing persons and unidentified remains in OPP jurisdiction where the victim was identified or self-identified as Aboriginal. The report covers a period from 1956 to 2014.\n\"We recognize that there are many unanswered questions and that we cannot reverse the outcomes for the families and loved ones of those have gone missing or were murdered,\" said Hawkes. \"We hope information in the OPP report generates further discussion, potential leads, and/or resolution for the families and communities who have suffered loss.\"\nTo the end of 2014, there were 54 homicides involving Indigenous women. Police solved 85.2 per cent of those cases, leaving eight which remain unsolved. The police report states that of the 46 solved female Indigenous homicides, nine were murdered by a family member, 17 were murdered by a domestic partner or spouse, 19 were murdered by someone known to the victim and only one was of unknown circumstances.\nFor the period of 1978 to Dec. 2014, inclusive, there were 126 homicides of Indigenous males in OPP jurisdiction with only one case remaining unsolved. Of the 125 cases that were solved, 35 were murdered by family members, 10 were murdered by a domestic partner or spouse, 70 were murdered by someone known to the victim, nine were of unknown circumstances and one was not available.\nDuring the same period, there were eight missing Indigenous women reported to the OPP who remain missing. Police said they have reason to suspect foul play was involved in at least one of these occurrences. Presently, there are 39 cases that involve missing Indigenous men. Police believe foul play is possible or suspected in 22 of these cases with the other 17 simply considered as missing persons.\n\"The release of this report is timely to the start of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) National Inquiry and the release of the full report from the Truth and Reconciliation process. Now it's time to get work done based on a new social lens in Canada. Reconciliation means that all Canadians, all organizations, all political stripes and authorities, roll up their sleeves and begin to change a Nation. The Ontario Provincial Police report on missing and murdered First Nation citizens gives us a good starting point,\" Day said.\nThe OPP Report on Missing And Unsolved Murdered Indigenous People In OPP Jurisdiction is currently available in English via the OPP website (www.opp.ca/mumip) and will be translated in French, the five recognized Aboriginal languages in Ontario -- Cree, Oji-Cree, Ojibway, Oneida, and Mohawk -- and in Algonquin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Businesses\n\n\n Contact us to Advertise \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTourism\n\n\nKingston 1000 Islands Cruises\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tContractors\n\n\nWaito Homes\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRetail\n\n\nBright Eyes & Bushy Tails\n\n\n\n\nGo to the Marketplace \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Businesses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertise with us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContribute\n\n\nSend Your Scoop!\n\nShare your story, photo or video about something you've seen.\n Send your story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscription\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart your day with Pembroke Daily Observer\nChoose among a variety of subscription packages and stay up to date with convenient home delivery and our on the go digital e-edition.\n View my options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-Editions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPembroke\n View, submit, participate!\n\n\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nAdvertise online\n\n\nAnnounce your business\n\n\nReach potential customers\n\n\n\n\nContribute\n\n Send us news, photos or videos\n\n Add an event to the calendar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Pembroke Daily Observer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\nLocal\nProvincial\nCanada\nWorld\n\n\nSports\nHigh School Sports\nHockey\nOther Sports\nPlayoff Pool\n\n\nEntertainment\nLocal\nMovies\nMusic\nTelevision\nBooks\nVideo Games\nCelebrities\n\n\nLife\nHealth\nFood\nTravel\n\n\nOpinion\nEditorial\nLetters\nColumn\n\n\nUR\nEntertainment\nLife\nMoney\nNews\nOpinion\nSports\n\n\n\nMoney\nMarketplace\nPhotos\nVideos\nEvents\nPolls\nWeather\nPlayoff Pool\n\n\n\n\n\n Subscribe\n\n Print\n\nE-Edition\n\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nOnline\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nPembroke Daily Observer\n Feedback\n\n Letters to the editor\n\nPostmedia Publications\n Where to buy\n\n\n\n\nServices\n\nAutos\nHomes\nClassifieds\nCareers\nObituaries\n\n\n\n\n\n Sitemap\n\nPrivacy\nTerms\n Research\n\n Contact-us\n\n\n\n\u00a9  2016 Pembroke Daily Observer.

We want to come back full circle.\"\n\n\t\t    Photograph By\n\t\t    \t\t      Michael Potestio/KTW\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The chief commissioner of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) said governments and private-sector organizations can now begin strategizing how to address the report\u2019s 231 recommendations.\n Marion Buller was at Thompson Rivers University on Monday, speaking to a packed crowd in the Brown Family House of Learning about the report, which cited the significant, persistent and deliberate pattern of systemic human rights and Indigenous-rights violations and abuses as the cause of the disappearances, murders and violence experienced by Indigenous women and girls.\n\n\n\n  article continues below\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending Stories\n\nKamloops\u2019 stairway to headaches?\nKamloops student gets $85,000 scholarship to Oklahoma university\nNicolani Drive\u2019s little library thrives\nKamloops RCMP seeks driver of vehicle involved in suspicious incident near school\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The report said the violence constituted genocide by the state against Indigenous people.\n Buller described the report\u2019s recommendations as \u201clegal imperatives\u201d rather than mere recommendations, given Canada\u2019s commitment to international declarations and treaties recognizing Indigenous, human and civil rights.\n\n She said the inquiry found \u201cbreach upon breach,\u201d arguing the federal government cannot continue to promote an image of Canada upholding those rights while that not being the case domestically.\n The report calls on all forms of government to ensure those rights are recognized and protected. That includes Indigenous governments, which Buller said were found to not have the full trust of Indigenous women to represent their interests.\n The recommendations also extended to facets of society such as the media, hospitality and transportation industries and education and legal systems.\u00a0\n Buller told KTW both the public and private sectors should read the report and start to strategize how they can address its recommendations. She said the cities of Saskatoon and Winnipeg are already doing this and noted Kamloops can do the same.\n \u201cI suggest the mayor here call the mayors of Winnipeg and Saskatoon and find out precisely what they\u2019re doing,\u201d she said.\n Buller also suggested the Tk\u2019emlups te Secwepemc First Nation also read the report and develop priorities, strategies and partnerships needed in order to move forward.\n Provinces and territories could begin to work on education, child care and the justice system independent of the federal government, given their jurisdictions in these areas, she said.\n \u201cProvincial and territorial governments, you have no excuse for not moving forward,\u201d Buller said during her presentation.\n Taking questions from the crowd, Buller was asked how a national action plan can be implemented when baseline data is incomplete and a federal election is on the horizon.\n She said such a plan won\u2019t be easy, but added it will need to be implemented through a partnership with Indigenous peoples at all levels of government.\n \u201cNot by government doing to us, yet again, but us doing it with government,\u201d Buller said.\n The inquiry heard from 1,434 family members and survivors of violence, gathered testimony from 83 experts and knowledge keepers and held 15 community hearings and more than 50 statement-gathering events across Canada, Buller said, noting a research team also analyzed more than 900 studies for the report.\n She pointed to a number of disturbing trends that stood out to her over the course of compiling the report.\n One was that women didn\u2019t feel safe in their own communities or homes, particularly in Northern Canada.\n \u201cThere are no safe houses. There may be only one road out and that is an ice road,\u201d Buller said. \u201cSo many women do not have a choice that women in urban centres have.\u201d\n Buller also heard that violence was a normal part of women\u2019s lives \u2014 a normalized occurrence passed down from multiple generations stemming from the residential school system.\n Disillusionment with police was also a common theme, Buller said, noting she also heard numerous stories in which police officers went \u201cabove and beyond the call of duty to keep women safe, but those stories were few and far between.\u201d\n Too often, Buller said, she heard women say they had no choice but to sell their bodies to feed their children. Buller also heard from women who said they were trafficked.\n \u201cI am appalled at the amount of human trafficking that\u2019s taking place in Canada,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a judge, I thought I knew everything. I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n Some of the recommendations Buller noted from the report include the need for better resourced First Nations police services, health care to be treated a human right, the need for mobile services and the importance of Indigenous languages being made official languages.\n Safe and affordable transportation services to combat trafficking, greater context when educating students about first contact, expanding legal aid and changing the definition of some offences that imply consent on the part of the victim were other recommendations she noted in her presentation.\n While addressing the use of the word \u201cgenocide\u201d in the report, which sparked debate over whether it was an accurate term, Buller told KTW she thinks people are now turning their attention to the actual content of the report.\n \u201cGenocide is only one of millions of words in our final report,\u201d she said.\n Looking ahead, Buller said there are many people \u201cwho aren\u2019t going to let this issue or this report gather dust all across Canada and internationally.\u201d\n The mandate of the report was to inquire and report on systemic underlying and historical causes of violence against Indigenous women, girls and LGBTQ people and make recommendations to stop that violence.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s happened through the process of colonization is that Indigenous women have lost their power and lost their place in their own societies, \u201c Buller said. \u201cWe want to come back full circle.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9  Kamloops This Week\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail this article to a Friend\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Email Address: *\n\nYour Name: *\n\nTo Email Address: *\n\n* Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.\n\n\nMessage: *\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2039\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nprevious\nKamloops Library has a Eureka moment\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nnext\nConservative Leader Scheer to visit Kamloops on July 2\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u203a\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprev\n\n\n\nKamloops Library has a Eureka moment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConservative Leader Scheer to visit Kamloops on July 2\n\n\nnext\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n\n\nKTW Daily News Alerts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the latest news right in your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n KAMLOOPS WEATHER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion of the Week POLL\nThe provincial government wants  your opinion on time changes.

A 33-year-old man was charged with second-degree murder and offering an indignity to human remains in November 2015. \n\n\nA long-standing call for an inquiry into the disproportionate number of missing and murdered indigenous women across the country was answered Wednesday, and families personally affected by these tragedies in Saskatchewan are reacting.\nFive commissioners who will study the issue were announced at a ceremony in Ottawa, including Marilyn Poitras, a professor at the University of Saskatchewan, with a focus on indigenous law.\nTo date, the only formal figures available are from the RCMP.\nIn May 2014, it documented 1,181 cases of murdered and missing women between 1980 and 2012.\nA year later, it released updated figures, noting 32 more aboriginal women had been murdered and 11 more had disappeared since its initial report.\nPauline Okemow lost her youngest sister, Marsha, in Prince Albert in 1989. The 16-year-old was stabbed nine times by another aboriginal woman at a party.\n\"It's like going to a big mall, see your child go running and never see them again -- you feel that helpless,\" Okemow said at a Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations event in Saskatoon.\nShe said she is thankful there is finally going to be a voice for these women.\nCarol Wolfe's daughter was missing for five and a half years before her remains were found near Saskatoon's airport in November 2015.\n\"We had walks, we had meetings, we discussed, we looked so often,\" Wolfe said through an interpreter.\nMajor crimes arrested a 33-year-old man in connection to Wolfe's disappearance and murder in November 2015.\nFSIN Vice Chief Heather Bear also spoke at the event.\n\"I'm very emotional today because it's been a long time. There are so many vulnerable Indigenous women and girls that have faced these heinous crimes.\"\nSaskatoon Police ready to assist if called upon\nSaskatoon Police Chief Clive Weighill is prepared to handle the criticism police forces across the country will face during the two-year inquiry.\nWeighill said they haven't been told yet how police will be involved in the upcoming probe, but any requests, including the reopening of historical cases, will have the full cooperation of his force.\n\"I can assure the indigenous population that the police will cooperate with all facets of the inquiry. And if a particular event requires review or clarification we'll assist the commissioners and the family involved,\" Weighill said.\nWeighill said he hopes the inquiry will make a difference, but he cautioned the probe itself is not a solution. He said he feels the focus needs to be on examining the root causes of why these women and girls are the targets of violence.\n\"In my opinion, if we don't solve the issues of poverty, poor housing, disadvantage we're still going to continue to have women violently assaulted, murdered or missing.\"\n\"Government's of all levels have to really take a closer look at how we're dealing with poverty situations in Canada.\"\nWeighill said Indigenous people are victimized five to six times more than the rest of society, adding the issues in Saskatoon are generally the same in communities across Western Canada.\nOne of the 11 historical missing person case files being investigated by Saskatoon police involves an indigenous female.\n-With files from The Canadian Press\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n Email news@ckom.com \n Twitter @CKOMNews  \n\n\nShare Twitter\nFacebook\nGoogle+\nReddit\nForward\n \nTopics:\u00a0\nProvincial\n\n\nJoin the Discussion\nNews Talk 650 CKOM is happy to provide a forum for commenting and discussion.

Paulson\u2019s letter backed Aboriginal Affairs Minister Bernard Valcourt who faced a backlash after he mentioned the 70 per cent statistic during a closed-door meeting in Calgary with several chiefs, including Martial, at the end of March.\nIn his own letter to Paulson, Bellegarde said the RCMP should have initially shared the information with First Nations.\n\u00a0\nDownload (PDF, 100KB)\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that the RCMP and the federal government did not inform First Nations leadership of this information,\u201d said Bellegarde, in the letter. \u201cThere is a long history of mistrust of police by First Nations and citizens. Withholding information only serves to damage relationships and foster suspicion, especially when that information is shared with government agencies or representatives who seem willing to use that information against First Nations to deny or diminish the action required.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Bellegarde also calls on the RCMP and the Harper government to release all \u201crelevant\u201d information related to murdered and missing Indigenous women to First Nations and the AFN. He then requests a meeting with Paulson \u201cat the earliest opportunity.\u201d\nPart of the information the RCMP holds on murdered and missing Indigenous women comes from about 300 police forces and Statistics Canada. The RCMP signed agreements with Statistics Canada and the police agencies allowing it to obtain the information under certain conditions, including not disclosing the raw data publicly without the consent of the other parties.\nPaulson also broke the RCMP\u2019s \u201cbias-free policing policy\u201d when he confirmed the 70 per cent statistic. The RCMP initially said it would not be releasing ethnically-based information on perpetrators. Paulson confirmed the statistics as Valcourt faced increased criticism and calls for his resignation following his meeting in Calgary when he first mentioned the 70 per cent number.\n\u00a0Valcourt has previously publicly stated First Nation men were responsible for the majority of violence against First Nations women.\n\nThe RCMP released its first report on murdered and missing Indigenous women last spring, but it did not provide any data on the ethnicity of perpetrators. The RCMP is expected to release a second report on the subject in May.\nAn RCMP spokesperson said Paulson would be responding to Bellegarde\u2019s letter.\nNews@aptn.ca\n@APTNNews\n\n\n\nTags: Aboriginal Affairs Minister Bernard Valcourt, AFN National Chief Perry Bellegarde, Alberta, Murdered and Missing Indigenous women, Ottawa, RCMP, RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson, Treaty 6 Grand Chief Bernice Martial\n\n\n\nAPTN National News\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tView all posts by APTN National News \u2192 \n\n\n\n\nFirst Nations lead Quebec City march on climate action\nCN takes action against Grassy Narrows over blockade that didn\u2019t happen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch for:\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Posts\nForest fire on edge of Saskatchewan town: \u2018The fire is in the airport and is moving\u2019 0 comments\nFormer Native Women\u2019s Association president living in a tent outside Edmonton 0 comments\nVideo allegedly shows Quebec cops beating Innu man 0 comments\n\u2018Girl in the shadows\u2019 rescues shirtless and shoeless CFS runaway in Winnipeg 0 comments\n\u2018We\u2019re in need of help!\u2019 Elder pleads for La Ronge fire evacuees 0 comments\nWoman boycotting Toronto convenience store for refusing status card 2 comments\nPlan to direct-deposit government cheques rolled back 0 comments\nNot everyone will be celebrating Canada Day 0 comments\nMusic duo raise cash to shoot cross-Canada video for murdered and missing Indigenous women song 0 comments\nSaskatchewan fire information as of July 7 0 comments\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\t\t@APTNNews on Twitter\n\t\t \n\n\nTweets by @APTNNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlanket of smoke from BC fires cause health concerns in Vancouver\n\n\n\n29 mins ago\n\n\nNational News \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMontreal Lake Chief says province gave community false sense of security about wildfires\n\n\n\n33 mins ago\n\n\nNational News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n11 year old Alexis Siebrecht back at home after liver transplant, looking forward to the future\n\n\n\n38 mins ago\n\n\nNational News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018We\u2019re in need of help!\u2019 Elder pleads for La Ronge fire evacuees\n\n\n\n22 hours ago\n\n\nNational News \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPages \nAbout APTN InFocus\nAbout APTN Investigates\nAbout APTN National News\nAbout Face to Face\nAbout Nation to Nation\nAbout The Laughing Drum\nAPTN Investigates Full Episodes\nLive Stream\nNewscasts\nSend Your Comments\n\n \n\n Recent Stories \n\nBlanket of smoke from BC fires cause health concerns in Vancouver\n\n\nMontreal Lake Chief says province gave community false sense of security about wildfires\n\n\n11 year old Alexis Siebrecht back at home after liver transplant, looking forward to the future\n\n\n\u2018We\u2019re in need of help!\u2019 Elder pleads for La Ronge fire evacuees\n\n\nAllexis Siebrecht returns home after successful liver transplant\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t \u00a9 2015.

Their stories about their mothers, daughters, aunties and cousins who had tragically gone missing or were murdered were heartwrenching ... It's because of these courageous women and families who knew something was very wrong that we are here today.\" \u2014 Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett.\n\t\t\t ___\n\t\t\t\n\"The big houses behind me ... represent the strength and resilience of the human spirit, the strength of indigenous peoples and it is that strength, the culture, the traditions and our languages that are going to assist in healing, that are going to chart a new path to the future where indigenous peoples can finally see their face in the mirror of our Constitution.\" \u2014 Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould.\n\t\t\t ___\n\t\t\t \"Canada's colonial history altered indigenous communities and families and the racism brought on by colonization has had devastating impacts on indigenous women's power, their status, their role in their communities and their economic situations. This intersection of racism and sexism greatly increases the vulnerability of indigenous women and girls to experience violence. Changing these attitudes and practices will require a steady and an honest gaze.\" \u2014 Status of Women Minister Patricia Hajdu.\n\t\t\t ___\n\t\t\t \"The spirits of the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls will be close in our hearts and in our minds as we do our work. The families and the survivors' losses, pain, strength and courage will inspire our work.\" \u2014 chief commissioner Marion Buller.\n\t\t\t ___\n\t\t\t \"We have arrived at a new beginning: an inquiry that we hope will help us end the violence that indigenous women and girls face every day of their lives.\" \u2014 Dawn Lavell-Harvard, president of the Native Women's Association of Canada.\n\t\t\t ___\n\t\t\t \"There's racism, there's discrimination, there's misogyny, there's genocide, there's colonization, there's oppression and there's also exploitation of women and that has to stop. Because the simple message to everyone is this: indigenous lives matter. Indigenous women and girls, their lives are important. Their lives matter and they're not any less than anybody else.\" \u2014 National Chief Perry Bellegarde, Assembly of First Nations.\n\t\t\t ___\n\t\t\t \"It is high time that the embarrassment and shame that we carry gets addressed through this inquiry.\" \u2014 Melanie Omeniho, president of Women of the Metis Nation.\n\t\t\t ___\n\t\t\t \"For this inquiry to be meaningful to Inuit, it must be led by indigenous women, including an Inuk woman. This is to me a fundamental matter of principle, equality and trust.\" \u2014 Rebecca Kudloo, president of Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada.\n\t\t\t ___\n\t\t\t \n  \n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\nE\u2013mail\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Error\n\n\n\n\nRate this \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article has not yet been rated.\n\n\nWe want you to tell us what you think of our articles.

Countless others who followed a similar trajectory are no longer alive to tell the tale.\nSharon Acoose sits for a photograph at her office at the First Nations University of Canada in Saskatoon on Nov. 15, 2016.To this day, that same cycle is repeating itself with alarming frequency in indigenous communities across Canada, a CP investigation has found.Poised to be a major party of inquiry\n\nAnd with its insidious links to suicide, violence and mental health problems, the issue of child sexual abuse is poised to be a key theme in next year's long-anticipated national inquiry into the tragic phenomenon of murdered and missing indigenous women.Acoose was just three years old and living in Regina when it started \u2014 three separate uncles, all of them now dead. The memory later manifested as emotional, spiritual and physical self-punishment, fuelled by the cocktail of drugs and alcohol she used to numb her pain.\"That was just my destiny,'' she said. \"That's exactly why I became what I became, because I grew up bitter, against men.''\n\"That's exactly why I became what I became.\"Indeed, experiences of sexual and physical abuse among indigenous women and girls are so pervasive they are expected to overwhelm next year's national inquiry, where commissioners will examine and report on the systemic causes of the violence.Hearings are expected to begin in early 2017 and will undoubtedly draw attention from around the globe, said chief commissioner Marion Buller.'Unmistakable connection' to domestic violence\n\nIn May 2014, the RCMP documented 1,181 murdered and missing women between 1980 and 2012. A year later, it said 32 additional aboriginal women had been murdered and 11 more had disappeared since it first reported on the issue.The force also cited an \"unmistakable connection'' between homicide and family violence.Aboriginal women are vulnerable precisely because they're aboriginal and women, said Dr. Yvonne Boyer, a Canada Research Chair at Manitoba's Brandon University.\n\"I see it as all being on a continuum.\"Boyer co-authored a report on trafficking of aboriginal women for the Public Safety Department in May 2014 that noted many of its participants suffered sexual abuse as a child, contributing to a pattern of exploitation that carried on into their adult years.\"I see it as all being on a continuum,'' she said in an interview.\"You have children who are abused, you have young teenagers that are abused, they go through life, then it is just normalized behaviour ... some of them, we just don't hear their voices anymore because they're gone.''The links between missing and murdered women and childhood sexual abuse is undeniable, added Wally Oppal, who led B.C.'s hearings on how authorities handled cases in the wake of the Robert Pickton investigation.\nA photo of Sarah DeVries is pinned on a bulletin board in Pat DeVries' kitchen. Sarah was murdered in Vancouver and her DNA was found at the Port Coquitlam farm of serial killer Robert Pickton.Pickton \u2014 one of Canada's most notorious serial killers \u2014 was convicted in 2007 of the murders of six women and charged in the deaths of 20 others. A number of them were aboriginal.Oppal's report found aboriginal women experience higher levels of violence in terms of both incidence and severity and are disproportionately represented among the missing and murdered.\"I still think of those women and what had happened to them ... the abuses that had taken place and why they had left home,'' he said.\nCommissioner Wally Oppal pauses for a moment as he delivers the final report on the findings of the Missing Women Commission in Vancouver on Dec. 17, 2012. Indigenous women who have been incarcerated like Acoose commonly suffer from abuse and share similar vulnerable backgrounds with those who go murdered and missing, said Kim Pate \u2014 longtime head of the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies and one of Canada's newest senators.While The Canadian Press has a policy of not identifying the victims of sexual assault, Acoose agreed to be identified in this story as part of her ongoing efforts to raise awareness about the issue.\n\"I should have been dead by the time I was 20.''In her work at the First Nations University of Canada's Saskatoon campus, she finds herself pondering a lingering question: why wasn't there a national public inquiry 20 years ago?\"I am so fortunate to be able to talk to people and tell my story,'' Acoose said. \"I should have been dead by the time I was 20.''\u2014 Follow @kkirkup on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\ue007\n\n\n\t\t\t\t   REDress Project For Missing, Murdered Indigenous Women\t\t\t\t  \n\n\n\n\nof\n\n\n\ue000\n\n\n\ue001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Oct. 4, 2015, Canadians gathered to mark MMIW National Day of Remembrance by hanging red dresses outside their home, or wearing one as they went about their day. \n\nHere are some of the REDress project's most striking photos:\n\n\n\n\"Red Dress Project, Nunavut. #mmiw #redress #redressNU.

Its terms of reference include a mandate to to speak with communities and families affected by violence against Indigenous women and to recommend actions to remove systematic causes. \nBut at a joint media conference in Vancouver\u2019s Gastown neighbourhood, a coalition of advocates and family members said the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference should include an explicit mandate to review the police response to crimes against Indigenous women. \n\u201cOur justice system needs to change,\u201d said Lorelei Williams, who shared stories of violence and murder perpetrated against the women in her family, some of it mere blocks away in the nearby Downtown Eastside.\n\n\n\n\nIt was in that neighbourhood that serial killer Robert Pickton preyed upon marginalized women for more than a decade, many of them Indigenous.\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0Tyee\u00a0is\u00a0supported by\u00a0readers\u00a0like\u00a0you\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin us and grow independent\u00a0media in\u00a0Canada\n\n\n Pickton was convicted in 2007 of murdering six women, but told an undercover officer in a jail cell he\u2019d killed nearly 50.\n\u2018The violence is still happening with our women\u2019\nFor Williams, who now works with at-risk women in the Downtown Eastside, the need to include police actions in the inquiry\u2019s mandate is deeply personal.\nWilliams\u2019 aunt Belinda has been missing since 1978 and her cousin Tanya was last seen in 1996. Her DNA was later found on Pickton\u2019s farm in suburban Port Coquitlam. \nAnother family member escaped after being raped by a suspected serial killer, and yet another was shoved out of a window, again in the Downtown Eastside, Williams told reporters.\nWhen her cousin Tanya\u2019s disappearance was reported to the Vancouver Police Department 20 years ago the file was closed within a month, and her aunt Belinda\u2019s disappearance wasn\u2019t \u201ctechnically\u201d accepted by police until 2004, Williams said \u2014 issues that she attributes to racism.\nSince that time the VPD has made positive changes, but problems and attitudes rooted in racism and colonialism still result in police across Canada failing to protect Indigenous women, Williams said.\n\u201cYou can hear families saying the same things over and over again,\u201d she said. \u201cPolice are racist, judgmental, that\u2019s what flawed the cases\u2026 The violence is still happening with our women.\u201d \nShe said that police indifference and investigation and structural issues in the justice system also play a role. \nWilliams pointed to recent allegations that Quebec police abused Indigenous women and stories from a previous B.C. inquiry of women being violently thrown in the back of police wagons as further proof that police actions need to be specifically included in the inquiry\u2019s terms of reference. \nSeparate police inquiry needed: prof\nAnnie Ross, associate professor of First Nations Studies at Simon Fraser University, said a separate inquiry into the way police deal with violence against Indigenous women should be considered -- partly because of how many cases she alleges were never fully investigated. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s quite a lot with outstanding cases that need to be investigated properly for the first time,\u201d Ross said. \u201cLet\u2019s investigate them.\u201d \nRoss said problems seem to occur within specific departments and even at specific times, raising questions about how much the attitudes of individual officers toward Indigenous communities play a role in police failures. \nWhen a call to police is made, some departments can be dismissive if they know it\u2019s an Indigenous person on the line, she said. \n\u201cHow do dispatchers just know not to take cases?\u201d she said. \u201cDo they do that to everyone or just exclusively to Aboriginal women?\u201d \nThe Vancouver police were accused for years of ignoring the women who disappeared from the desperate alleys and streets where Canada\u2019s most marginalized people often end up. \nFormer B.C. attorney general Wally Oppal lead an inquiry in 2010 into the actions of the police during the Pickton years. He found the police failed to protect women, but the inquiry was slammed by advocates as \u201cdeeply flawed.\u201d \nA better experience\nAnother family member at the press conference, Gertie Pierre, had kinder words for police actions.\nPierre\u2019s niece Cheryl Ann Joe was brutally murdered in 1992 by Brian Allender in Vancouver, and Pierre said she was satisfied with the response of the VPD.\nPolice let her family know what was happening at every step of the investigation and never left them \u201cin the dark,\u201d Pierre said. \n\u201cWe did an honouring ceremony at the friendship centre to honour everyone that was involved with putting this man away,\u201d she said.\nPierre said she doesn\u2019t know why her experience differs from those of others across the country. She feels for the many family members still hoping the killers of their loved ones will be brought to justice, she said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Stolen Sisters' Invites National Reckoning on Missing Women\nread more \n\n\n\n\nIn Ottawa on Wednesday, Carolyn Bennett, Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs, told reporters the inquiry\u2019s scope allows the role of police to be examined. \n\u201cThe Terms of Reference direct the Commissioners first, to explore systemic and underlying causes of violence,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cSecond, to examine institutional policies and practices designed to address violence against Indigenous women and girls.\u201d\nBut Williams said she isn\u2019t ready to trust that the government will get to the root of the missing and murdered women and girls in Canada, nor does she believe it will fix the problems. \nFixing them starts with ensuring the police will be put under the magnifying glass along with others, she said, and having that commitment in the inquiry\u2019s mandate. \n\u201cThe terms of reference has to explicitly include policing and police accountability,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is very important to me because of what happened to my family.\u201d \n Read more: Aboriginal Affairs, Federal Politics  \n\n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Share on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Share on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Forward by Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nShare article via email\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend this article to:\n\n\n\nYour email address:\n\n\n\nYour message:\n\n\n\nWould you like to receive The Tyee's headlines free by email?\n\n\n\nYes, every day.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, once a week.\n\n\n\n\n\nI already subscribe.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, thanks.\n\n\n\n\nSubmit\n\nShow form again \u00bb\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0Tyee\u00a0is\u00a0supported by\u00a0readers\u00a0like\u00a0you\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin us and grow independent\u00a0media in\u00a0Canada\n\n\n\nGet The Tyee in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily\nWeekly\nNational (weekly)\n\n\n\nSubscribe now\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily\nWeekly\nNational (weekly)\n\nSubscribe now\nPrivacy policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nYour privacy is important to us.\n\n\nWhen subscribing to a newsletter edition you'll also get early notice on Tyee events, news, promotions, partner messages and special initiatives.\nFurther to the provision of the Personal Information Protection Act, personal information is kept confidential by TheTyee.ca and will not be sold, traded, released, shared or distributed to any other individuals, organizations or agencies without prior consent or notification.\nMeasures have been enacted to ensure the integrity of personal information and to protect it from misuse, loss or alteration.

After two and a half years of hearings, a Canadian inquiry released its final report on the disappearance and death of hundreds if not thousands of indigenous women, victims of endemic violence that the commission controversially said amounted to \"genocide.\"(Photo:\u00a0Andrew Meade/AFP/Getty Images)Canada's $92 million National Inquiry Into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls  was released on June 3rd. In announcing the report, Chief Commissioner Marion Buller\u00a0declared that the damage being done to Native women represents a \"deliberate race, identity, and gender-based genocide.\"When asked about the report by APTN reporter Tina House, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, \"We accept the findings of the commissioners that it was genocide, but our focus is going to be, as it must be, on the families, on the communities that have suffered such loss, on the systems that have repeatedly failed indigenous women and girls across this country.\"ADVERTISEMENTThanks for watching!Visit WebsiteTrudeau's statement seemed marked by reluctance, so House reiterated her question by drawing   on the testimony from affected families: \"Yesterday, many of the families that we spoke with said it was important for them to hear the acknowledgement coming from you,\" she said. \"Is that a yes or no? Do you believe it was genocide?\"Trudeau responded, \"I have acknowledged that I accept the findings of the report and the issue that we have is that people are getting wrapped up in debates over a very important and powerful term, and our focus\u2014as I've said\u2014we accept those findings, we accept the finding that this was genocide. We will move forward to end this ongoing national tragedy.\"ADVERTISEMENTThanks for watching!Visit WebsiteADVERTISEMENTThanks for watching!Visit WebsiteI'm tired of administrative and professionally emotionless responses to things like the murder and rape and disappearance of our women. Indigenous women I know weren't surprised to hear the word \"genocide\" surface in the national report. My auntie has always said there's a direct correlation between violence against the Earth and the violence against our women. The narrative that we were, or remain, \"squaws\" continues to cause real damage. Policies like Indian boarding schools, residential schools, and the Indian Removal Act\u00a0in the United States and the\u00a0Indian Act\u00a0in Canada have ravaged indigenous people across North America, and the aftereffects continue to affect our daily lives.White Canadian men on Twitter have begun disagreeing with the inquiry's findings. The writer Jon Kay objected to the term being used, arguing that, if these disappearances really qualified as genocide, then we would logically have to describe indigenous men as genocidaires, since\u2014in Kay's account\u2014they perpetrated most of the killings.Of course, if Kay had read the full report, he would have noticed the line that reads: \"The often-cited statistic that indigenous men are responsible for 70\u00a0percent of murders of indigenous women and girls is not factually based.\" The report further states: \"In our view, the [Royal Canadian Mounted Police's] reliance on such a small number of cases creates an unreliable basis upon which to focus policy. A focus on spousal violence, on the basis of flawed statistics, has resulted in an erroneously narrow focus on indigenous men as the perpetrators of violence against indigenous women and girls, and neglects other significant patterns in relation to missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada.\" You can lead white people to water and they'll colonize it, another of my aunties says.We understand very clearly that our own men are hurting us. In May, a student at my alma mater, the Institute of American Indian Arts, alleged she'd been sexually violated by an employee, an indigenous man with whom I graduated in 2016. The account was horrific, and the response was administrative, as it usually is. The president of IAIA offered a bloodless statement, saying that the school had reported the allegation to the sheriff's office and would conduct an investigation of its own. The president added: \"This is a reminder to all members of the IAIA community that IAIA takes all claims and complaints of sexual harassment and sexual violence seriously.\"Students at IAIA, on the other hand, produced a video, titled \"Stop the Silence IAIA!!\" where several students told the camera, \"I do not feel safe here.\"It was good to see students defending themselves and speaking out, but I worry when it's only the students and Native women in a community speaking with passion about fixing the crisis, while the administration is busy administrating and \"taking things seriously.\"Who even knows what \"taking things seriously\" means? I've never seen that statement used in a meaningful way that pointed toward a solution. It's something principals say about a bullying problem, where they don't want to be liable for an assault but can't condemn the bully either, because of a separate liability issue. As indigenous women, we know that our own men can be  culprits too, but the systems that administrate\u2014that willfully ignore or mishandle our testimony\u2014are in place because of colonization. Every pain in our side, and against our bodies, has some direct relationship to a power beyond us, inflicted on us; we are treated as though we are sub-human, even by our own governments and institutions.In inquiries of this sort, there is a constant refrain, almost as you'd find in a poem, usually made up of variations on the phrase \"lack of.\" It comes up several dozens of times in the report on murdered and missing indigenous women. In passages of the text concerning our women and 2SLGBTQQIA (two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, and asexual) community members, the commission reports that there is a \"lack of services,\" a \"lack of trust in the service providers,\" a \"lack of financial resources,\" a \"lack of implementation\" over consultation, a \"lack of indigenous interpreters,\" a \"lack of safety and care in the family home\" leading to youth running away, and a \"lack of support for youth aging out of care.\" And our \"lack of\" goes on. And on.I feel this general \"lack of\" today. I am tired, pushing through the inquiry, reading page after page, and listening to the cold administrative responses about our lived physical and emotional pain as indigenous women trying to survive a genocide. I feel the lack in my daily life, when I think about the death of Shawnee Inyallie, a woman who lived near my community, whose cousins are my friends. Shawnee went missing last year and was found in the Delta River; authorities labeled her death \"not suspicious.\" We see posters for missing women every day, and deaths are labeled \"not suspicious\" so often, it's hard to be hopeful that anything will change.With the release of this report, I hope that people who are not aware of our circumstances will read it with an open heart, and pay attention to the recommendations and testimony it contains, understanding that sometimes genocide looks like a slow burn from the outside, but inside, here with me, it looks like a wildfire that was already there when I was just a little girl, and women were disappearing and being labeled sex workers simply because they were Indian. It looked like my friends in sharing circles in elementary school, where we were asked by a teacher if we'd ever experienced inappropriate sexual behavior, and each of us had a story. It looks like knowing if you went in as a teen for birth control, you could be sterilized, and it sounds like a horror movie, right? That's why I never sought birth control; I was scared.It hurts to look at. But then imagine that you have no choice. That's how it feels.Pacific Standard's Ideas section is your destination for idea-driven features, voracious culture coverage, sharp opinion, and enlightening conversation.

Indigenous organizations have been calling for an inquiry: Groups, including the Native Women's Association of Canada and the Assembly of First Nations, have for years urged the federal government to open a national public inquiry into the phenomenon of missing and murdered indigenous women. They will closely examine the terms of reference and the commissioners selected. There are five people expected to sit on the body.\n\t\t\t\nIn May 2014, the RCMP released a report documenting 1,181 murdered and missing women between 1980 and 2012. A year later, it said 32 aboriginal women had been murdered and 11 more disappeared since it first reported on the issue.\n\t\t\t 2. The Liberal government plans to be flexible on timeline and funding: The federal government has banked on spending $40 million over the next two years on the inquiry but some observers already wonder if this will be enough money and time for the commissioners to do their work. Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett has noted this is a \"placeholder\" budget and she has consistently stressed the need to get the inquiry right.\n\t\t\t 3. The previous government did not support an inquiry: Former prime minister Stephen Harper opposed a formal examination of the issue of murdered and missing indigenous women. He noted there were already a number of studies on the record and stressed the need for action.\n\t\t\t 4. The commission will be able to compel witnesses to testify: Under the Inquiries Act, the commissioners will have the same powers as any court in a civil case to enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give evidence. They may also examine all papers, documents, vouchers, records and books belonging a public office or institution.\n\t\t\t 5. Child welfare is expected to be a central theme of the study: Bennett says child welfare will be a key issue. She said the government has repeatedly heard about the \"devastating\" impact on children who are apprehended and what often happens to their mothers.\n\t\t\t The government is currently engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal over federal funding for child welfare services on reserve.\n\t\t\t In January, the tribunal ruled the federal government discriminated against First Nations children in its funding of child welfare services.\n\t\t\t \n  \n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\nE\u2013mail\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Error\n\n\n\n\nRate this \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article has not yet been rated.\n\n\nWe want you to tell us what you think of our articles.

They say she was armed with nothing but a knife.\nChantel died as protesters were marching in the streets of America to demand change after the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by police in Minneapolis.\nShe died days before a video surfaced of Chipewyan First Nations Chief Allan Adam being brutally tackled to the ground by RCMP in Alberta. She died a little more than a week before RCMP in New Brunswick shot and killed Rodney Levi, a First Nations man suffering from mental-health issues.\nAnd in another awful juxtaposition of events, she died the day after the first anniversary of the release of the report on the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Gender Diverse people, and a week after the federal government admitted it has not created a promised action plan to address the inquiry\u2019s Calls for Justice.\nPolice have been implicated in some of those killings \u2014 the starlight drives that saw Indigenous women taken out of town in the back of a cruiser on freezing nights and left to die of exposure. Police were also implicated in shoddy investigations over the decades that resulted in little response when Indigenous families reported the disappearance of a loved one, and only slightly more interest when that loved one turned up dead.\nDespite the historical wrongs and the recent tragedies, the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada (NWAC) does not want to abolish the police, nor does it brand all officers as racists. As Indigenous women, we know all too well how unfair it is to be painted with a single brush.\nBut it is time for change.\nWe want to stop asking \u201cwhat would have happened if better protocols had been in place?\u201d We want to start making the necessary revisions to policing in this country.\nThe report of the national inquiry, which directs a number of its Calls for Justice at police forces, informs the best way forward.\nI have arranged to meet in July with RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki. In preparation for that meeting, NWAC sent a letter to her on Tuesday, and also to all of the provincial and federal ministers in Canada who are responsible for policing, including Nova Scotia Justice Minister Mark Furey, to demand three reforms that find their basis in the inquiry\u2019s recommendations.\nWe ask that all front-line police officers be equipped with body cameras.\nWe ask that \u201cshoot-to-kill\u201d orders be revised to make non-violent apprehension the imperative when suspects are not brandishing firearms, and to better train officers in de-escalation of potentially dangerous situations.\nAnd we ask, as have so many others in recent days, that some of the duties currently performed by police when called to deal with an Indigenous person who is suffering from a mental-health issue be turned over to social workers, health professionals or elders. Those people, trained in de-escalation rather than use of force, should be on the front lines 24 hours a day.\nAnd, finally, we ask Commissioner Lucki to join with NWAC and other Canadian police forces to form a task force that will rewrite the relationship between police and Indigenous women.\nThese measures would start to make life safer for Indigenous people. More change must follow.\nWe want culturally appropriate protocols that will keep our women, girls and gender diverse people safe, not just from street killers and other assailants who have targeted them as prey, but from the police themselves.\nLorraine Whitman is president of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid this story inform or enhance your

Marion Buller, the Chief Commissioner of the National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, understands the need for a process that will \"do no harm\" to the families who will share their stories in the upcoming year.\u00a0\u00a0(DARRYL DYCK / THE CANADIAN PRESS)\u00a0\u00a0By Kristy KirkupThe Canadian PressSat., Oct. 8, 2016OTTAWA \u2014 The chief commissioner for the national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women knows the world is watching her team \u2014 and she wants to assure Canadians much is happening behind the scenes, even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it.\u201cWe are moving at great speed but we are also being careful about what we are doing,\u201d Marion Buller said in an interview with The Canadian Press.Buller\u2019s remarks come after the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada (NWAC) commented earlier this week on a lack of \u201cvisible progress\u201d on the inquiry \u2014 a process budgeted to cost $53.8 million and take two years.\u201cFamily members, loved ones have been waiting for decades to be heard,\u201d NWAC\u2019s president Francyne Joe said in a statement.\u201cWe recognize that it\u2019s a big task to start a national inquiry but the lack of communication has been disappointing and worrying.\u201dArticle Continued BelowPart of the problem, Buller said, was in the way the inquiry was announced this summer, leading people to \u201cmistakenly believe\u201d sessions would start immediately.\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate that happened,\u201d she said.\u201cThose expectations were built inappropriately and unfortunately. However, when you look at the start times ... for other inquiries and other commissions, we are actually doing very, very well.\u201dThe five commissioners are now in the process of hiring staff and have named an executive director: Michele Moreau, the executive director of the Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice.The inquiry headquarters will open in Vancouver next week, Buller added, noting this will likely serve as a temporary space because there are plans to move on to reserve land in Metro Vancouver.\u201cThat\u2019s where we belong,\u201d she said.Buller, the first female First Nations judge in British Columbia, also said the commissioners are giving a lot of thought to the hearings because they will involve speaking with \u201creal people\u201d who are hurting.She said she can assure the families they are carefully putting together a process that will achieve the goal of doing no harm.\u201cWe are borrowing from the medical profession but we really want to ensure that our process supports the families before, during and after the time that they spend with us telling us their stories,\u201d she said.\u201cAlso, we want to make sure we are culturally appropriate because indigenous cultures across Canada are radically different from each other.\u201dFamilies will be given options on how to participate in the inquiry process, she noted, including the chance to speak publicly at community gatherings or in private sessions.The hearings are not expected to start until early 2017, with an interim report due in November of next year.\u201cI have no doubt that the whole world is watching but I work with a wonderful team of commissioners and we share the load,\u201d Buller said.\u201cWe are all mindful of public scrutiny ... We\u2019ve had inquiries from people all over the world so we are very much aware of that.\u201dThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star & PartnersLOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LOADING\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a013\u00b0CloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsA train headed nowhere: The Girl on the Train reviewWith Emily Blunt in title role of The Girl on the Train, a diverting beach read becomes a disappointing movie.

(Chris Wattie/Reuters)\nOTTAWA \u2013 The issue of violence against aboriginal women goes beyond the ranks of murdered and missing, Canada\u2019s indigenous affairs minister said Tuesday as she explained her claim that the tally of victims is far higher than believed.\nCarolyn Bennett made headlines earlier this week when she said the number of missing and murdered indigenous women in Canada is likely much higher than the 1,200 total put forward in reports by the RCMP.\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s cabinet meeting, she was at pains to explain herself.\nA mere roster of victims ignores the family members who have been touched by tragedy, and fails to capture the extent to which the phenomenon has affected an entire culture, Bennett said.\n\u201cI think what we\u2019re saying is that the issue that has been described as missing and murdered indigenous women is a tragedy much greater than that.\u201d\nBennett insisted she has no data to indicate the score of the problem, but said ministers have heard enough anecdotal evidence to believe the depth and breadth of the tragedy is greater than initial reports have suggested.\n\u201cThe RCMP did their very best with other levels of policing to come up with the number of 1,200,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important that we \u2026 do look to the root causes and look to this greater issue of the vulnerability\u2026 of indigenous women.\u201d\nIt is also important to hear from survivors in the inquiry process, such as those who managed to escape from their attackers, Bennett said.\n\u201cI think that when you realize that some people who know it could have been them, it was almost them, that \u2026 they actually woke up in an emergency department with bruises around their neck, that this is a much bigger problem.\u201d\nBennett said she\u2019s heard anecdotally about some cases that were classified as suicides despite obvious indications otherwise.\n\u201cSo when you hear the kinds of stories that we\u2019ve been hearing \u2014 someone who died by a shot through the back of her head is called a suicide, somebody whose arms are tied behind their back is called a suicide \u2014 you have to say that this is much greater.\u201d\nBennett has vowed the inquiry will take place at arm\u2019s length from the government once it is up and running, hopefully by this summer.\nA number of questions still need to be answered, including how many commissioners will be enlisted and whether the Liberal \u201cplaceholder budget\u201d of $40 million for a two-year study will be sufficient for the inquiry.\nDawn Lavell-Harvard, the president of the The Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, said the inquiry must be all-encompassing in order to develop effective solutions.\n\u201cIt has to leave no stone unturned,\u201d Lavell-Harvard said.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have a lopsided inquiry that is only looking at one side or the other in particular circumstances. We can\u2019t shy away from any aspect of this if we want really good solutions, if we want to really understand the enormity of the problem.\u201d\nLavell-Harvard said it is already clear women lack safe places to go when they are in crisis; her association has been calling for years on the federal government to build more shelter facilities.\n\u201cThat needs to be addressed right away,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to wait two years for an inquiry to tell us something \u2026 we knew going into this conversation.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Twitter            \n\n\n\n                Facebook            \n\n\n\n                Google+ Share            \n\n\n\n                LinkedIn            \n\n\n\n                Reddit            \n\n\n\n                Email            \n\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under:\n\n\nCarolyn Bennett\nMissing and murdered indigenous women\nMMIW\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout this author\n\n\nKristy Kirkup, The Canadian Press\n\nMacleans.ca author\n\n\nOther articles\nMulcair shoulders blame for campaign in letter to NDP supporters\nNDP's 'cautious change' did not resound with voters in election: report\n\n\n+ 3 more posts this week\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\n\nPrevious Read the best we have to offer with the new Maclean\u2019s app.\n\n\nNext \u2018I raised the individual who did this\u2019: Columbine mother speaks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a comment\nHide comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cancel reply\n\nSign in to comment.You're logged in as  .

Then Let the Youth Lead \n\n\nWhen The Tyee\u2019s Katie Hyslop won a major honour, here\u2019s how she used the platform it provided.\n\n\n\n Fontaine\u2019s body was pulled from the Red River in Winnipeg in 2014, wrapped in a duvet weighted down with rocks. A 57-year-old man was charged with her murder, tried and found not guilty. The report on her life and death is worth reading, but unsurprising. We\u2019ve read too many similar reports over the last two decades.\nFontaine was from the Sagkeeng First Nation, and her killing highlights the terribly high risk of death for young Indigenous women. Their families are four or five times as likely to get a knock on the door and the news that their teenage daughters or granddaughters are missing, or dead.\nTo be Indigenous in Canada means knowing that death is always closer than it is for non-Indigenous people. For you, your friends, your children, your parents.\n\n\n\n\nBut for people like Tina Fontaine \u2014 in her teens, female and living on reserve until shortly before her death \u2014 that risk is particularly acute.\n\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0Tyee\u00a0is\u00a0supported by\u00a0readers\u00a0like\u00a0you\n\n\n\n\n\n Join us and grow independent\u00a0media in\u00a0Canada\n\n\n  For girls 15 to 19 living on reserve, the death rate is almost five times greater than it is for their non-Indigenous counterparts. For Indigenous boys in the same group, the death rate is almost four times greater than the comparable general population. Both are terrible, but young women face the greater relative risk.\nBeing a girl between 10 and 14 living on reserve means you are much more likely to die than other Canadian kids. More likely to die than your sisters living off reserve. And more likely to die than the men and boys in your own age group on reserve, a huge aberration given the generally higher mortality rates for boys and young men.\nThis information is all from a major research project by Donna Feir of the University of Victoria and Randall Akee of UCLA that was released last year to virtually no media attention. The study, they note, produced the \u201cmost comprehensive set of estimates to date for Status First Nations mortality.\u201d\nAnd it revealed, or confirmed, that something is terribly wrong in the lives of young Indigenous women.\n\u201cStatus women and girls have mortality rates that are three to four times that of the general female mortality rates between the ages of 10 and 44,\u201d the report found. \u201cThese relative mortality rates are statistically higher than the relative mortality rates for Status males, which are themselves two to two-and-a-half times that of the general population.\u201d\nBeing an Indigenous boy or man means you\u2019re at much greater risk of dying young than non-Indigenous people. Being an Indigenous girl or woman is worse.\nThe 2018 study is the first to identify \u201cthe disproportionately high mortality rates borne by Status women and girls at such young ages at the national level.\u201d\nThat in itself is discouraging, as the issue of missing and murdered women is hardly new. We simply haven\u2019t paid enough attention to the fact that young Indigenous women have been dying at alarming rates.\nThe report offered more disturbing findings. The researchers looked at mortality rates for Native Americans and African Americans. Neither group had increased rates of death as disproportionately high as Canada\u2019s Indigenous population, although \u201cNative Americans and African Americans are among the most at-risk and impoverished groups in the U.S.\u201d \nAnd neither had the same \u201cextreme\u201d higher relative mortality rates for women and girls. For all the problems in the U.S. \u2014 and Canadian sanctimony \u2014 we are the outliers. We live with the reality that Indigenous women and girls in Canada face a far higher risk of death.\nWorse, we have lived with it for decades. The study looked at data since 1973 and found that \u201cmortality rates have not improved for women and girls on reservation in the last 30 years, and relative mortality rates have not improved on-reserve for all Status people in the past 40 years.\u201d  \nThere have been improvements in life expectancy for Indigenous people who are living off reserve, but not those living in traditional communities.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur findings suggest that the marginalization of Indigenous women and girls is more widespread and systemic than previously documented,\u201d the report concludes, in an understated way.\nFor decades Indigenous women and girls have been dying too soon, with no effective response from any level or form of government.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine such deadly, discriminatory outcomes being ignored in other communities. About 330,000 Indigenous people live on reserve, a population not far off Greater Victoria\u2019s. If young Victoria women were dying at five times the rate of their counterparts in the rest of the country, the response from government and the public would be instant.\nThe traditional end for these kinds of columns is to write something vaguely hopeful, along the lines of: \u201cIf Tina Fontaine\u2019s death is to mean anything, then it must lead to action on the terrible inequity in death rates for young Indigenous women and girls.\u201d\nBut after so many deaths, that kind of bland expression of hope seems either stupid or cynical.\nSo far, we\u2019ve shown we just don\u2019t care about these death rates. It will take more than hope, or one teen\u2019s death, to change that. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Share on Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Share on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 Forward by Email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nShare article via email\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend this article to:\n\n\n\nYour email address:\n\n\n\nYour message:\n\n\n\nWould you like to receive The Tyee's headlines free by email?\n\n\n\n                                    Yes, every day.\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Yes, once a week.\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    Yes, once a week, national news only.\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    I already subscribe.\n                                \n\n\n\n\n                                    No, thanks.\n                                \n\n\n\nSubmit\n\nShow form again \u00bb\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0Tyee\u00a0is\u00a0supported by\u00a0readers\u00a0like\u00a0you\n\n\n\n\n\n Join us and grow independent\u00a0media in\u00a0Canada\n\n\n\n\nGet The Tyee in your inbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily\nWeekly\nNational (weekly)\n\n\n\nSubscribe now\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily\nWeekly\nNational (weekly)\n\nSubscribe now\nPrivacy policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\nYour privacy is important to us.\n\n\nWhen subscribing to a newsletter edition you'll also get early notice on Tyee events, news, promotions, partner messages and special initiatives.\nFurther to the provision of the Personal Information Protection Act, personal information is kept confidential by TheTyee.ca and will not be sold, traded, released, shared or distributed to any other individuals, organizations or agencies without prior consent or notification.\nMeasures have been enacted to ensure the integrity of personal information and to protect it from misuse, loss or alteration.
