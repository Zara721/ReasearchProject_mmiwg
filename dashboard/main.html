By extracting and filtering data from the gkg that pertains to Canada and Indigenous people, I will analyze the resulting data and use various forms of data representation to identify different trends and truths about MMIWG.

                    C is a procedural programming language. It

                    language include low-level access to memory,
                    simple set of keywords, and clean style,

                    system programming like operating system or
                    compiler development.
