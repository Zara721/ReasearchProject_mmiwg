                    The MMIWG Research Project Dashboard is a visual exploration of the representation of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) in global media. Utilizing data from the GDELT project, specifically the Global Knowledge Graph (GKG) database, I employed SQL queries to filter data based on specific criteria, such as location, keywords, and themes, to extract relevant information. Additionally, I utilized k-means clustering to identify non-relevant articles and refine my queries further. After extensive data filtering and refinement, I narrowed down the dataset to around 20,000 relevant entries from the original 1.8 million, ensuring a more focused analysis of the representation of MMIWG in the news. After removing duplicates and doing more using keywords, themes, and proper names to do further filtering, I had a subset of around 1,703 entries for in-depth analysis. <br>

                    <br>This dashboard provides a unique perspective on how MMIWG issues are reported and perceived across various news sites.Â The primary dataset for the following visualizations consists of the subset of 1703 entries, analyzing article counts, thematic trends, domain names, and word clouds derived from articles published between 2015 and 2024. Notably, for the word cloud, only ~1000 URLs were used, as those were the ones whose title and body text were successfully retrieved by my web scraping program.

                    The bar chart below shows the number of articles retrieved from 2015 to 2024. Most notably, there is a pretty even amount of around 250 articles from 2015-2019, followed by a sharp drop off in 2020 that is roughly maintained till 2024. However, it should be noted that although I filtered out a large percentage of duplicate articles, with each URL left being unique, there is still a certain percentage of URLs that link to the same article as others despite being hosted on different websites, which will have some effect on the data.

                <p class="text-small">
                    The bar charts below illustrate the distribution of the themes that appeared the most in the articles. However, because the GDELT algorithm automatically picked up on the different themes present on a page, this affects the accuracy, with themes mainly being identified by textual search instead of a more complex neural network. This sort of search also includes text that wasn't directly about the article in question but is simply present on the page, like previews for other articles.<br>

                    <br>While most of the themes listed are very general, some are generalized to the point of lacking meaningful information. For example, TAX_FNACT simply means there was an actor. So, themes like TAX_FNACT_INDIGENOUS mean that there is an Indigenous person mentioned in the article. Moreover, the theme KILL and themes that include the term INDIGENOUS are mentioned in virtually every article because those are keywords used to get relevant articles from the larger dataset, making their presence biased.
                    Furthermore, when making the top 10 themes for each year, some themes that were too generalized were excluded. The exluded themes were 'TAX_FNCACT', 'AFFECT', 'Unnamed: 101', 'TAX_ETHNICITY', and 'CRISISLEX_CRISISLEXREC'.

                    The graph below shows the distribution of domain names for the 1703 articles in the mmiwg events database. The initial graph could have been more accurate, as domain names from the same domain but with different versions, like www.ctvnews.ca and winnipeg.ctvnews.ca, were categorized under different domains. To fix this issue, I manually made lists of various versions of the same domain and then aggregated the counts for the graph below.

                    The word clouds below visualize all the text in the article titles, article bodies, and names. The larger the word appears in the word cloud, the more often it is mentioned within the respective body of text. To prepare the data so that I could use it to make the word clouds, the raw data taken from the websites had to be cleaned. I did this by normalizing the data (converting it to decomposed form to help standardize the representation of characters), converting all uppercase to lowercase and removing non-alphanumeric characters (letters and digits).<br> 

                <br>For the word cloud with all names, additional cleaning had to be done, including removing all the numbers and replacing all semicolons with spaces. This extra prep was necessary because the all names data is from the GDELT database, where each article has an entry list of all proper names referenced in the document, with the names separated by semicolons instead of spaces.
