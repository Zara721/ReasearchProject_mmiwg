                    //Note to self update text; Using data obtained from the GDELT project, specifically the Global Knowledge Graph (gkg) dataset, this project aims to study how MMIWG is represented in the news. By extracting and filtering data from the gkg that pertains to Canada and Indigenous people, I will analyze the resulting data and use various forms of data representation to identify different trends and truths about MMIWG.

                    C is a procedural programming language. It

                    language include low-level access to memory,

                    system programming like operating system or
